We spent most of our visit in the larger west wing. The American artist section and the impressionists were our favourite. The building itself is worth the visit alone. Staff were very knowledgable and helpful. The smaller east wing was interesting particularly the American artists section. Both museums are interconnected so you do not need to go through security twice. The connecting walkway is cool.,October 2019,50,Smithsonian American Art Museum,GarryUK,"Extensive collection of art from all periods, gorgeous building."
Best visted when dry (or a few days after heavy rains) when the paths aren't puddly or under water.  Nice circular walk or area to run.,October 2019,40,Tidal Basin,Kayakgirly,Lovely area to stretch your legs
"We joined an ordinary tour. They have it every 10 minutes with the capacity of 250 people each. So, do not miss it, not much of queuing. We were lucky with the guide, he was knowledgeable and fun. The Rotonda(underneath the dome) was the most impressive part.",December 2019,50,Capitol Hill,Ksksksksks,"Landmark, worth it, quick"

Personalized tours of the mansion are also available throughout the day. I opted for the audio tour.  While I enjoyed roaming the gardens and greenhouse, I found the suggested entry fee high.

"This museum was the one thing I really wanted to see in DC and I was not disappointed. I really loved the bones exhibit with skeletons of all sorts of animals and drove my friend crazy with my prolonged interest and extended time spent reading the signs. The gems and minerals was also really neat and I loved seeing the Hope diamond which I’ve heard about!

"It was really cool to see the original Declaration of Independence and Constitution, but there was a lot of confusion. The staff kept telling us there was no line to see the documents, but it was obvious people were lining up to be able to see them up close. Then they stopped controlling the number of people who could go in the area to see those documents and it got really chaotic. It just seemed like it could have been better organized. ",October 2019,30,The National Archives Museum,allygator78,Very cool just not well organized

"I have been to DC many times and had never thought about coming to the National Archives Museum, but while we were on tour on a hop on and hop off bus, the tour guide highly recommended that we must see this Museum and it should not be missed by any DC visitors.

"My visit here was pleasant , but not as good as I expected.  There was not as much directly related to the Lincoln assasination as I thought there would be.  You first go through their museum.  It is devoted to the entire Civil War period--not specifically the assasination.  You then go into the theatre.  You can see the Presidential box to your right--but that is as close as you get.  Someone in period costume then comes on stage and talks to you about Lincoln.  But, again, the talk is not centered on the assasination that occurred there.  ",June 2019,30,Georgetown,Robert H,Not as good as I expected
"A few all look the same, including the hotel (it was a post office years ago).  The art work is really something to see.  I think this is more of a ‘grown up’ museum if anything.  The atrium was a pleasant surprise to see, really nice.  Expensive gift shop, lots of democratic stuff if one is interested.

Learned really interesting facts about the mill, it's history and history of the area.  There is parking nearby or you can access it if you're walking through the park.  There's a dog water bowl outside the door and the guide had a box of dog biscuits.

It was originally restored back in the 1930s; you can do a self guided tour and read signage explaining the history, but there were several docents there to explain the different equipment and steps in the milling process. You can explore several levels of the building, but it's a pretty quick stop. Shouldn't be on the top of your DC ""to do"" list, but a nice change of pace for locals or more in depth trips.

You will see the originals of very special documents pertaining to the history and foundation of the United States.  The documents are not brightly lit (as light deteriorates them) and generally, are very difficult to read.  If you must read them, you must do them elsewhere (online, for example), as not only are they impossible to read right there, the time you have at each document is really quite limited due to the number of people there.  What you will see is faded writing on delicate yellowing paper.

In my view it is the best bridge for views up and down the Potomac and watching the planes coming in over the Potomac (right over your head) to the airport.

Pretty large turnout (I'd estimate several hundred), mostly composed of families with young children on a beautiful late summer evening.  The IDEA was wonderful; but the execution was wanting: the Consort group (actually a quartet of its members plus a singer) chose a theme and style of musical offerings that required serious attention that no one in the crowd had any interest in giving; and the Rap group started out strong each time but devoted themselves to weak-tea, custom responses to the more classical offerings that hardly anyone responded to.

"Another piece of 'forgotten Washington' and 'Forgotten History' about the Monument.  In 1783 (6 years before the Constitution and the Country we call home) the Continental Congress voted funds for a statue of Washington.  After the Country was born, L'Enfant, the architect of the City, planned the statue to be at this spot, the intersection of a surveying line extending south from the place where the Presidents house was being built and the hill to the east where the Capitol was being built.  It was marked, and the statue was to become a 'Centerpiece' in the capital city.  But it never happened - for political and geological reasons!  First, the Jeffersonians were upset that Washington had become a symbol for their political enemies, the Federalists (You think our political campaigns are tough? Read about the campaign of 1800).  Then there was a struggle about funding, control and the type of memorial (statue or obelisk) between members of the group supporting the effort.  By the 1840s they had settled on an obelisk rather than a statue.  But when the builders and geological scientists actually started examining the ground at the location, they discovered that it would not support the massive weight of this monument.  So the foundation area was moved 390 feet southeast to the present location of the monument.  But through the years, this small marker, known as the Jefferson Pier (because when it was first surveyed in the 1790s, Jefferson was the Secretary of State and supervised the efforts) has remained here.  It is small, only about two feet high, and about 2 feet square, on a small concrete base.  If you view the whole monument area as an aerial, top-down 'clock face' view with the monument as the center, stand in with the Monument at your back facing the Capitol Building and the Monument Lodge.  OK, you are facing at 12 O'Clock on this dial.  Now imagine roughly 7 O'Clock on this dial.  This is where the Jefferson Pier is located(pier as in pole or column) about 390 feet away from the present day Washington Monument, down a slope.  If you have a timed ticket for the Monument, or are just walking around it, find time to walk over and see where this 'Centerpiece' in honour of Washington the person and the City should have been!

"We saw ""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"" at the end of February 2015, a ""dark comedy"" play that was very enjoyable.

"I have done this hike many times but yesterday was amazing and a new experience! This excellent section of the C&O Canal is outside of DC and in Maryland with plenty of wildlife viewing! This is a very popular hike, run, boat and bike for hundreds of outdoor enthusiasts with spectacular views of the Potomac River. Parking at the lots across from Old Anglers Inn is very difficult unless you arrive at 8 AM! By 9AM on a nice weekend, the lots are full and cars spill out onto the roadside where tickets can be issued. If you drive up the hill a bit further west, there is a neighborhood on the right where you can park. The hike along the ""Tow Path"" follows the canal where barges previously traveled between locks. There is also a parallel pathway through the woods a bit further up the hill that can be used a loop hike. The canal's water is perfect habitat for two types of turtles, a few species of fish, plenty of birds feeding on fish, small mammals and much more! Be sure to bring a camera and binoculars! Along the path near Lock 16 is Great Falls Overlook that is accessed by a wooden walk way to the viewing platform. Stay on the trail, off trail walking is not permitted. Further to Lock 18 is where you come to Great Falls Tavern and the historic barge being towed by mules by people in period dress. Fun for the kids and old alike! You can also access this location by car from the pay entrance to Great Falls Park on the Maryland side of the Potomac River, take River Road. Take water, picnic lunch, bug spray and sun screen. You can walk as far as you want, the canal tow path is 184.5 miles long from the heart of Georgetown in Washington DC to Cumberland Maryland. This can be done on a mountain bike as well. A popular off canal hike along this section of the towpath is Billy Goat Trail Section ""A"". This is a difficult and strenuous trail to hike and not for everyone!

But at the moment, they have a tiny collection of historical photos on display on the upper level of the Atlas Performing Arts Center (1333 H St. NE).  It's a fairly bedraggled and accidental collection of some 30 family and historical photos, some from the present day, some going back to the early 20th Century...mostly single and group portraits.    When compared to the African-American and Holocaust Museums, it's embarrassing, really.

"If you live in Virginia this place is really hard to get to.  Check your map and GPS.  As a beer lover, it was worth the trip.  3 Stars is located in an old warehouse area, and like much of DC, there was trash on the streets with tall weeds and vegetation that hasn’t been cared for in years.  Glad I went here in the daytime. Inside the brewery it looks totally different with painted wall art everywhere.  On tap 3 Stars has lots of choices.  Before I thought of 3 Stars as predominantly IPA, but once inside I found they have a much broader repertoire with some tasty sours, to some browns, ryes, and stouts. Impressive lineup and very good quality beer.  Very clear they are passionate about beer and their pursuit of perfection is good for all of us who visit.  There was one thing that struck me as really odd and that was the complicated process to get a beer.  First I went to the bar where I could read the menu and asked for a beer.  The man behind the bar told me, I had to go to the other side and order.  So I went over, placed my order, made payment, set up the tab, and then waited. A short while later, my beer showed up.  Don’t get me wrong, it works, just seemed strange. What is does is keep overhead down with minimal staff, good for brewery, but it prohibits conversation with the team that pours beer, bad for customers. Serious beer drinkers --put 3 Stars on your to do list.",September 2018,40,3 Stars Brewing Company,J Warren R,Well worth a visit
"So... we asked people in the area where some good breweries were and 3 Stars was suggested as one of them. We arrived on a Saturday and they were pretty busy. There wasn't one table available. We stood in the short line and eventually told the guy at the counter to the right of us that we would like to order a flight. He rudely told us we had to wait for the woman at the register (how would we know?!). The woman working the register and taking orders was the only relatively nice person in the establishment. Both men pouring the beer were just plain miserable. When we got our flights a table became opened. Next to our table was a barrel with empty glasses on it. One of the guys working came over, grabbed all of the glasses while talking to himself the whole time about people leaving stuff where they shouldn't, etc. Just plain miserable. He's there to work. That really annoyed me. They close at 7pm on Saturdays, which is pretty early and nothing to be miserable about. My boyfriend wanted to buy some beer to bring home, but we decided against it after witnessing the people who work there. I didn't want anything to do with that place. My boyfriend works at a brewery where people go to hang out because they feel comfortable and like to enjoy good beer and conversation.

They have subtitles on two mini-screens on each side of the small stage, so no trouble watching the excellent acting and reading the lines in English. It's a great locale in DC's newest hip nabe - lots of bars and restaurants nearby (Tio's good for Mexican). And if you're someone who likes to support local theater, as I go, it's perfect.

It took over 10 minutes at the counter to get tickets, because ""the system was being slow"", which ultimately, I just put cash on the counter and walked away.  When my kids asked why the cash register didn't work, I suggested maybe it ""needed new batteries,"" like moms do, and the employee barked back that ""it's broken!""  Okay then.

There's firetruck area, no actual vehicle, just four boards painted like one and with a single seat, a single wheel, and a single button.

"We went to the National Children’s Museum on Christmas Eve with our 3 year old and 3 month old.  We weren’t that impressed overall.  When we got there (right at 10am when it was opening), there was a long line outside of the building.  This line moved slowly, as there were only two people to check you in.  They do not have much waiting area inside, so people waiting to get in have to wait outdoors.  Entry is rather pricey at $10 per person (child or adult, excluding infants).  You also have to pay for garage parking ($5 for 2 hours).  The museum is not very large, and when we went it was very crowded.  By the time we left (at 11:30), they were not letting people in again until noon because it was so crowded.  There was a line to get into the 3 and under area, as well, because it was at capacity.  The museum was very clean, nice restrooms, and some good ideas, but pretty small.  Each play area (crane, firetruck, kitchen, etc.) could really only accommodate a few children.  The fire truck was pretty cool, but it is crowded in with the pizza place and the campaign center, a bunk bed, and a small grocery area.  I think that the campaign center idea is above the heads of the ages that the museum is best suited for and when it was crowded, you couldn’t really get a turn at everything.  Lots of the things that looked interesting to children (e.g., items in the grocery store on the top shelf, the food in the refrigerator in the kitchen) were not hands on items, and children couldn’t play with them.  This being said, my 3 year old had a good time anyway.  It might be a lot more fun if it was less crowded.  In the future, we would rather go to Port Discovery or one of the Smithsonian museums.  There are other fun things to do at National Harbor though, and my son had just as much fun looking at the boats and walking on the dock.",December 2012,20,National Children's Museum,klada61,Not Impressed

"My fiancée and I like to seek out micro-distilleries when we vacation. We did a bit of research before our recent trip to D.C and decided to swing by Republic Restoratives at the corner of NY Ave and Fenwick in a swanky renovated warehouse in Ivy City. During the research before our visit we found this distillery makes Vodka (my fave), Bourbon (fiancée's fave) and Whiskey and was started by an all female crew. There's also mention that this is a crowd funded distillery - why didn't I think of that??? - with heavy neighborhood involvement! When we walked in the decor is still kept very ""warehouse"" with a modern decor. The bartender greeted us warmly pointed out their drink menu and asked us what we'd like to drink. I like to ask bartenders to make something creative of their choosing made with vodka and I tend to prefer citrusy flavors. He did not disappoint when I was presented with a lime, mint & cucumber flavored libation! RR was hosting a book signing that evening so some light setup and prep were going on. We spoke to both bartenders to get more details on their location and distilling process. We had another round and left with a bottle of VERY REASONABLY priced vodka and a couple new friends! I highly suggest visiting this distillery and take the tour if you have time (due to the special event no tours were happening this evening).

"We were visiting DC to celebrate our daughter's 24th birthday, and we were looking for a Saturday afternoon activity that a group of us would enjoy. Emma suggested touring the New Columbia Distillers, producers of ""Green Hat Gin"", a popular gin found in many DC-area bars & restaurants.

It is surprisingly small, and has a very loose and friendly vibe, and your visit begins with a taste of their signature Green Hat gin. The business is owned by a retired lawyer (Michael) and his son-in-law, and Michael was our tour guide and he was an engaging and highly informative host, walking us through the small plant and the process that turns wheat into gin. They make 3 different gins: a winter gin, a spring gin and a regular gin, although they hadn't begun producing this year's winter offering yet. The actual bottling of the finished product was being done by a crew of volunteers, who seemed to be having a good time. You can email to schedule a bottling session, and they're currently scheduling for March, 2015, Michael told us, so it must be popular. You may purchase the finished product ($34), as well as T-shirts, a book and a few other items. The distillers are diligently working on a rye whiskey to grow their product line, but Michael hasn't found the perfect blend yet, and won't start producing until he is satisfied with his product.

I left feeling as though I'd known him for quite sometime and could fully imagine what the rooms would have looked like had he been alive... a testament to the guide that took me through the house.

"Foundry United Methodist Church has been a spiritual leader in the nation's capital for more than 200 years. In a city often characterized by transience and change, Foundry has remained a steadfast beacon, long recognized for its commitment to mission service, social justice and reconciliation. Originally located at 14th and G Street when it was founded in 1815,  the church today is located at 16th and P Streets Northwest in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood, one mile north of the White House. For two centuries, the church has been home to presidents, members of Congress and others in public service. John Adams was the first president to attend Sunday services. Abraham Lincoln became a Life Director of the Methodist Missionary Society and Rutherford B. Hayes attended Foundry nearly every Sunday during his term. Perhaps the most famous event held at the church was on December 25, 1941, when Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attended a special service during a time when the two world leaders were sealing their commitment to battle Nazi Germany in World War II. Bill Clinton and his family attended regularly. Curiously, there is a pew where all visiting dignitaries have sat. Roosevelt's and Churchill's names are engraved on plaques. So is George Washington's. But he died several years before the church was built. It is an old-time church with a balcony on both sides and a pulpit overlooking the congregation from high above the altar. The word Foundry comes from the fact that Henry Foxall, a Methodist layman and an influential businessman, donated the land and original building after his Georgetown iron foundry survived the British attack on Washington, D.C., in the War of 1812.",July 2015,50,Foundry United Methodist Church,Taylor B,Where Roosevelt and Churchill worshiped

"The Battle of Monocacy is labeled as ""The Battle That Saved Washington"" during the Civil War. Fought near Frederick, Maryland, on July 9, 1864, Union forces were defeated by Confederate troops. But they delayed the Confederate march toward Washington long enough for the Union Army to regroup and finally repulse the Confederates at Fort Stevens on July 11-12. Fort Stevens was part of the extensive 37-mile-long arrangement of 68 fortifications built around Washington, D.C., during the Civil War. Constructed in 1861, it had a perimeter of 168 yards and places for 10 cannon. In 1862, it was expanded to 375 yards and 19 guns. It guarded the northern approach to the nation's capital, the Seventh Street Turnpike. After being delayed at Monocacy, the Confederates advanced on Washington, D.C., and cavalry attacked Fort Stevens. There was consistent skirmishing and sharpshooting for two days before the Confederates crossed the Potomac River and retreated to Virginia, leaving behind 101 wounded soldiers, including 11 officers. According to many accounts, President Abraham Lincoln rode out to the fort on both days to observe the attack and was briefly under fire by sharpshooters. After the war, Fort Stevens was abandoned. The site, near Georgia Avenue at 13th Street and Quackenbos Street Northwest, includes a stone memorial, a historical marker, earthworks, cannons, a portion of the parapet and one magazine, is now maintained by the National Park Service. The remains of 41 Union soldiers who died in the battle are buried on the grounds of nearby Battleground National Cemetery.",August 2016,50,Fort Stevens,Taylor B,The battle that REALLY saved Washington

"The Spanish Steps is also known officially as Decatur Terrace.  According to the fact sheet, this is the only steps in Washington DC to be built on land dedicated for street (in this case 22nd street) to connect the two streets together (S street and Decatur Terrace).  The name ""Spanish Steps"" because the steps was built to resemble the Renaissance staircase in Rome.  It is a small area tugged in between old buildings and Embassies and Ambassadors' residence linking upper Embassy Row to the lower Embassy Row and DuPont Circle area. When travelers are in DuPont Circle for entertainment and eating during day time, include the Spanish Step in the agenda.

We were in search of the frequently hidden and obscure public restroom when we came across the welcome center. As with everything in DC security is tight but all we needed to do was to leave a small deposit. We had a package that included two donuts and you would have thought they were bombs. The security guard we encountered was a prime example of someone with a minimum wage job with a minimum IQ given a little authority and they think they are the head of the secret service. After being interrogated we decided I would stay outside with the contraband. After my partner came back out we consumed the contraband and went inside. The inside was just wonderful. I am so glad we accidentally discovered this jewel. It has exhibits about the history of the White House. This was very informative and a good replacement of actually touring the White House.

"DC Brau offers some good beers, but is lacking when it comes to comfort and hospitality. The brewery itself is similar to most breweries, but DC Brau lacks a tasting room large enough to handle the crowds it attracts on weekends. Within the actual tasting room, there are only 3 tables, which pretty much go to the first three groups that walk through the door. After that, you are relegated to a couple of tables in the warehouse space or just standing around next to the machinery. While this is fine for some, I like a more welcoming place where I can hang out for several hours and enjoy my beers. Hopefully they are planning on expanding/renovating to really make this a great place to hang out.

Some of the services there are very special, mystical, almost mysterious,,, the whole church dark in the evening with dozens of red candles illuminating the altar area... These services are offered around Xmas and Lent time etc. Check their website. These are often followed by receptions with good quality food and a chance to mingle with other people and the friars who are quite friendly.

Many people associate Dumbarton Oaks with beautiful garden. However the Dumbarton Oaks Museum is worth visiting.  The museum is small with the entrance on 32nd Street. It is know to visitors for the collection of Byzantine and Pre-Columbian art. The music room is the display space of the former residence and is also used for functions. The music room contains collection of Western medieval and Renaissance art and furniture.

We are used to being greeted with a friendly welcome in most museums we've visited so we were taken aback by the way we were totally ignored by the 'gentleman' on the reception.  The signage was poor too.  The initial room was dedicated to an exhibition on Juggling the Middle Ages which focused on the Legend of the Juggler - interesting but rather muddled in curation as we only found the remainder of the exhibition at the end of our visit. The Byzantine collection is beautiful and the Pre-Columbian artefacts amazing in a stunning purpose built set of galleries.  Thank you to a wonderful museum guide (Jerald?) who unobtrusively introduced himself in the Pre-Columbian rooms and talked with knowledge and enthusiasm about the exhibits.

"Tucked away in an exclusive area of Georgetown, Hillwood is a glimpse into the life and passions of Marjorie Merriweather Post, who lived here before turning her home into a museum. The grounds at Hillwood are wonderful - spring is especially lovely as the many azaleas bloom throughout the garden. The Japanese garden is a highlight, though the uneven paths and bridges may be a challenge for less sure footed visitors. The mansion is plain outside, not at all hinting at the riot of color and objects within. Post collected many religious and royal artworks and items from Imperial Russia and the house teems with precious objects. Visitors who like a lot of information in a museum will be disappointed - there are almost no signs with information and the guide book and guided tours only touch on the highlights. We questioned a staff member about an item and were told to look it up on the museum website - not a great response in our opinion. The working parts of the house are a part of the tour, which is a nice addition, and much is made of Post's lifestyle and entertaining.

"The building is absolutely lovely, and the bulk of the permanent collection are set up in dramatic rooms ""salon style"" meaning hung in rows all the way to the ceiling. This really drops the viewer back in time to the era at the turn of the century when salon exhibitions opened up the world to new artists and techniques. That said, in this style of display there can be no placards identifying the art or giving information about it, so the museum has prepared laminated cards that you carry about with you (challenging if you are holding a child and carrying a purse or a cane) and try, with some difficulty, to match the piece with its number on the card. The cards are also numbered from left to right, meaning to identify the art with ease, you'd have to cross the gallery and ""return"" like a typewriter carriage to see the next row. I stand in one spot and look from ceiling to floor, so I had to hunt for the information on the next artist. And there was no other information on the artist other than name, life dates, and the date the piece was done.

The statue is of a young man in a long coat with arms outstretched. Is this where James Cameron got the idea for the actors to do the same on the bow of the ship in the movie? The memoial is at the very south end of the SW wharf, a pleasant walk from the big development or waterfront metro stop. Sadly, the national park property in which it is situated is a bit neglected.  Lots of uneven pavement but some new benches. You can sit at the base of the monument itself and watch the planes coming and going from DCA.

"I went on a party in this wonderful place. Don't know if they provided the music but the evening was perfect with fun people, good drinks and a wonderful ambience. At the end of the vening, my colleague went upstairs to get more drinks (lines were a lot shorter there) then came down to get me since he'd ordered more than he could carry (we were there with a larger group). When we tried to go up we were stoped by a security woman who informed us that the upstairs area was closed and no one was allowed to go up, only down. We told her that we had our drinks up there on which she replied that it's not her problem, no one was allowed to go up. When I got angry and asked how we should get the drinks we just paid, I was told to move away from the stairs, or else. I've never run into such an unfriendly person in my life. We then walked to the other staircase where a guy stod but he was even worse, no one was going up, no matter what, to bad that we just spent a lot of money on drinks. I can understand this kind of behavior in a Nazi concentration camp but I've never been treated like this before in a club and I've been to a lot of places all over the world.

"The bad: Here are some awful things about how the Howard Theater and specifically the Beres Hammond concert on 8/16/19 that I attended. The first issue is that there was a House DJ who blew out our eardrums with intense volume music for his overextended playtime. He wasted our time for well over 2.5 hours of playtime. The concert (one act only- Beres Hammond) was supposed to start at 8 pm. Instead Beres came on at 9:45 pm! Nearly 1 hour and 45 minutes later than he was supposed to. That is ridiculous delay considering he was the only act. The DJ of Howard Theater played music from 6:30-9:00 pm after which our eardrums were fried. Then ANOTHER DJ who was Jamaican (nice guy to be honest) from the entourage of Beres Hammond took over after the curtain lifted (DJ Fano?) and he literally DJ's for another 45 minutes of intense eardrum-cracking music. Now how can you have 2 DJ's at a reggae concert when the main act is supposed to come out at 8 pm and instead chooses to come out at 9:45 pm. Is that the fault of Howard Theater for poor planning??? Or is it Beres Hammond who held everything up?? Impossible to know but if you are the venue (Howard Theater management), you have an obligation to make sure the musical acts go out within a short and reasonable window of the planned concert time (in this case 8 pm became almost 10 pm). That is simply one of the worst planned concerts I have been to. Wolftrap, Verizon Center, and Hamilton all have had big name acts and smaller acts that truly start their concerts on time.

"We attended a matinee performance of ""Amadeus"", which was superbly performed and very entertaining.  Arriving early, we had some time to appreciate the history information and the lobby exhibits, which we'll certainly have to re-visit at some point when we have more time. The theater was built in the 1920s and is lovely inside, although some of the beautiful wood effect is lost with spotlights and other equipment added.  It didn't seem as though the view of the stage would be affected, however. Seats are a bit narrow though comfortable, probably reflecting the smaller size of people at the time the theater was built. Rest rooms are downstairs, and, as usual, the ladies' room lacks a sufficient number of stalls, which seems to be the case everywhere. There are racks to hang coats, but no coat check service. The performance began on time, had one 15-minute intermission. It was a great play which we enjoyed very much and look forward to seeing other shows at the Folger now that we know how wonderful a place it is!

"Although I've been to the remodeled Howard Theatre many times before, it was for meetings; never a musical event. Well, I finally attended a concert. And, although the tickets said ""..limited seating, 'General Admission' (standing room only)"", I took a leap of faith that I wouldn't have to stand for approximately 4 hours (NOTE: Doors open 2 hrs. prior to performances). I made a concerted effort to arrive no later than 1 hour before the concert.....and VOILA!!  I not only got a seat, but was escorted to a seat practically ON the stage. I was seated at a table (VERY TIGHTLY CONFIGURED) where I actually met some very nice folks. Yeah; that kind of closeness actually forces you to get to know folks :) There is also some 'banquette' seating around the walls away from the stage...also, a second floor/balcony of seats (which were closed the night I was there). Now, I knew that there was a $10 minimum charge/fee for food for seated attendees but I'd also heard not-so-good things about the food service. I hesitantly ordered the tilapia tacos...and they were pretty good abeit pricey. The glass of water TASTED awful. A tablemate mentioned that it was due to the chlorine that the city government had recently flushed through the system. I just could not drink it, so, I ordered a ginger ale. It was better than the water...but, not alot. BE FOREWARNED: Your bill will include taxes, service charges, gratuities, etc. So, for 3 'light' tilapia tacos and a glass of ginger ale, my food totaled exactly $20.00. The tacos were just okay; I'm sure I could have gotten better fish tacos and a soda at any local restaurant for about 1/2 of that amount. But, I digress. On the music side, the acoustics are great!  The venue has very nice bathrooms, too. I plan to return, but know that I must make a choice to stand (and not order food) or sit (and be required to order food).

The sound system was great and even though not needed, the two big screen TVs enhanced the viewing experience. We were seated right away and the show started exactly at the scheduled time. Based on other reviews, we ate before the show. Drink prices are a little steep ($10 for screwdriver). After the concert was finished, they kept playing salsa over the music system. They closed the bar after the live music ended but quickly realized that was not a good move. Many people (including us) stayed and were dancing.

I was hoping that things had improved since many of the reviews I’d read had been published back in April just after the theater’s re-opening. I was disappointed. After paying $125.00 for ONE ticket+$20 for parking, I was crowded into a small space, harassed by security, and served substandard food. I haven’t even mentioned the poor sound, and the fact that another event was booked at 10:30 pm the same night, causing the staff to rush us out of the place.

An evening here can be private and romantic, a casual, fun hangout with friends, or have the feel of a big concert with folks standing or rushing the stage.  Great thing is that you are in charge of the type of experience you want. We ordered 3 bottles of wine and ate chicken wings.  I personally ate the jerk wings and they were very good.  My friends devoured the hot wings, so I assume they were good also. I really liked the acoustics.  We sat down front and did not get blown away from the sound. Minuses are the location of the bathroom and coat check, both inconveniently downstairs.  Also, you practically have to get there and be the first in line to get choice seats, which is 2 hrs before show time. However, we danced to dj'd music, ate, and drank until show time.

I had not been to the Natural History Museum in years, and the new dinosaur exhibit did not disappoint.  I had read about the woman in Montana who had discovered the t-rex’s bones on her ranch in 1998.  I can’t recall who she contacted, but the bones were excavated to reveal the only complete t-rex skeleton.  It is truly amazing that these huge animals roamed the earth some 67 million years ago....I swear that its head was as large as my five foot tall body.  The whole skeleton was some 40 feet long.  Of course, there are other cool fossils in the room, so look around and try to imagine what the earth was like then.  We left the dinosaur exhibit, and watched some great and informative videos, like the one about reintroducing oysters to New York harbor.  We also saw the Hope Diamond, which is like 43 karats.

"Nearly hidden from view on the path from the Korean War Memorial to the Jefferson Memorial, lies a small tree covered spot with a life-size bronze statue seated upon a bench. At first glance, it appears almost whimsical, much like the modern statuary popping up in parks around the country. I urge you to approach this gentleman, read the tutorials, and develop an appreciation for his great contributions to our country. We are all keenly aware that Thomas Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. Many are aware that James Madison was the principle author of the Constitution. This man, George Mason, bears credit for the Bill of Rights, though was long denied attribution because of his failure to support the new constitution due to its failure to forbid slavery. He is a hero, both in his foresight that provided the foundation for the bill of rights, and the early projection of his abolitionist stance.

The bronze statue of him relaxed on the bench is neat as you can sit along side the sculpture of the great Founder.

"Took a campus tour of GW when visiting last Fall 2016. The school is unique in that it has both a somewhat suburban satellite campus (Mt. Vernon) which is more traditional feel and a twenty minute bus ridre from the center of DC, but the main original campus is near the Foggy Bottom Metro and encompasses something like eight to ten city blocks in the heart of the nation's capitol. The main campus of GW has a very different feel from most universities, probably more similar to Boston University or NYU, but being in DC, is going to be unique in many ways. Not sure it's the best for undergraduate school experience, but seems like a great place to be for graduate studies. GW is likely good for a certain type of driven independent student who wants access to internships and living in the city. There is no central cafeteria or dining hall where students meet up to eat their meals. Instead they are given a meal card which is good at dozens of local nearby restaurants, including parts of the nearby Georgetown area. If a student wants to be in DC, the three main schools to consider are Georgetown (extremely difficult to get in and consistently ranked in the top 20), American, and George Washington. All three are private universities and come with a big price tag. Strong students might qualify for some merit awards at American or GW, whereas Georgetown supposedly does not offer merit awards. American is probably the easiest to get into, with GW and Georgetown having a more preppy feel.  AU students that we saw and spoke with seemed slightly more down to earth but it's not good to overgeneralize. Did not do a formal tour of the larger UMD but it's a little far although accessible by metro. AU has a more traditional campus. Although GW has the Mt. Vernon off campus option, reviews seem to indicate it can be a hassle to have to take the bus in and out of the main campus, and probably not as convenient getting to and from internships. GW is a solid school if one is willing to forego some of the traditional campus amenities. Although they did not show the dorms on the tour, they are supposedly very clean, modern and impressive.",November 2016,40,George Washington University,travelfourless,Campus Tour of George Washington University (GW) in DC

"Dumbarton House is a fabulous place.  Given the unlimited supply of places to visit in DC, it may well not make it onto a short-time visitor's list.  I've lived in nearby Maryland for decades and never got there.  But the novel ""Lincoln in the Bardo"" got me to Oak Hill Cemetery, which got me to Dumbarton House.  A nice, if spare, presentation of a solid Federalist house.  If you've seen others, this may not add a lot to your knowledge.  BUT.  And a HUGE but: Dumbarton House is refreshingly honest about its past and its dependence on support from servants, indentured and free, and slaves.  It would be a scandal to try to hide this fact in 2018 and in DC, but other places still do.  So, bravo to the folks at Dumbarton House for including, even featuring, the fact that these rich Brits didn't just float on a magical layer of luxury, but that their comfort was built on the backs of help, free and slave.  And it is clear that as more is learned about those who built and maintained that house, it will be announced honestly and forthrightly.  Frankly, to me, this changed my whole attitude towards the house I was in: the truth was openly, frankly, calmly being told.  There is not a huge amount to see at the house, but because of the honest and intelligent signage, there is a huge amount to be learned, absorbed, in the place that  resulted from the combination of good and bad.  The house embodies the complex relationship between money and labor.  Again, congratulations to the enlightened folks who planned the presentation of the history of this fine house.",July 2018,40,Dumbarton House,Maynard M,Congratulations for your honesty!

"Dumbarton House played an interesting role in our nation's history. It's only one of many stories associated with the Adamesque Federal-style house located at 2715 Q Street Northwest in the historic Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Constructed in 1800, Dumbarton is a significant example of early Federal period architecture that features 18th and 19th century furniture and decorative arts (paintings, textiles, silver and ceramics), made and used during the nation's formative years. It is a large two-story brick house with a passage through the center, four rooms on a floor. The front rooms are 17 feet by18 feet while the back rooms are semicircular and are about 22 feet by 17 feet. The passage is 9 feet wide and 38 feet long. On August 24, 1814, the day the British burned the President's House in the War of 1812, Dolley Madison went to Dumbarton House, then owned by the Madisons' close friend Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, after waiting to be sure Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington was safe, to await further word on where she and her husband, President James Madison, should meet.

I loved that we were able to purchase tickets right there and were able to see the next show that was playing in 15 minutes and did not have to wait long.

I had a stroller with me and liked that I was able to bring the stroller in without any fuss and have it parked next to my chair. I recommend sitting in the back rows because you get the best view!

Open to all, it is a fantastic collection of plants, displayed in boxes and terraces, all of them either seemingly, shade- or halfshade-loving, that owe their existence to the love and dedication of one individual. Also in the middle of its winding self, two small precious examples of wall gardening with succulent plants hanging from wood boards that are are absolutely charming, just above two benches where one can rest and be meditative..

All the plants were neatly labeled and organized in such way that it looks like they're in a natural habitat. The collections of Plants that I've never seen or heard before were there.

Second, we went to hear a show by Storm Large, a singer with the Pink Martini group.  She was doing a Xmas show, so her normally bawdy extremes were toned down quite a bit.  But her vocal range goes well over three octaves (quite amazing).  For a few pieces, she brought a friend, Niki, on stage.  In contrast to Large's yanked-puppet gyrations, Niki was  the perfect vision of serene.  But HER voice was much stronger, and made for the perfect foil when they sang together.

The virtual experiences varied in price, but I think the least expensive was $8 per experience per person.  Of course food and any keepsakes for the trip cost.

The entrance for this is at the corner of 12th and C street look for Wing 2. There should be small red signs on the door that say Visitors Entrance. The security guards are really friendly so if you need help just stop by and ask them. They'll point you to the right entrance. You will need a photo ID: i:e drivers license but it's worth the wait.

This historic canal is beautiful and a fun outing from all the monuments in DC. We rented bikes and rode for 15 miles to beyond the Great Falls which were stunning. We turned around at a park visitor center which had canal boat rides and food available. The locks and the old canal houses were interesting and we saw turtles and birds along the trail.The trail is dirt and is a good track but would probably not be much fun in the rain.

It stretches from Western Maryland to Georgetown with a delightful historical discovery at every point along the way. The locks are fascinating in their attempt to move water to different levels to provide safe passage to boats on their way south. Lock 8 at River Center has boats for rent down along the Potomac throughout the spring, summer and fall. A path borders the canal to allow bikers, walkers and joggers easy passage either north or south.

During my visit they were in the midst of some restoration, which was interesting to experience as well. Our docent was very knowledgeable about the house and its history. The second story circular-shaped room was where James Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812 since he and Dolly had to vacate the White House when the British set it to flames in the same war, and lived here during the reconstruction.

"According to folklore, George Washington and Pierre Charles L'Enfant met at the Old Stone House to plan the design for the layout of the new nation's capital city. It is the reason the house, built in 1765, was never demolished. However, after some research by the National Park Service, it was determined that the legend wasn't true, that Washington and L'Enfant had actually met at nearby Suter's Tavern. Still, the Old Stone House is the oldest standing and unchanged building in Washington, D.C. It also is the city's last pre-Revolutionary Colonial building on its original foundation. Located at 3051 M Street Northwest in the Georgetown neighborhood, it was constructed in three phases during the 18th century and is an example of vernacular architecture. It started as a one-story building and later became a used car dealership. In the 1950s, after a renovation by the National Park Service, it was turned into a house museum. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1967 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Today, the house is 85 percent original to its 18th century construction. The exterior, constructed of blue granite and fieldstone, was quarried from a location two miles away near the Potomac River. The walls range from two to three feet thick. The first floor contains the kitchen, whose hearth is large enough to heat the entire house. The second floor contains the parlor, dining room and bedrooms. A clock in the dining room is the original piece of furniture left in the house. It dates to the early 19th century. The third floor, completed around 1790 and constructed of brick, was a private space for children's bedrooms and a storage area. A closet is attached to a third-floor bedroom, an unusual feature in 18th century colonial homes. A Colonial Revival garden, located behind the house and bordered by a white picket fence, is 399 feet deep and 75 feet wide. It is an extraordinary experience to learn how people lived over 200 years ago.",September 2016,50,Old Stone House,Taylor B,"The oldest standing and unchanged house in Washington, D.C."
"L'Enfant Plaza is conveniently located near the Mall and the Smithsonian, but it is a rather sterile concrete jungle.

"Octagon houses were a unique house style briefly popular in the 1850s. They are characterized by an octagonal (eight-sided) plan and often feature a flat roof and a veranda all around. The most famous Octagon House of all was built between 1798 and 1800 in Washington, D.C. Designed by Dr. William Thornton, the architect of the U.S. Capitol, it is located at 1799 New York Avenue Northwest. It was built for Colonel John Tayloe, whose Mount Airy plantation was located about 100 miles south of Washington in Richmond County, Virginia, and was reputed to be the richest Virginia plantation owner of his time. The three-story brick house combines a circle, two rectangles and a triangle in its brilliant architectural plan, not to mention the Coade stone, stoves, Acquia creek sandstone, imported furniture from England and other unique decorative elements that make the Octagon House a one-of-a-kind residence. It is also famous for two other reasons--it was the temporary ""Executive Mansion"" of President James Madison and his wife Dolley after the White House was  burned by the British in 1814 and Madison used the circular room above entrance as a study, where he signed the Treaty of Ghent to end the War of 1812.",September 2016,50,Octagon Museum,Taylor B,The temporary White House
"Built when the 18th merged into the 19th century, the Octagon House is the oldest still standing in Washington, DC. It housed President and Mrs. Madison during the War of 1812, driven from the White House by the torches of the British. The American Institute of Architects have taken the lead on restoring the house with rooms on three floors available for visitation. Check the guides on individual room doors for a fuller view of each. The Octagon House brings to life the early part of the 19th century with its leisure class supported by a large slave population. The furnishings in each room are limited and marginal so it is a bit disappointing to the visitor who is expecting the fully furnished rooms as seen in Washington's Mount Vernon and the John Carlyle House in Alexandria, VA. Open from 1:00 to 4:00 PM later in the week so check the website for hours.",February 2015,30,Octagon Museum,jeffl499,Beautiful Old House

"The Octagon House is run by an architecture institute, whose modern building is behind the historic house that was built by a Virginia plantation owner when the city was just being established as our nation's capital.  That it has survived pretty much intact with original floors, moldings, staircases, windows, brickwork, etc.,  is amazing, given the multiple occupants and uses, plus moisture issues, after the Tayloe family sold the house.  Besides its age, it is historically significant because this was the temporary home of  the Madisons after the British burned the White House in the War of 1812 and where the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, was signed.  The days and hours that it is open is limited, but if you call ahead, you might be able to get a private tour.

"This tiny Old Stone House is semi-hidden on one of the busiest streets (M Street) in old Georgetown.  I have met a number of public citizen volunteers who maintain the small but lovely flower garden.  Some reenactor volunteers show up from time to time in Colonial costumes to work spinning wheels or to card threads to be used in spinning and weaving.  Other volunteers may do other craft things like carve wooden toys or cook in black iron pots.  It is often not scheduled, but it just happens.  I have also known several Park Rangers and their supervisors who oversee the day to day activities.  If they have been assigned to the Old Stone House for a longer period they may tell you about the ghost voices sometimes heard coming from the empty third floor.  Rangers have reported a man and a woman in argument and a nine or ten year old child also speaking to them.  When the Rangers start to go from the second floor to the third the voices stop.  It is quiet and spooky.  Working on the principle of, “What you don’t know won’t hurt you.” the Rangers avoid telling the volunteers about the ghosts.  So visit and get scared but have fun at the Old Stone House and garden on a beautiful summer day.",April 2015,40,Old Stone House,Hanschen,A QUAINT AND CHARMING PEEK INTO COLONIAL (PRE-AMERICAN REVOLUTION) DAYS

It's a big enough room, and grand enough in its appointments to give you the ""Theater"" experience, but small enough to keep a more intimate experience with the performers than so many of the larger venues.

"Located right next door to Ben's Chili Bowl, the theatre is on U Street with a number of casual bars and eateries in the area. A ""happening"" location on the weekends. This is an older theatre with no 21st century amenities except the hand scanner for the tickets. Most shows are general admission, which means first come first seat selection. Look at your ticket and if it says ""general admission"" and no seat assignment, then, yes, you need to get your own seat. Doors open about 90 minutes before the show starts. If you get there at 30 minutes before start, the choice seats may be gone and yes, you may not all sit together. There is no food served, just popcorn and Lincoln logs, which are a pastry like Ho-Ho's. The popcorn is popped as needed and they can only do 8 bags for every popped session so the line to get it is usually long. I waited 20 minutes for two bags at $4.00 each. There are two bars with beer, mixed drinks and wine. Plan to spend a lot for drinks. I got two glasses of wine for $19.00. Most seats are good. I was not in the balcony but others have said some seats are hard to see from in the balcony. Uber is easy to get when done, as ours was there at the end f the show with no waiting.

The doors were scheduled to open at 7:30, but while waiting in a line that wrapped around the building in freezing weather, the doors were not open until 7:50. The show was scheduled to start at 8 pm. As I write this at 8:17 the show is not started, and there are several people still pouring in to be seated. It would have been nice if the stage manager had done his or her job and cut the meet and greet off in time to open the house. That's a management issue. Wish I could give a better review. For a capacity crowd you'd think they'd do a better job meeting the needs of their customers.

"Any trip to DC is not complete without a tour of the Clara Barton Missing soldiers office. This museum is just a few minute walk north of the mall at 437 7th Street NW. There is a charge, $8, but hearing all the things Clara Barton accomplished is inspiring. The hours are limited, so make sure you check. Currently, they are open Thursday through Saturday, from 11-5. They do offer guided tours that last about 1 hour. Clara gathered and delivered supplies for civil war soldiers, provided first aid to soldiers on the battlefield, After the war, she started the Missing Soldiers Office to help families find their loved ones who had been soldiers.  Last but not least, Clara started the American Red Cross!!! If you want to hear the story of a woman who never took no for an answer, or just to see a beautiful old building, you have to take a tour of the Clara Barton Missing Soldier Office.

There are some artifacts on display - including the innovative pre-printed form that Barton used to respond to inquiries, some personal items found in the attic, etc. - but the limited furniture, although representative of the period, is not original. Frankly, the talk and Q&A with the docent was the best part of the tour.

The pieces themselves are all new or cutting edge.  You will never find this theater performing old chestnuts.  All of the productions are thought-provoking.  Some are entertaining, some funny, some difficult to watch. If you want to see the best experimental theater around, check out Woolly Mammoth!  And it is a rare theater piece that doesn't have some sort of lobby display for the patrons to contemplate beforehand or at intermission.  At many, patrons are asked to vote their opinions (not of the play, but of some political or philosophical viewpoint it examines).  At the last (Civilization: All you can eat), patrons were given the chance to ink a pig stamp on their forehead or strap on a pig nose (i.e. make pigs of themselves) in order to receive a free snack or drink from the theater snack bar.",February 2012,40,Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company,netwinkle,Woolly's plays always provoke

The seats were very comfortable with a lot of leg room.  I would not want to sit in the balcony, appears that the view would not be good from there. The theatre is small, therefore, you are able to hear the performers without any trouble.  The temperature was comfortable, the bathrooms were clean and they had multiple stalls.  They had one white and one red wine, the Cab was very good and reasonably priced at $6.  The performers sang well, however, I was not a fan of the play.  I nodded off a couple of times, awakening at the loud parts.  I am not a fan of the Simpsons, not sure if that put me at a disadvantage.  My husband is a fan but stated he did not feel you had to be a fan and he was not impressed with the play either.

"If you look hard enough and long enough, while visiting the more popular and celebrated of the historic sites and museums in Washington, D.C., you'll come across a hidden gem or two that you never were aware of. The Christian Heurich House Museum is such a place. Located at 1307 New Hampshire Avenue Northwest, in the Dupont Circle neighborhood, it is a Gilded Age mansion that also is known as the Brewmaster's Castle. It was built in 1892-1894 by architect John Granville Meyers for Christian Heurich, a German immigrant and brewer, who created an empire in the capital city. In 1894, he opened his new, fireproof brewery which had a capacity of 500,000 barrels of beer a year and made Heurich the second largest employer in the city, apart from the Federal Government. The brewery, which was located on the Potomac River, is now the site of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Heurich died in 1945 at the age of 102. The first two floors of the house, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, are preserved and include most of the original furnishings. The museum is open to the public Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 11:30 a.m., 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.",September 2016,50,Heurich House Museum,Taylor B,The Brewmaster's Castle

Each kimono has a brief description that leads one to value the fine fabric features and artistry.  There is also a short video on the creation of the kimono art. I liked that the exhibit included the kimonos worn by commoners and that Okinawan kimono style vs Japanese kimono style was explained.  There is a gift shop on the first floor for this donation rather than fee museum  I would recommend checking out the exhibition schedule and a visit here when in DC.",December 2016,40,The George Washington University Museum and The Textile Museum,ArtsyGalBaltimore,The Flair of Okinawan Kimonos

"We've been to the museum previously, before it moved to GWU.  It has a really good collection but only small parts of it are on display at any given time so it is hit and miss as to what you'll see.  The first time we went when it was still in Kalorama Heights, the display included incredible containers to hold packages and mail that were used by Pakastani delivery people.  There were at least a few hundred years old and were amazing.

"I paid to participate in an event at George Washington University's Rafik B Hariri building and although the campus and building are both beautiful, they are not user friendly to new visitors. I had instructions to go to 37th & O streets. My uber driver dropped me off at 20th & H saying that was as far as he was allowed to go on campus. 95 degrees and 90% humidity and I had to walk over 20 blocks to arrive at the sacred 37th & O St. However, the building was not there. So as I was afraid I might pass out from exhaustion, I called the number we were provided and the woman who answered said she thought I had the wrong number. I explained I was exhausted and frustrated and standing at 37th & O and just needed instructions for how to find the right building. She said she could try to transfer me but I would need to provide her with the name of the person on campus who had invited me. I told her I didn't have a name of a person but was there for an event cosponsored by CDFA. She said she couldn't help me if I couldn't provide a name of a person. So...if you don't know where you are and you simply paid a registration fee to attend an event on campus, don't expect help. It won't be there. Maybe if I had actually passed out or had a heart attack, someone on campus would have been willing to help. This was on a Wednesday while classes were in session so it stands to reason the person answering the phone would have had some way to help. The number I called ended in 0100.

Politics aside, here are my favorites:  for the untraditional portraits but I loved them: President Clinton’s was probably my favorite. President Obama’s is VERY colorful and JFK’s was very abstract. Of the traditional portraits, President George W Bush was my favorite followed by President Reagan & President Nixon (painted by Norman Rockwell). The stained glass was absolutely beautiful.

"This museum contains all types of memorabilia from the Bat Mobile to the Stage Coach.  It is a trip through history for all but for me, also a trip down memory lane - not only mine but images shown to me by my mother.  It was great showing my daughter what an old telephone was like or an old washing machine.  The train displays just captivated me, as I grew up across from a railroad yard.  It's amazing to see how things began and developed over the years - the old cars; the styles of clothes worn by our first ladies; fire engines; stoves; and musical instruments; the first Barbie doll; the ruby red slippers; and Kermit the Frog - so much to see.  Plan to go early and take your time.  It's a wonderful collection of our past, present and future and a history lesson that can never be taught in a classroom.

We went to one area we thought would be interesting and there was so little there that I'm not even sure we actually found the exhibit. Maybe it was all behind another door somewhere that didn't have a sign or something. Or maybe there really wasn't much to it. There were a lot of large, wide open areas around some exhibits, while others were crammed into some pretty small rooms.

"We were looking forward very much to visiting this museum, but were left rather dissatisfied by the museum itself and its collection.  First, some positives: there was a very interesting display showing how the evolution of transport influenced the development of towns and cities.  There was also an illuminating history of one early American house, reconstructed within the museum, describing how its occupation had changed over two centuries.  Otherwise, the exhibits seemed to lack a guiding theme and there seemed to be lots of empty floor space and rather poor lighting. One exhibit struck us as particularly inappropriate as soon as we entered, a ""Batmobile"" from the Batman movie occupying a very prominent space on the ground floor.  Likewise, Dorothy's red shoes from The Wizard of Oz seemed another eclectic choice of exhibit.  I also must mention that the museum had the most unsatisfactory and expensive café we have come across in Washington: we paid over $25 for two small, luke-warm and weak cappuccinos in paper cups, two cookies and two over-ripe apples - outrageous!",September 2019,20,National Museum of American History,190Daniel,A rather confused and incomplete perspective on American History

You can see crabs scrambling not to be chosen for your dinner. There are also many counters that have cooked seafood. The jumbo shrimp I got was cooked and delicious, fresh out of the water. There's nowhere to sit but there is a covered area with counters where you can stand and eat. Just be mindful of the pigeons because, yes, that's their mark on the wood where you're eating. Ask for lemon for your fingers if you're getting seafood to eat right away and bring your own wet wipes because there's nowhere to wash your hands when you're done with your delicious seafood.

He gave me almost a dozen crabs and I only ordered and paid  half a dozen. The prices are unbelievably cheap for a fresh seafood. It's a long wait though to have it cooked but it's all worth it.

"One of my favorite places to go in DC for seafood. Its a fresh market but they also have prepped seafood and sandwiches. I always get a big bowl of Maryland Crab soup. Always consistent...chunks of crab meat, piping hot and little bit of spice. I also recommend the clam chowder if you're feeling hearty. And I can never resist the Jumbo shrimp....2 dozen please. For sure this combo always fills me up but I had to get oysters cause they were just staring at me. These were colossal size and shucked right in front of me.

I arrived about a half hour before a scheduled tour so I decided to just walk around myself. A ranger was already giving essentially a mini-tour to a couple so I followed along with them. When I finished I enjoyed it so much that I took the official tour in order to view the upstairs of the house which is only open on the tour. As always NPS rangers are incredibly knowledgeable and can answer all questions as well as giving interesting stories in addition to the history that's presented. It's clear the site has tried to add some fun things for young people such as places around the house that are good for taking a selfie and hashtags to use. Very few people came in and out while I was there so if you want to be very leisurely in your visit there's no rush at all.

"I do favor the large, heroic sculptures of the kind that were often done in the 19th century, and this is one of the best ever(although I understand it was actually done in the beginning of the 20th Century, completed in 1920). In the center is a large equestrian statue of General Grant on his war horse, Cincinnati. At each of the four corners of the platform this monument is sitting on, there are figures of lions, which I suppose are guarding him. To either side of the central statue are separate monuments, each with the most amazing and complex group of action figures; one is depicting a group of cavalry, the other is an artillery group, both have men and horses rushing into battle. The sculptures are cast bronze and the bases are made of Vermont marble. Take the time to visit this memorial and study it, a brilliant work of sculpture. It took the artist 20 years to complete it.

"The Grant memorial, is a statuary ensemble located  at the foot of the west side of the Capitol,.  The central figure is of course Grant himself, mounted on a horse.  Panels on the plinth and flanking free-standing statues show combat scenes.  Unlike the multitude of statues to other Union officers all over Washington, this is not simply a formal representation, but a study in the burdens of command and the nature of war.  Grant is astride  his horse, strong and resolute, but also brooding and thoughtful, and the combat scenes catch some of the chaos of combat.  Grant not (quire) as bad a president as sometimes claimed, but he was a magnificent general, and this memorial displays that side of his career.

The are several vendors that will cook the food and offer side dishes as well.  The food was awesome as we had crab legs, fish, calamari, shrimp and corn on the cob for less than $50.00.  The have an area for you to eat but it's standing room only with wood picnic type table in the middle and bar tops around the perimeter.  The eating area is on the water but it is open air so the are bird and other insects around.  The service was pretty good just remember that they are cooking the food you purchased so it can take a few minutes. If you want fresh seafood that tastes good, try this out!

Good consistecy, think potatoes are frozen because they have a funny consistency. Crabcakes were actually okay- filled with crab rather than tons of bread, Got a full ear of corn, and decent coleslaw. I think each dish needed seasoning to make it good. Just a little  more attention to detail would help. I saw more people in line at Jessies but no place to eat.  The disproportionate line at Jessies might mean better flavor.

The garden is very nicely designed to educate visitors about plants that attract butterflies, especially in urban areas.

We thoroughly enjoyed the Washington Ballet’s performance of the Nutcracker in this beautiful theater. Parking is nearby in various garages for different prices. We paid $12 which was very reasonable. We did note that our garage closed at 11 p.m. The theater did have security and checked my purse as we entered. There were items for sale as we entered and both floors had snacks and a bar. The seats could have been more comfortable but the show was excellent and the costuming was exceptional. Leaving the venue was easy because they opened the side doors of the theater.,December 2017,40,Warner Theatre,Melaney68,A beautiful theater and parking was easy

"While waiting in line to see the New African American History and Culture Museum. I craved a cup of coffee. Looked around for a Vender but found none had what I desired. A Museum Security Guard informed me that their was a Food court at the Ronald Reagan building about a block or so from the Museum. Upon entering the  building we were Checked by building Security ( a sad state of what it like these days ). But I was on the coffee hunt. In the basement of the Ronald Reagan/ International trade Ctr. My quest was ended with a steaming cup of coffee and a scrambled egg sandwish on wheet toast.

"I was looking for a place to park for a few hours on a Saturday while I took my children to the National Mall. I researched a lot of places and narrowed it down to here or Union Station. I chose this as the first place to try because of the security, reviews, and location. We arrived around 10:30 am. The security guards at the entrance were very friendly.  At first I thought we would never find a spot, but as we made it down to B-2 there were a ton of spots. I found a great spot near the elevator that seemed wider than other spots (3 spots between 2 columns). We went to the food court b/c the kids were hungry and at this point it was around 11am so I decided we should grab something quick before it got crowded. In the area we sat and ate there were only two other tables occupied. Nothing like what I had read in other reviews (maybe because it was a weekend?).  We went back down to the car to grab a drink from our cooler and all the spots within site were already filled. The bathrooms were clean. When you get off on the ground floor there is an information desk with a friendly gentleman that can provide you with a DC map. The walk to the mall was very easy. Upon our return we grabbed a smoothie at the food court (still not crowded), used the clean restrooms, and made an easy exit (no waiting).",August 2017,50,Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center,melee,Perfect Parking and Friendly Staff/Security

"The Ronald Reagan Building is very conveniently located to the White House Visitor Center, as well as to all the monuments on the National Mall and to the Smithsonian Museums...just a couple to a few blocks of walking gets you right to all the action.  It worked great to use the Parking Panda app to pre-pay for a parking space, even at busy times. The parking spaces are under the building, and be prepared for the attendants to check your vehicle to make sure it is safe, then for each person to go metal detectors and for security to check your bags (whether you enter in a car or on foot).  Everyone was very efficient and professional at this, so it didn't take too long.  Just above the parking decks is a large food court. There were ten of us eating lunch there, and between us we had chinese, japanese, greek, and american food.  :)  Prices were comparative to being in the city (i.e., pricy compared to a small town but not awful).  On the street-level floor, there were concierge desks and these folks had free maps and were great at giving directions.  Also, throughout the facility were many clean restrooms and even some souvenir shops.  Since the building is named for Ronald Reagan, there were several nice displays honoring him and on the second floor, there is even an authentic piece of the Berlin Wall.  The building also has flags of many nations on display to highlight international trade.

"We were there as a tour group Saturday of Memorial Day weekend.  Normally, the building is closed on weekends, but because of the holiday this was an exception.  The building is a blend of private and public occupants.  It's a federal office building and uncharacteristically open to the public; you must pass through security.  The atrium is beautiful.  With 7,000 employees, it must be bustling during the week, but it's very quiet on these rare weekend openings; just tourists.  There was a high school band playing on the atrium stage when we were there; the performance was really good, so that was a treat.  There is a food court, but we didn't eat there.  There are also souvenir gift shops in the atrium area.  There is a Woodrow Wilson foundation organization there, but it's closed on the weekend; which is odd--at least on the weekends the building is open, you'd think the foundation would have at least some hours open to see the exhibits and information.  This building doesn't have an exhibition on Ronald Reagan; just some quotes on the wall and a few likenesses.  There is a piece of the Berlin Wall by the entrance, and over by the Homeland Security entrance is a piece of the World Trade Center from 911.

The staff was very courteous and helpful. What might be the best thing about the entire place in my opinion however is how easy it was to find. Nothing is better than being able to drive straight into D.C. without the need to catch a metro with little complications and no worries whatsoever with finding where a building is. GPS has helped us tremendously but a well-lit, extravagant, and easy to find building always is appreciated. There was even a convenient parking garage directly across the street so there wasn't even any hassle there. Will definitely visit again.",April 2015,50,Warner Theatre,Patrick M,Beautiful Venue
"Went to see Memphis here because I was offered discount seats. We usually go to Baltimore or Philadelphia being my preference. I was impressed. The seats are set up so there really isn't a bad seat in the house, the warm roasted nuts alone are worth going to a show for, the only thing that wasn't impressive were the resturants that were walking distance from the theater.

The Petersen House provided excellent detail into the aftermath of the Lincoln shooting. The house has a museum which goes into detail on the events leading up to the shooting and timeline. An exact replica of the bed in the room where Lincoln died is also on display. The original bed is in the Chicago area. The bedroom where he died has been reproduced to what it looked like at the time. This is also true of the rest of the home. Admission comes with your ticket to Ford's Theater. ,August 2015,50,Petersen Boarding House,Skimanski,Great Display of American History 
We visited the house after going to Ford's Theater. We viewed that museum & then listened to the Ranger talk. Afterwards we walked over to the house using the same ticket and viewed the house. The main floor entrance and the top floor were the highlights. The other floors were Lincoln tributes but didn't need much time. It was amazing to see the tower of books that has been written about Lincoln. ,July 2015,50,Petersen Boarding House,Melanie R,Great visit along with Ford's Theater

"The place is absolutely HUGE and the layout and signage is baffling. The event I attended used most of the space and the dining area was closed. Instead they had carts set up in different areas selling overpriced, poor quality food. Coffee was hideous. You are much better off taking a little walk at lunch to a nearby neighborhood. If you walk a few blocks down 7th street toward Chinatown there are many places to choose from. Also, there are a couple of Starbucks in close proximity. Three good things: plenty of bathrooms that were kept clean and stocked; you can get a bit of exercise walking up stairs and around the center to combat days of sitting in conferences; and an easy taxi stand with many cabs on Mt.

The building is beautiful and cast. The parking is terrible and there are barely any signs for parking. The service by employees is mediocre at best. They don't serve coffee until 8am and thankfully there was a Starbucks in the next door Marriott. The folks who worked the convention were nice but the food options are not good and the cost is ridiculous. A water cost 4 dollars?! Just terrible. The food was not good for the convention at the cost. It was an overall okay experience but not great. Our booth was also having an issue with tv so I went to the help services and they said they couldn't help and I needed to go to a phone and dial 0 which led me to a number stating the office hours were not in window for help even though they were.

I got free parking when I received the tickets which was nice since it's right under the theater. I believe that the VIP Suites are held by season ticket holders and they resell their tickets to the events they're not interested in.  The value added is that a cocktail waitress will come to your seat and there's a small table where you can set your drink and other belongings.   The Warner Theatre is easy to get to and although restaurant choices are a bit limited, you can't go wrong with Chef  Geoff's which is right across the street.  Couldn't be more convenient!

For me this was not an ordinary trip to a museum, at several times looking at the exhibits I was almost moved to tears. I can't remember being so emotionally overcome at a museum since I visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.

The pulpit in the larger chapel beautifully recreates the cave from which Jesus rose on Easter with the relief of three women walking away from his cracked-open tomb.

The same reserved ticket will admit you to the Petersen Boarding House, where Lincoln was taken (across the street) after he was shot. Be aware that there are long lines for admittance, and on a hot day there is very little shade so you will want to bring a bottled water to drink while waiting. Once inside, you will take a small self-guided tour of each  of the rooms that are accessible on the ground floor to the public. The tour highlight is the actual room where Lincoln passed away, including a replica of the bed. The house is attached to the overall Ford Theatre visitor center, which is a multi-level complex with  modern amenities. In addition to the nice exhibits spanning several floors, there are very clean unisex restrooms on the second and third level. There are interactive exhibits for children or young adults to partake in, with thoughtful questions and activities to leave a response. There is a very nice book sculpture centerpiece in  the center of the stairway, and a gift shop on the ground floor.

"I've actually not been inside. So I can't attest to the awesomeness of that; however, for 5 years, I worked right around the corner and found myself in awe anytime I was able to sneak a peek. The building is absolutely stunning. It's also supposedly haunted (as I learned on a ghost tour of dc - 2nd date with my now husband).

That said, as good as that exhibit was, the Chapels on the first floor and the permanent St. John Paul II exhibit on the lower level about his life - from his birth to his death and EVERYTHING in between - was absolutely extraordinary and spiritually rejuvenating...especially in this day and age!!

"I had not visited the Shrine in several years, but wanted to see the special exhibit on St. Thomas More (which ends March 31).  First of all this special exhibit (on the second floor) was extremely well prepared: first, a number of significant period-items (books, pictures, religious items, even one of More's hats, etc.) which were briefly but interestingly described; second, there were wall-scrolls providing interesting information about the More's life and times.   The main floor has a large church and a smaller chapel: both have significant mosaics done in a bright modern style (which may be a bit too bold for some).  The new permanent exhibit on the life of Pope-Saint John Paul II on the lowest floor is also a vast improvement over the previous exhibit: both more extensive and with better historical material.  There is parking behind the Shrine as well as on Harewood Road in front of the Shrine. ",March 2017,50,Saint John Paul II National Shrine,John T F,Renovated Pilgrimage Site

There are several floors but only two or three contain Lincoln memorabilia such as stirrups from a funeral horse. The rest contain activities pertaining to history and leadership.

It's best seen at twilight or even night because some features are lighted nearby: the bridge, benches, the waterfall, etc. We had dinner at Agua 301 (which overlooks the splash park) and then played at the park until after dark.

You can't go inside so don't waste much time here when there are so many other worthwhile things to do in Washington.

"I had never had a tour of the State Department so I added this to the list. I was hoping for learning more about the work of the State Department and seeing those kinds of things, similar to a Pentagon tour I had received in the past. The tour was almost exclusively showing us the reception rooms and the expensive antiques and art in their collection. I didn't even get to see Secretary Clinton's private server where all her emails were deleted! It wasn't worth the time spent in security.

"I discovered this gem only recently.  The inside is very different from the outside.  Inside it is all wood in supposedly Tudor style.  It also houses a theater in the style of the Globe theater where plays were staged during the time of Shakespeare.  Free, highly informative, guided tours are available.  Lot of interesting, rare, and one of a kind pieces in the collection.  A peek at the magnificent research room elicits expressions of ""Wow?""  The place is a premier center for doing scholarly enquiry and research on anything related to William Shakespeare.  In the long, high ceiling vestibule connecting the two ends of the building, there is often an exhibition mounted related to Shakespeare.  When I was there, the presentation was about Churchill drawing on the Bard's plays and oratory to inform his own rhetoric.  There are also copies of original folios and other fascinating artifacts on display too.  As is only to be expected, the replica of the Globe theater stages plays.  Not a Broadway show at all, instead it is an intimate setting, cosy and small with players all around, on the stage in front, in the galleries above and around the audience.  I watched King John (the monarch associated with the Magna Carta) -- it was well done and engaging.  I bought the ticket at the box office; discounts available.  You can buy on-line and in advance.  The Folger Library also has a small gift shop with many items sporting a Shakespearana theme.  Highly recommended for English literature and Shakespeare buffs.  The library tour and the exhibits are free.  The plays -- you have to buy a ticket.  Very close to the Supreme Court and the Capital Building.

"The second time my wife and I visited Washington, D.C., we stayed at the Hay-Adams Hotel at 16th and H Streets, directly across ""the park"" from the White House. ""The park"" is Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House on H Street between 15th and 17th Streets. Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, it was established in 1804 and named for the Marquis de Lafayette, a French general who was a hero of the American Revolution. Until recently, I always thought the huge equestrian statue in the middle of the park was Lafayette. No, it is Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States, which was erected in 1853. Whose statues are situated on the four corners of the square? Lafayette and three other Revolutionary War heroes, Tadeusz Kosciuszko of Poland, Baron Frederich Wilhelm von Steuben of Prussia and Comte Jean de Rochambeau of France. Curiously, the square has been used as a racetrack, graveyard, zoo, slave market, campsite for soldiers in the War of 1812 and many political protests and celebrations, even an 1859 duel between a future Civil War general, who killed a man who was having an affair with his wife. Over the years, the park has served as a picturesque background for many motion pictures. On a sunny day, it is a wonderful place to sit and soak up the scenery along Pennsylvania Avenue.

It has two things going for it--there's a Metro stop next to it that is handy for visiting mid-downtown and on some Fridays in warm months, there's a good farmer's market in the plaza next to the building and plenty of places to sit and enjoy a pick-up lunch from the venders at the market.",December 2018,30,Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center,BlueNWashington,Truly one of the most uninteresting buildings in Washington

Love going to The National Theatre during their Broadway Series. They offer a lottery for most shoes in the Broadway Series. We have gotten lucky and received orchestra seats for $25 each (cash) during the lottery! Great way to see more shows without breaking the bank. The theatre is intimate and sound for our shoes this year was fantastic!  We also learned tonight that they offer The Morning Show throughout the year on Saturday and kids are free. Performances are at 9:30am and 11am. Reservations are required. I can’t wait to bring my friends’ kids!  ,December 2019,50,The National Theatre,JDDenver,Theatre

Lots of kids playing in the water feature (I don't know what to call it, it is too big to be a fountain, not really a pond, whatever!)  Caution, the deck around it can be very slippery when wet!  We figured that out the hard way.  Bring swimwear for the kids if they are coming here.  There is no way they are not going in there when they see all of the other kids in there!  There was probably about 75 kids in the water we were there mid-week.  Most seemed somewhat supervised.  After ""the fall"" my kids didn't really want to walk around much, so we just grabbed some ice cream and headed out.

Both are a wonderful tribute to those troops. The museum is as others suggest not huge or overwhelming yet chock-full of interesting and oft-times moving information and displays. While I was there a docent gave an informative and emotional talk that was great. Do not miss the memorial -- it's across the street from the entrance to the museum.

"The museum is wonderful and you should go.  That takes care of that.  But the web site is confusing and I intend to give you the real skinny.  If you want to browse the art on your own, at your leisure, you MUST go on Friday-Saturday.  If you go during the week when reservations are required, there are several things the web site doesn't make clear.  First of all, you can't arrive more than 30 minutes in advance of your ""tour"".  The web site merely says ""Reservations required for 10:30 a.m. or 1:30 p.m. guided tour"".  You can't come too early and you can't stay late.  I had someone picking me up and I was kind of booted out the door (because everyone had left) before they arrived.  They don't let you know that fact on the website.  Photographs are OK, but no flash.  No photographs are allowed on special exhibits.  If you come during the week for a tour, you can NOT go off on your own--you must stay in the same room as the docent.  So if you can't get your picture taking or your perusal of the paintings done before the group leaves the room, you are out of luck!!  The web site doesn't say that, either.  You have very little freedom of movement.  Had I known these things, I'd have postponed my visit until Friday or Saturday.  That would have given me the chance to spend some time in front of the more interesting paintings, something I had no time to do on Wednesday.

Its collection is arranged in three galleries: ""Military Medicine,"" ""Anatomy and Pathology,"" and ""The Collection that Teaches.""  The most significant artifacts are in ""The Collection that Teaches"" gallery.  The bullet that killed President Lincoln is certainly the most historically important item on display.  Arranged next to the bullet are fragments of Lincoln's skull, the bloody cuffs of the Army surgeon who performed the autopsy, and a lock of hair from Lincoln's skull.  Also on display are numerous bones and organs from Civil War-era figures including Captain Henry Wirz -- the commandant of the Andersonville POW camp who was executed for war crimes in 1865 -- and Daniel Sickles, the controversial Union major general whose right leg was amputated after being struck by a cannonball during the Battle of Gettysburg.

At the museum, the Civil War story is placed in the context of the slavery before and the Civil Rights movement after.  The displays aren’t fancy, but it’s well done.

While small, the museum offers some exhibits you will see NOWHERE else (and its free).

Also here are several vertebra of President James Garfield that were penetrated during his assassination.

"Stuck out in the suburbs (although there is a reason as visitors will learn) north of Washington, this very small museum is filled with interesting medical instruments and preserved medical specimens from throughout American history. For those interested in presidential history, there's the bullet that killed Lincoln and the vertebrae from Garfield showing the bullet damage and evidence of the infection that finally killed him. The autopsy instruments used to identify John Paul Jones after his preserved body was  found in France sit next to instruments used in autopsies of 9/11 victims from the Pentagon. But, the heart of the collection is a remarkable array of specimens from wounded soldiers from the Civil War - only a small fraction of these are on display, but they tell some awful tales of pain and suffering that these men went through. For example, there's a tremendous display on facial reconstruction of wounded soldiers from the Civil War through to the most recent conflict and another on the growing sophistication in prosthetic limbs over the years.

Our family saw most of the Broadway plays during the 1970s to mid 1980s.  When I saw Pippin was coming to DC this year and the fact it won Tony Awards, I had to go.  The actors were superb and includes Lucie Arnaz (daughter of comedians Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz).  I had not seen her in years and remember her from The Lucy Show in the early 1970s.  Lucie Arnaz was amazing in her role, in Pippin, especially the acrobat moves she did (she is probably in her mid 60s now).  The other actors were also awesome with their acting and acrobat moves.  I had heard parts of the show will remind you of Cirque de Soleil and it does.  I had not been to The National Theater since the late 1990s and well remember going to see various plays back in the day there.  The theater is still maintained nicely and they do have an elevator which goes to the very top for balcony seats,  You can obtain tickets, from their box office, without paying the service fees  (which is a plus).  You can also order tickets online or via phone but service fees will apply.  Ticket, for this play, were reasonably priced for a Broadway production.  There are a couple of Metro subway stations nearby for convenience.  This is a better option than parking because the garages are expensive and street parking is metered and scarce, usually.  There are also many restaurants & hotels within walking distance or a short subway ride away.",December 2014,50,The National Theatre,Lady4Evermore,Enjoyed Awewsome Play (Pippin) At This Theater
"Now, the only reason this theater is not getting five stars is... yes, the bathrooms.  Okay they are clean but to have ONLY four stalls per level of the theater for the women's bathroom is absurd.  The lines to use the facilities was across the back lobby area and it took the entire intermission and then some to finally get to use them.  In this day and age, when women actually go to the theater and not just men, this must be changed.",January 2015,40,The National Theatre,drlynnrose,An old but stately theater

"Easily overlooked, this small museum in upper Georgetown has a world-class eclectic mix of modern art, African art, Impressionists, sculpture, and folk art.

"I decided to come here to both study the architecture and experience the art. I was satisfied on both accounts. Not being an art major, I wanted to take one of the tours, as I tend to find art museums are hard to appreciate without a guide or strong personal knowledge of art. The staff was incredibly friendly. The tour guide even talked in depth about the architecture for me upon learning I was an architecture graduate student. Normal admission is $10 I believe, but discounts (such as a student discount) are available (I think I only had to pay $7.) I'm excited to see how the sculpture garden project their working on comes out. The only downside for fellow tourists is that it's a bit away from the rest of the tourist attractions, and a ways away from the metro lines. You'll want to take the buses, and maybe wear light trail walking shoes so that you can take a short cut through Glover Archbold Park if you're coming from the red line. Overall you'll burn extra time getting there, but I destination is worth it.",December 2013,50,The Kreeger Museum,ErikFess,My new favorite art museum
The museum is fairly low budget. It basically consists of storyboards arranged in partly chronological and partly topical order. Consider it an introduction to a neglected part of Civil War history. I hope it will inspire you to read more deeply about the role of US Colored Troops Regiments and naval volunteers as well.. There is valor to be celebrated and acknowledged.

"The selections that evening included chicken which had been swimming around in an unpleasant looking liquid in the steam table, beef stew which seemed an odd menu item in Washington’s midsummer 96 degree at 5:30 in the afternoon weather and a vegetarian stuffed pepper.  There was also a salad which would have probably been the safest choice.  My husband chose the chicken and I went with the pepper.  Both were served with mixed vegetables which looked to be straight out of the grocers frozen food section and boiled potatoes.  Neither entree was even passably appealing and were abandoned after several bites. I could go on but you get the idea.

"The Kreegers were amazing to have amassed such an impressive art collection.  This museum is actually the former home of the Kreegers, built to accommodate their minimalist/modernistic lifestyle along with their precious paintings and sculptures.  When you arrive, be sure to stop in the 'coat room' to read the background of the Kreegers.  Then go on to stroll the two floors of the building for an intimate glimpse of works by Picasso, Monet, Chegall, Cezanne, etc.  To be so close to this artwork is amazing.  I was drawn to this museum after learning of the special exhibit by Emilie Brzenzinski with her works of wood.  The entire lower level was devoted to her large and impressive wood 'sculptures'.  This is here for a limited time only, and I suspect it will be replaced by another interesting exhibit.  The museum is small and leaves you wanting for more.  Luckily, there is more.  Allot at least a half hour more to stroll the grounds (5 acres) and enjoy an interesting variety of sculptures, a fountain/pool, etc.  Note about the tour... I did not take the free tour which lasts about an hour.  If you are patient, by all means take it in.  In my case, I have a short attention span so was happy to hear snippets of information while freely roaming the area nearby.",November 2014,40,The Kreeger Museum,travelingfun101,Class act

"I found this wonderful museum from reading reviews on things to do near Bethesda Maryland on TripAdvisor. This is a small museum, which I have learned the hard way, it’s quite nice. It is much easier to learn more from Les then to try to learn a little bit from too much! The museum explains its origins, beginning with the Civil War  but also has information from World War I as well as medical advancements more recently. There are examples of injuries to bones from soldiers, information on medical equipment since the Civil War, the bullet that killed Abraham Lincoln as well as the bullet that killed James Garfield and  prosthetics since the Civil War. There are also other interesting informational displays on other diseases and treatments. Allow one and a half–two hours to get there. The museum is in a quiet neighborhood and is definitely a change of pace from the busy mall area of Washington DC.  We were staying in Bethesda Maryland and I ended up taking an Uber to the museum. It took 10 minutes. The metro and bus ride would have taken me over an hour.

Visited Washington DC last week. Went to couple of museum and other routine places. My daughter wanted to go to Artechouse. This is a combining Art and technology. Cool things they have done by giving digital experience. Lot of Immersion videos (Augmented reality / Interactive videos). By season the exhibits vary. When we went it was spring / blooming season. So there were flowers and you could immerse into blooming flowers and made it interesting. It is a good change compared to regular museums,April 2019,40,Artechouse,Murugasamy L,Different experience from going to museums
"It was an easy walk from the National Mall to the Artechouse. Amazing experience!! Interactive digital art in several different rooms. Their staff was available in each area to help everyone. Big beanbag chairs in the large, main room were available to sit and enjoy the experience while listening to relaxing music.  You can stay as long as you want. One room had an improved interactive experience if you download the app and look for tags hidden around the room.  They have an after-hours experience for people 21 and older, but their daytime hours are open to all ages. Very cool!",April 2019,50,Artechouse,JB_from_NE,Unique experience close to National Mall

"The majority of the exhibits just weren't that interesting.  After a few minutes, you get the point.  But having visited all the other museums over the years in DC, we thought we'd give this a shot. We enjoyed getting a cocktail at the bar the most.  The drinks were fun and tasty and the use of the AR technology at the bar was really cool.  On the plus side, staff make efforts to keep the space from getting overcrowded.",April 2019,30,Artechouse,Leftmid9,....well the bar was cool.
"Challenges. 1) Value is tough - price is high for what only took us 30 minutes to tour. 2) VR Technology only works with some smart phones. 3) Location - of the beaten track in DC - it is not really near many of the other DC attractions. Not far from the Wharf - but the walk is through underpasses, not a fun scenic walk.",May 2019,30,Artechouse,dagsmith,Technology and Art - But is it enough for the value?

The arch is pretty. That's about the only positive thing I experienced about Chinatown. The one Chinese restaurant I went to - Tony Cheng - was dumpy and not tasty. Everything felt generally old and dirty. The whole place is full of homeless and mentally ill people wandering the sidewalks - I didn't feel unsafe the entire time but it really doesn't *add* to the appeal of the place. I won't hurry to go back but will stay in the area again if I have to.,April 2019,30,Chinatown,GravesAR,Not interested in going back
"So much to do for blocks,  no car needed everything is in walking distance and have shuttle to shopping outlet mall from hotel. Many different food places,  bars and stores all within same block.  Early morning exercisers or cartoon on big screen in the National Harbor yard at the pier. New MGM Grand Casino being built near by National Harbor by the end of year 2016 if you like to gamble.

I’ve gone on girls night, date night and taken the kids. Each time was fun especially the date night and the girls night. I only experience one problem during this current exhibit. The iPhone was not working on the augmented reality and that was a problem for me. I plan to write a letter to the corporation about this because even if it’s Apple fault Artechouse should be offering the guest some sort of do over if they can’t capture the full experience while we’re there.

"Artechouse (Art+Tech+House) is a unique showcase for experiencing digital art and new media in DC. We try to visit whenever they announce a new installation and have been to nearly every one since they opened in 2017. Artechouse specializes in innovative, interactive, and immersive exhibits. The main gallery provides a giant, high-ceilinged, 270-degree canvas for displaying large-scale digital projections across the walls or for multiple interactive elements within the room. Motion and sound sensors are often used so visitors can interact with the art. Off the main gallery are two smaller side galleries and a short passageway that permit additional viewing or interactions with smaller installations or elements. Some of these smaller elements have included VR (virtual reality). Artechouse does have an app that can add to one's experience, depending on the installation. We have enjoyed some installations more than others; they are not always even or of the same caliber in terms of aesthetics or experience (for our tastes), but every exhibit clearly displays the artists' talents in the digital media. As with other art exhibits, everyone does not appreciate all the same art. It is important to read the exhibit descriptions and FAQs carefully before purchasing tickets. (Also, some exhibits may not be appropriate for all visitors since the exhibits may have sight or sound elements that would be problematic for certain conditions.)  The Artechouse staff has been unfailingly courteous, enthusiastic, and helpful. We have enjoyed every visit to Artechouse, and even when one particular exhibit has not been as good as another, we have never been truly disappointed but remain glad that such a venue is here in DC.",March 2019,50,Artechouse,Jack B,Unique Digital Art Experiences

"I travel a lot and come to DC frequently. I try to check out Artechouse every few mos b/c they change their theme a few times a year. Relatively cheap, though it is a fast experience. You walk through an open room with projectors playing some kind of cool art. There are about 20 beanbags for people to hang out. There are two smaller rooms, one on each side, that have another kind of art on display. They are relatively small areas, but it provides the chance to walk around a bit. Getting a pic can be hard b/c there are always people in your shot, but it is a nice 'instagram spot'.",January 2019,50,Artechouse,FirstClass2018,very cool spot to visit
"Group size was just right  - not too big.  There was enough variety in the exhibits to enjoy for 40 minutes  - perfect for young children.  The Cherry Blossom festival themes were varied and done beautifully.   Was great without the AR ap - but could see adults were having fun with AR ap ..  We were mesmerized by the tumbling blossoms, the blue lit room with ocean theme, and enjoyed the Japanese shadows area,   Be sure to get tickets in advance - they sell out quickly.

"The area is a rather small. historic borough east of downtown consisting of, what I could see about one or two handful ethnic Chinese and other Asian restaurants and small businesses situated along H and I Streets between 5th and 8th Streets. More or less the neighborhood is now just sports bars, chains, and trendy restaurants. I think the demographic has also changed drastically. More or lest just another street with office buildings and flats. One of the most clean, nice China towns I've ever been to. Not the most authentic! I will say if you've been other Chinatown, this will leave you underwhelmed. If you haven't, it'll still leave you underwhelmed.

There are fun things for kids to do as well I saw some venture into the fountain for splash fun, feeding the ducks or walking to the nearby monuments.

"No matter the season, this delightful little piece of Georgetown waterfront, replete with restaurants and an ice cream parlor, delights. In the summer, private yachts and the commercial water taxis add to an already quaint outdoor centerpiece of a large fountain in the middle of the complex. In the winter, you can ice skate on the fountain or witness revelers enjoying the skating (sometimes falling - :-)).  There are several restaurants.  The most beautiful is Tony & Joes, but the food is so-so. Overall, for food, I'd recommend Farmers, Fishers, Bakers. They're the most consistent. The others are touristy.

There's a major fountain in the center of the open air plaza, which gives entertaining illuminated water shows every half hour or so at many times of the year.

"First of all, they say on their website that there a 2 types of shows, one with children and one for adults only. They don’t tell you that both shows are exactly the same. That is very deceiving. Second, the room where the show is going on is not fit for the type of display, there are 2 large doorways that make giant holes in the display and the wall corners should have been rounded (easy enough with ¼ inch dry wall, really) because the display jumps and distorts over the corners. Also I don’t know what the employees are supposed to do, but it would have been nice if they could have said a word to the few obnoxious people who thought that it was ok to stand right in the middle of the display and have their (and each one of their party) pictures taken, over, over and over again.

The large room, the small room (which had columns of light) off to the right, a hallway, and the back room. This artist seemed to use interactivity a lot more than some of the previous artists. We spend about 45 minutes here which was enough. It would probably be an interesting place to come and have drinks (there was a bar in the back of the large room).

My friend hadn't enough battery, but the real problem was he paid for data and just couldn't afford it.  Arethouse isn't well marked.  They have not obtained a permit yet to have their name printed on the blue awing.  Pot Belly is well marked.  It is next to this sandwich shop chain.  The world famous Mandarin Oriental hotel shares the cud-e-sac with the art light encounter.  We enjoyed our adventure, but it wasn't memorable.  It could have provided more variety on the interactive table instead of repeating the same boring image.  We did love taking our pictures with a marching Nutcracker.

"We didn't do a guided tour, but instead got a map and walked around on our own.  I wish we had done the tour.  This place is breathtaking.  I don't even think that adequately describes it.  There is SO much to see and learn about.  We spent a solid two hours here and honestly could have spent more time just sitting and taking in the peaceful, spiritual atmosphere.  We did not even have a chance to see the gardens.  There is also a Lego project going on--they are building a scaled size Cathedral.  It is unreal--the volunteers there were kind enough to spend quite a bit of time with my sons explaining the project, and even let them build a piece of it.  Of all the things we saw while in Washington (we saw A LOT) this ended up being one of our favorites.  Highly recommend.",June 2019,50,Washington National Cathedral,nikkic990,A MUST SEE

I'd say a group of 30 or so were enjoying - I came in late - but it looked fun and spoke with the prepares afterwards.  Did a garden tour of the Regional Garden. (In the fall many plants are winding down for the season - so it is pretty brown.)  Docent was really nice and learned a lot about the region.  Plantings on the lawn were in transition, with new fall/ winter gardening in progress.  The roses were really happy with the cooler weather.  This was my second visit, with the other being in April, so it looked much different.  In April the inside of the building was nicer than this time.  Maybe, next time I'll be there in the summer!

"It’s big - but that’s it. There’s very little detail. Compared to a mediaeval European cathedral, the stonework (or is it concrete?) looks prefabricated, there’s no intricacy in the design, and the stained glass (or are they plastic?) is crude. I was also really saddened by the standard of the cathedral choir when I heard it - well below what I am used to hearing from cathedral choirs in England (and indeed St Thomas Fifth Avenue NYC). It is a mile away from anywhere, in the middle of a purely residential (and very rich) neighbourhood, and I would not bother going out of your way either to visit or to worship.

Fun long walk to see many of the unique Embassies. Depending on how far of a walk you want to take and which Embassy you want to see is where you want to start. If you are up for a long walk starting at the British Embassy on Mass Ave and walking down to Scott Circle is about 1.5 miles. It's a shady walk and it was one of my teenage daughter's favorite things we did while in DC. ,July 2016,50,Embassy Row,robspald,Worth the long walk
"I actually lived just down from embassy and usually after a lazy Sunday brunch, I would either meander down that way. Sometimes, actually usually I was accompanied by a companion and we would stroll around the various Embassy houses, remarking and laughing that we were probably being watched. Most times if there were someone outdoors they would give us a friendly wave from behind the gates. Most of the houses are quite spectacular the roads are tree lined with  a bit of cobblestone here and there. I do recommend this as a nice digestive walk with some nice views.

They have working periscopes, a mock-up of the interior of a wooden warship, and all kinds of other cool things.  Lots of history from the Revolutionary war to today.

"Tried to visit this museum during a recent visit to Washington - knowing it was on a active base, did some homework and checked their website a couple weeks before coming. The ""how to visit"" information there is generally out of date (I later found out), but there's fortunately a toll number to call and leave a message. I called and got a message back a few days later that said getting on base to see the museum was not a problem for those with a DOD ID, but even for regular folks all one had to do is stop by the security office at the 11th and O St gate for a pass. So, went there while in DC this week and stood in line for 45 minutes (be advised that this office is mainly there to serve military personal, civilian DOD employees, and contractors to get badges and parking stickers, so serving tourists definitely isn't their thing - indeed got the impression that that was the last thing on their minds), only to be told when finally at the head of the line that I needed to fill out a multipage form (what is your supervisor's phone number was one of the questions - obviously this form is not designed for someone who's trying to visit a supposedly public museum, but whatever) which is something that phone message neglected to mention. It isn't obvious what you are supposed to do after filling out the form - no one seemed interested in answering questions, so presumably you have to go back to the end of the line and wait for another 45 minutes (probably longer as the line had grown a bit) to turn it in. Of course, this is just the start of the process. The form is needed so they can now run a background check on you - again not mentioned in their phone message. It is unclear if this will be done while you wait and how long it will take - but even if they do it while you wait, bet it takes another hour or more since they are also processing all of these other higher priority badge and parking sticker applications these other people are there for, so you'd be waiting 2 or 3 hours total and you haven't even gotten inside the gate, assuming you pass. I gave up after the first hour or so of waiting, so can't report on whether the museum is worth any of this. Actually, I did visit it about a decade ago when access to the base was much, much simpler - the museum then was okay, but certainly not worth a two plus hour wait. As a taxpayer, I have to wonder if this museum is a good investment of my money - it might be a good retention tool perhaps, but certainly isn't going to tell the average taxpayer much if they can't get in to see it easily (compare this to the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson for example) and presumably the same can be said about kids who might be future recruits if they again can't get in to see it either.",December 2015,10,National Museum of the United States Navy,interceptpubs,"Unless you have a DOD ID, don't bother"
"Question: Who was the only American President to select Washington, D.C., to be his home following his final term in office, after he left the White House? Answer: Woodrow Wilson. Located at 2340 South Street Northwest, just off Washington's Embassy Row, not far from DuPont Circle, the house was built in 1915. The 28th President and his wife moved into the Georgia-style, three-story, red brick home on Inauguration Day in 1921. Wilson made several modifications to the house, including a billiard room, stacks for his library of over 8,000 books and a one-story brick garage. It was from the balcony of the house that Wilson addressed a crowd on November 11, 1923, as his last public appearance. Partially paralyzed from a stroke he suffered in 1919, Wilson spent his few remaining years in partial seclusion at the house under the continuous care of his wife and servants. On February 3, 1924, he died in the upstairs bedroom and was buried in Washington National Cathedral. His wife continued to live in the residence until her death in 1961. She hosted then First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy for a brunch in the formal dining room The property and all of its original furnishings, portraits, books, a Gobelin tapestry, commemorative china and autographed photographs of people identified with events in Wilson's administration were bequeathed to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The house has been added to the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. It is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.",September 2016,50,The President Woodrow Wilson House,Taylor B,An overlooked house--and an overlooked President

I am SO glad we went! I honestly did not know much about Woodrow Wilson before this trip so it was nice that they played the informational video before the tour. Our tour guide was very knowledgable and answered any questions we had. She said that overall the articles in the house are about 80% original. Basically, Woodrow Wilson's wife preserved the entire house almost exactly the way it was when he died, knowing she would have it donated for public tours. I thought one of the neatest artifacts was the pen he used to sign the declaration of war in WWI.

I see no point in going to see the embassy flags and staff:  it is the architecture that shines here.

"After being swept along with the crowds down at the Smithsonian Mall during spring break week, two adults and one 12 year old boy thoroughly enjoyed exploring this fascinating museum almost totally on our own.  The exhibits are thorough and filled with artifacts.  I concentrated on a few areas because the amount of information is overwhelming; I look forward to returning to concentrate on other areas.  The 12 year old enjoyed the provided scavenger hunt and climbing upon on the gun turret of the US Constitution.  There are so many different kinds of exhibits that people with all different kinds of interests can find something to learn whether it be weaponry, weather, history or even fashion.  The visit to the USS Barry was also delightful as we climbed up and down narrow stairways, roamed through the mess hall and bunks.  An added plus for us was the riverside walk to Nationals Stadium where we had tickets for a late afternoon game.  This was definitely a high point of our week long discovery of Washington DC.  Be sure to bring identification as you are on the Navy Base  so you need to go through clearance just inside the gates.",March 2012,50,National Museum of the United States Navy,kassie59,"Underappreciated, hidden gem"
"What a COOL museum!  If you love history, you'll love this museum!  It is laid out chronologically through the wars and advancements in technology.  There is also a really cool exhibit on the Homefront which is very well done.  They have TONS of posters and other primary sources so this is great for field trips or an educational outing.  There were curators of the museum there when I was there and they stopped to talk with me on several occasions (probably because I was the dork reading EVERYTHING!) and when I asked a question about the medals the service members earned, they disappered and came back out with a full blown chart of all the medals for the various branches ... REALLY COOL!!  Don't miss this museum!  They also have a number of items that you CAN climb on - take pictures from etc. so it's great for all ages!

"We recently visited the Navy Museum, located near the new baseball park in DC. We went with two children, aged five and ten. This museum is located in a secure area, so you must obtain permission on base which requires vehicle registration and proof of insurance. Adults must have ID such as driver's license. Permission is given at Bldg 126, just inside the gate. Once you have the proper paperwork, you are given a map and instruction on where to park. The museum is set up chronologically, so start at the front door and work your way back. There are great displays following naval history, which some hands-on items such as submarine controls and deck guns. Overhead are Navy fighter planes and a couple of Japanese suicide planes that obviously never completed their missions. As expected the main focus is WW2, where there were a tremendous amount of Naval engagements. Two other items I particularly enjoyed where the Houdin bust of John Paul Jones, and the chair that Lincoln used while waiting for telegraphed news from his Generals at the Naval Telegraph Office across the street from the White House during the Civil War. Farthest back in the museum are the deep sea craft Alvin and Trieste. The museum is a real treasure that you could easily spend a whole day going through all the displays, if so inclined. Outside across the street are displays of naval weapons, including a WW1 railgun, and a 16"" gun barrel. On the water you may also visit the destroyer USS Barry, which was closed the day we visited (9-11-2012). NOTE: there is another museum near Pennsylvania Ave that has some Navy displays, plus a really good film (at least there was years ago when I last visited), but is not the same museum. The museum I've reviewed today is in the Washington Navy Yard.",September 2012,50,National Museum of the United States Navy,nancysid,"A little tough to get into, but way worth it!"

There are actually two museums.  One is the Navy History and the other is the Cold War Museum.

"The only U.S. President who remained residing in Washington D.C. After his term in office.  A look back at American upper-middle class living in the 1920s.  Getting there is not a simple matter.  Two options.  Drive there and look for parking (good luck).  Use the Metro, then walk.  Take the Metro to the DuPont Circle station.  Walk west on Q Street to Massachusetts Avenue (Embassy Row).  Walk NW on Massachusetts past the embassies of Turkmenistan, Greece, then going past Sheridan Circle, and continuing up past the embassies of Haiti and Croatia to 24th Street NW.  Turn right up this street (this is actually cutting through a 'short-cut' to S Street.  At S Street, turn right and the house will be a few doors down on your right.  Open 10 am to 4 pm.  Admission $15 per adult.  You will first see a 10 minute 'overview film' on Wilson's life and times.  Docents will then lead you through a 40-50 minute tour of his home, viewing the Foyer, Parlour, Dining Room, Den (dugout), Breakfast Room overlooking the garden, Kitchen and Bedrooms.  The guides have many stories and excellent historical knowledge.  No matter how you feel about this President (and even if you don't think you feel anything about him, you should - because it was he who instituted the Income Tax) this hidden jewel is worth the walk up and the walk back to DuPont Circle.

"I bought a Groupon for a reduced admission for two people and was very pleased with my choice.  The Wilson home is part of the Dupont-Kalorama Museums Consortium.  We were there on a Wednesday and were fortunate to snag a parking place in front of the entrance to the home and a tour by a docent as soon as we entered the home.  Visitors are shown a video of the life and times of Wilson and then taken on a tour of the Wilson home.  The home of the 28th President of the United States is a definite “must see” during your visit to Washington DC.  The home contains the original furnishings of the home and the objects, gifts of state, and original artworks.  The guided tour includes the public rooms such as Wilson’s secretary’s office, the room where Wilson gave his radio speeches which also housed his library of books, the solarium where he shared his meals with his wife, and the servants’ kitchen.  We also saw the bedrooms of the president and his second wife.  Wilson is known as the first President to visit the Pope in the Vatican and his League of Nations was the precursor to the United Nations.  After his Presidency, Wilson lived in this home until he passed away.  In fact, he chose to have his viewing at this home in front of the painting of the Madonna and child.

"Read on to simplify weekend access to this fine museum! First, this applies only to those who have a ""CAC"" card, i.e. military or DOD employees.  ONLY the 11th Street gate is open on weekends - and beware this is eleven blocks east and two blocks south  from the Metro stop. Supposedly CAC cards should work in the card readers at other pedestrian gates if you scan X2 separated by several minutes...mine didn't. The museum is indeed open on weekends though the USS Barry is permanently closed and will be scuttled soon. The museum itself is great and has one-of-a-kind displays, with surprising hands-on stuff. Who doesn't want to flip the switches and turn the dials on a sub control panel? There is much on subs, diving, arctic exploration, and the Pacific theatre of WWII; the displays have little duplication with the Annapolis USNA museum.  Shame on the Navy, though - it's inexcusable that the website doesn't give access info, and that no one answers the phone. I'd given up trying to get in when I ran across some Navy officers who gave me the correct access info. Bottom line: worth the effort, open on weekends, and a long walk from the Metro.

"Knowing we wanted to visit this museum on our trip to DC we checked out what we needed to do ahead of our visit.

It took about 10 minutes (maybe less) to complete the forms. We waited another 10 minutes to be called up after having our information checked over and a background check run. they asked us a couple of questions, gave us a visitors pass and we left the Navy Yard. We went about our day and about 1 pm we were able to walk on with our Day Pass and Drivers License to get on base. The kids are young teens, so they did not need vetted or ID. We enjoyed a leisurely afternoon of touring the museum and seeing some of the other maritime treasures on the Navy Yard.

A vast chamber of beautiful columns, gilding and skylights, it hosts nine exhibitions and some extra on the history of the building as the original Civil War Pensioner building and a small bakery. I enjoyed the exhibit on the planned communities surrounding US development of nuclear weapons, the modular interiors exhibit (future of US housing) and a general exhibit on American housing. I had hoped for a larger exhibit on the history of architecture and engineering in the US, including the migration and evolution of building styles and design over the years. What they had was informative but didn't feel comprehensive for America's history of structure and design -- at least, not in my mind.

"We were there on what had to be one of the hottest and most humid evenings of the year (as much water as you wanted was readily available). We'd received our tickets several months in advance but the seat was not reserved. It was recommended that we arrive no later than 7:45 as the general public would then be invited in. We arrived by 7:15 and were surprised at how tightly packed we were in the stands. As the performance was not to start until 8:45 it was not easy to sit comfortably until that time. We are in our mid-60's and with my husband's back issues he walked around until it was almost time to start. I, of course, had to stay to keep our seats. The program itself was very impressive as the darkness of the night and the use of spotlighting enhanced the performance. Watching the precision team was fascinating. However, I would not recommend this for young families. Instead I would recommend going to see essentially the same program performed close to the Iwo Jima memorial on Tuesday evenings. It's called the sunset parade. I don't believe advance tickets can be ordered as there is no general seating for the public. People brought blankets or stood. This way our children could move around and not be restricted. It's easy to get to via the Rosslyn Metro Station. I should say my husband is a Marine Veteran so I admit I am biased. But for anyone who enjoys music and who wants to see dedicated military I'd put either of these performance on my list of things to see while in D.C, Oh, the Marine Barracks is easy to get to as well, just get off the Metro at Eastern Market.

"Maybe it was because we had just seen the Masonic Temple in Philadelphia but this temple was just okay. The architecture was nice but the rooms weren't decorated as grandly as the temple in Philly. We had to wait a long time for our tour which also kind of ruined the visit for me. It wasn't as if the place was busy, the tour guides were just sitting at the desk gossiping. After about half an hour we watched a video then the tour got started. Our tour guides must have been new because they basically read off a script. There are some interesting displays which I think is worth seeing. However I think this place may have more value as a self guided tour accompanied by a recording rather than utilizing the tour guides. Also parking is very difficult to find. The temple has a good sized parking lot in the back which they won't allow you to park in as it is reserved for employees only. When I went the parking lot was completely empty except for 2 cars.

The outside vendors along 7th Street sold craft type wares. I was most impressed by one vendor who created art using a sewing machine. This is definitely the place to be on Saturday and Sunday.

However, other than that the lack of hygiene along with the hot and sultry weather made our visit here rather unpleasant and gross  The selections and stands were rather small in number as well and I found myself being ready to leave after less than an hour after my arrival.

The different rooms were quite something with how they were built and I don't believe they could be duplicated today.  One thing I would bring a water bottle and dress lightly for it is warm in some of the rooms are don't have AC.

Frankly, the museum at the Naval Academy is as good, if not better, in terms of telling the story of the Navy and has as good, if again not better, collection of artifacts on display. The staff here also seemed to be pretty disinterested - when we were in the gift shop for example, the guy working the counter didn't even stir from listening to his ipod or whatever to see if we were finding what we were looking for. You'll have to answer for yourself the question posed in the title of this review - for many people, we suspect they'd learn just as much and be more inspired even by heading over to Annapolis and seeing the museum on the campus there and just walking around surrounded by the next generation of naval officers being trained to go in harm's way.",June 2019,40,National Museum of the United States Navy,interceptpubs,"Interesting museum of USN history, but is it worth the hassle to get in to see it?"

I wasn't expecting this memorial as I came out of the Archive metro station. At first it seemed like a simple fountain but as I looked more I noticed the prominent lone sailor sculpture with his marine bag.

I did not enjoy this.  Not because the Navy isn't important but because the people who organized this don't seem to understand the importance of the Navy.

The centerpiece is a statue of a sailor, one of several placed in various cities. It's a homecoming statue - he's not dressed for a parade, but truly looks like a worn sailor who's returning home. I don't know that I'd go out of my way to see this, unless you have a special interest in the U.S. Navy, but if you're eating at Hill Country Barbeque, look it up on your smart phone.

Like a lot of such places now, they charge high fees for the privilege of standing on a cement floor and even higher fees for the limited seating up top and by the sound board.

There are plenty of places to eat and grab drinks nearby, so do that before and/or after.  Note that the bars inside here don't take cash, but the merchandise sellers do.

Third, walking out on the boardwalks to the marshes was both enjoyable and peaceful, offering a place to sit and simply observe what nature has provided. How cool is that?

"My brother and I visited DC for a weekend. We decided to take the Metro on Saturday thinking it would be better than driving into town and trying to find a place to park. The fare on the Metro from our location was $3.05 each way, so we figured $6.10 for the round trip, right? Wrong. We had to purchase a metro card from a machine for $2 and a minimum of $8 had to be loaded on it. The card machine is a bit confusing, but a nice employee at the East Fall Church station (Mr. DuBose?) was very helpful. The next day, Sunday, we decided to drive into town and park on the street rather than take the Metro. So in essence, a one day round trip to DC on the Metro ended up costing $10 instead of $6.10  We still have $1.90 remaining on the card which we will likely never use again.  I wonder how many others have unused amounts on their Metro cards? Otherwise, it is a nice system and a convenient way to get into DC.",June 2019,30,Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro),MrDonaldK,"Convenient, but costly for a one day visit"

The variety presented is phenomenal, from super-size blossoms the size of a child's head to small blossoms that dazzle with color.

There were a few parking areas around the garden, but there was a long sweltering walk between the parking areas and the park itself. The shuttle buses were packed and moving very slowly on the hour. It would have made it easier if there were more shuttle buses running every 15-30 minutes. The metro station (Minnesota Ave) is the closest to the park.

The brass fixtures were tarnished and in need of polishing, the woodwork in the elevators needed re-finishing, the marble on the stairs was suffering from benign neglect.

"So I have to say that living in Chicago we have lots of experience traveling on subways and Elevated track systems.  We had just come from Boston and had a very good experience with their public transit system.  We lucked out a bit because we left DC on the same day that major track lines were scheduled to be shut down for a long period of time for repairs.  We found the system easy to navigate, really reasonably priced (We got a one day pass $14.75 for the two full days we were there).  You pay for the distance you ride and have to scan you card before going to the platforms and then again when you arrive at your destination.  Compared to Chicago's CTA and Boston's system the stations and cars are so much nicer.  We were mostly traveling after the regular commuters were riding so we didn't have to deal with large crowds. The Metro (when not under renovation) is a great way for confident tourists to get anywhere in the city.  We took it to and from the airport, to Arlington Cemetery, Eastern Market, the Riverfront area on a Friday night (lots of fun!), Smithsonian, Fords Theater and the Capitol Building.

Walking through the gardens was a serene departure from an otherwise hectic, fast paced trip to Washington D.C.

"Part of the DC experience is walking around and viewing the countless buildings, monuments, squares, statues and public spaces.  But if you need to get somewhere quickly....or, in my case, if it starts to rain...this is the way to go.  The ticket purchasing process is about the same as in most other cities...purchase a card, put some fare on it, add as you go.  So if you're used to that, it's status quo.  If it is your first time, it may be a bit intimidating at first.  But take your time and you'll figure it out.  Once through the turnstile, signs are somewhat small, so check the pillars for a listing of stops that the next train will be making.  And stay on the correct side of the platform.  Most stations are open and almost airy, especially the ones that have connecting trains.  Lots of up and down balcony type things.  Cars are clean, quiet and efficient, with an overall smooth ride.

A succession of ponds filled to the brim with water plants and a lively ecosystem that begins with very clear water over the naturally (and needed) muddy bottom, populated with a myriad of tiny fish, bullfrogs (we wandered if there was a donkey around), herons (a reclusive tiny grey and a splendid blue), insects feeding on the flowers and of course the flowers. Wide extensions of lotus (three different colors) and water lilies of multiple types are dotted on the edges by orange milkweed, buttonbush, cattails, prickerelweed and more water-loving plants in a natural landscape that literally takes your breath away. Everything if left natural (this is not a municipal garden, beware!), but the paths are well-tended, dry and easily workable with simple sneakers. Easily reachable by car, by bicycle and at three blocks from the Deanwood Metro Station, this place will offer a glimpse of DC, at many levels, that goes well beyond the ordinary and should not be missed.",June 2017,50,Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens,944giorgiog,A hidden jewel in DC

"We've visited the Hirshhorn 4 to 5 times over 20+ years and it was always a favorite in DC. What a huge disappointment to visit the other day and discover they no longer display their stellar permanent collection! What happened? Now, with the exception of the outdoor sculpture garden, which remains the delight it always was with Moore, Rodin and other giants of modern sculpture, they've given over the ENTIRE museum to a selection of special exhibits, most of them of dubious artistic value. Obviously, introducing new forms of art is important, and tastes do differ, but I've yet to visit another museum that doesn't balance experimentation with its heritage and strengths. Here, they've given over the entire building to experimentation and our group, including an art historian and teacher, was not impressed. Perhaps this decision accounts for why this museum ranks pretty low among its Smithsonian brethren. It's a shame that a once excellent museum has gone this route. I was particularly disappointed that I gave two hours to this place which left me insufficient time at the National Portrait Gallery which is a FAR better museum.  Lesson learned for next visit to DC.",December 2018,20,Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden,luxlovernyc,A former favorite has lost its way....
"You could skip all the exhibits and you didn't miss much.  ""Pulse"" exhibit and downstairs exhibit maybe.  Bring back the permanent collections.  You need to balance it out.  The museum thinks it is ahead of a time with all these experimental exhibits only.  There are almost no ""normal or traditional"" modern arts (yes, there are some) to compare with these interactive exhibits at this museum unlike American Art Museum. I'm all for new and alternative arts, but you have to remember those wonderful alternative arts were built on the basis of traditional foundation. Nothing against the artists at the museum.  Some are very nice and well-thought out.  It is the overall presentation and direction this museum is heading that I was disappointed.

We saw a week long pass for 17.50. It stated it was for bus/rail in which case we assumed rail meant subway. As we tried to get through the turnstile, it kept rejecting us. People were angry and trying to get around us ""tourons"". We then went to the booth to figure out why our passes weren't working. MS. Cosby came out of the booth and kindly let us know we bought a bus pass. She gave us a form to bring to their main office when it opens tomorrow. She then brought us through the subway system and brought us to our stop which was an amazing Nationals game! She then gave us info on how to get back and let the ticket booth know to let us through when the game is out because we paid already. I seriously can't remember having better service anywhere.

In one installation, you can provide a picture of your finger that is included in a collage of multi-finger prints.  At the same time, your pulse rate is measured.  Another installation uses the pulse of your finger and hand prints to create ripples in the water surface that is projected as a wall mirror.  The third installation uses the pulse in your hands to generate an electric pulse in a light bulb which is added to a series of other pulses.

"Kenilworth Park & Aquatic Gardens in Washington, DC is a great “find” and is the only National Park dedicated to waterlilies, lotus plants and other aquatic plants. The park is located on a bank of the Anacostia River and offers a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.  At the Visitors Center, you can obtain a brochure describing the various ponds, view a small display of the history of the park and aquatic plants, and purchase items at the small gift shop.  In the largest Lotus pond is the Sacred Asian Lotus, a beautiful pink-colored flower.  Other ponds have the native yellow Lotus, white water lilies and a pale pink with yellow ting lotus named after the founder’s (Walter Shaw) daughter.  The boardwalk ends in a cul-de-sac and affords the visitor an opportunity to see the marshes as well as how much tides change the water level.  As you walk through the many paths, you will come upon areas where beavers eroded the dirt by crossing from one pond to another.  Bicycle enthusiasts and hikers can use the Anacosta River Trail, a .7 mile path.  Guided tours are offered at 9 AM and 1:30 PM.  My recommendation is to go during the week when it is less crowded so you can thoroughly enjoy the beauty of this park.

"The Metro offers a visitor convenience and access to all those monuments and museums and off the beaten path gardens and nooks. Slap a credit card into a machine at any Metro station and you have your ride. Hmm. There are quirks. For example, we told the designated Metro employee at our station that we had 3 days to explore the city. He recommended a 3 day pass @$28+$2. Logical. However, this isn't Disney World. We had Friday, Monday, and Tuesday due to prior commitments. Alas, passes are for consecutive days. Ours expired without a whimper. Come Monday we decided to register our cards, a good thing, and load $20 on them for Monday's and Tuesday's adventures. But no. If you load money on your card from home, thinking you'll save a bit of time, you need to understand that the money will disappear from your bank or credit account immediately, but the Metro doesn't apply it to your card for at least 24 hours.

"The National Museum of Women in the Arts is completely fabulous! They have a unique mission, as the only major museum in the world totally dedicated to exhibiting art by women. And they carry through on that mission in a dazzling manner! During my November visit I experienced three breathtaking exhibitions. On the ground floor “Women Artists of the Dutch Golden Age”, a stunning jewel box of a show, featuring names to conjure with: Judith Leyster, Clara Peeters, Rachel Ruysch, Maria Sibylla Merian, Maria Schalken, Anna Maria van Schurman, and Alida Withoos. Stunningly displayed against Bold magenta walls, the works positively glow, and make a strong case for the talent and commercial success these artists enjoyed in their times. On the second floor another stunner, Contemporary artist Janaina Tschape’s fantastical “100 Little Deaths” exhibited together for the first time - yes, all 100 of them! The curation is fabulous, and against dark grey walls the large scale photographs are illuminated. This is just the first incredible room of NMWA’s “Live Dangerously” exhibition, which also showcases work by such stars as Rania Matar, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Graciela Iturbide, Ana Mendieta, and more. Finally an astonishing exhibition of new work by legend Judy Chicago, a deeply moving series examining “The End” with Chicago’s signature honesty.

Opinions were divided on the Judy Chicago exhibit, which focuses on themes of death and extinction and features work that is much darker than her earlier pieces.

"In DC for a 5-day visit in June 2018, I decided to revisit this museum after about 10 years.  It is as charming as ever - small, well done.  Two special exhibitions drew my eye: art of the Swahili cultures, and a short independent film focusing on the shores of West Africa and Brazil.  The Swahili show is small and exquisite, with many objects drawing upon the local culture in which they were made but with motifs or craftsmanship that indicate the influence of an international artistic tradition from the Indian coast through Egypt and down to Kenya.  The film too is exquisite - slow paced, images of nature sometimes adorned with yards and yards of flapping fabric that reminded me of Christo.  I felt transported to another world, the more so since the gallery where the film is shown was quiet, with few viewers.

We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of Tudor Place.  You could tell the guide was passionate about the home and its history.  I was amazed at all the original pieces and treasures throughout the home that was passed on to each generation and also new things added showing the different time periods.  I especially liked seeing the closet full of beautiful dresses owned by the last family member.  This house is very quiet and off the beaten path in a lovely Georgetown neighborhood.  The tour is about one hour and you can have a look around in the garden for about 15 minutes.  I was able to call this morning and put our names down for the afternoon tour.

"There is a wealth of pedigree associated with Tudor Place, a grand Federal-style mansion located at 1644 31st Street Northwest on the Georgetown Heights in Washington, D.C., with a marvelous view of the Potomac River. It was originally the home of Thomas Peter and his wife, Martha Parke Custis Peter, a granddaughter of Martha Washington. Step-grandfather George Washington left her $8,000 in his will that was used to purchase the 5.5-acre property that would become Tudor Place in 1805. The Marquis de Lafayette visited Tudor Place. So did Robert E. Lee. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The temple-like porch and supporting columns provide a most striking addition to the front. The gardens and the historic house museum's collections are as rich and as interesting as the house itself. A focal point is a collection of over 100 objects that belonged to George and Martha Washington, making Tudor Place the largest public depository of objects belonging to the first Presidential family outside of Mount Vernon. Tudor House, with 180 years of Peter family ownership, offers a rare glimpse into American cultural and social history.",September 2016,50,Tudor Place,Taylor B,See the grand collection of George and Martha Washington artifacts

"I try to visit as many historic homes as I can during my travels. This one was one of the best in terms of seeing a home that is very authentic. Now, that needs some explanation: the home remained in the Peter family from 1816 to 1983. As descendants of Martha Custis Washington, they were acutely aware that their home was a living museum and they cared for it and its Washington-connected artifacts as if they always knew that some day the house would be open to the public. Most of the house looks just as it did when the last Peter resident used it. Only the kitchen has been restored to the period it would have looked when ""updated"" in 1914. The docent was very knowledgeable and encouraged questions. The exterior gardens were also fantastic. These were also planned by the Peter family over the last two centuries, so one really sees a home as its early residents would have seen it.

Unlike any museum of it's kind I've experienced, it is very much worth the time to go through the house with one of the docents.

"I've lived in Washington, DC, for seven years, and this was my first visit to Tudor Place.  It's a hidden gem in the Georgetown neighborhood, and ideal place to visit for any history buff.  The home built in the early 19th century for the granddaughter of George Washington, it stayed in the family - and was occupied - until the mid-20th century.  This means that the home is incredibly well preserved.  Anyone with an interest in architecture or American history will love seeing the building, the beautiful antique furnishings, and the lovely gardens.  My favorite items were the clothes hanging in one of the bedroom closets - actual dresses and coats from one of the previous residents, just gorgeous items from the early 20th century.  Our tour was very small (about six people), and the guide took her time showing us the home.  In fact, the tour was a big too long ... we had to leave just before she was finished in order to make our brunch reservations. Allow for at least two hours to see the gardens and take the tour.  The $10 cost was worth it, even with so many free attractions in DC.  If you want to go off the beaten path and see something that isn't overrun with tourists, head to Tudor Place.

"Shortly after eating lunch at the cafe in the Smithsonian Castle, I walked out into the garden to enjoy the sunshine before my next scheduled photoshoot and spied the National Museum of African Art (not to be confused with the National Museum of African American History and Culture).  I had not planned to stop there but couldn't pass it up since it was so close.  The building was not overly large but upon entering I was immediately captivated by an early to mid-20th century funerary sculpture of a powerful male warrior from Madagascar which was donated to the museum by The Walt Disney Company.  The galleries to the right of the sculpture appeared to be featuring more modern art which is not really my favorite but the galleries on the left offered a variety of historical pieces that included some intricate 18th-19th century Benin bronzes as well as more modern bronze sculptures such as a 1984 portrait of an ideal Benin woman by Nigerian Osaize Omodamwen.

"Tourists, be fore-warned: worship is the top priority.  There are fascinating tours offered by exceptionally knowledgeable guides, but they work around the very frequently offered masses.  Schedule a time when you can visit the catacombs, the purgatory altar and most especially the tomb of the resurrection.  These are very faithful reproductions of Holy Land sites... and everything is beautiful.  But they aren't just knock-offs; they serve the same spiritual purpose as the originals.  The catacombs even include the remains of an actual persecution-era saint.",October 2019,50,Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land,Daniel M,"Worship given higher priority than site-seeing, but still unmissable."

"This tasteful memorial portrays the job of law enforcement officers as akin to that of  lionesses looking after their cubs - hence the paired statues that flank the name-bearing stone slabs.  If the designers wanted to go a step further they might emulate other memorials that include searchable registers of the dead, such as the one at the Border Patrol Museum in El Paso or the many World War I and II cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission headquartered in London.  Otherwise it's hard to tell exactly how the officers met their deaths and this encourages all sorts of often erroneous notions.

Anthem says all the views are good and this is true.  Pretty much everything is general admission except for some seats. Behind the seats are two standing areas that are general admission.

"We saw Ben Platt there last night (a Saturday), and this was our first time to the Anthem.  Everything was VERY well run. They had a general line to start with (short, moved quickly, and was very well controlled by a staff person sending people on to the next step in waves), then sent you to a staff person at the doors to get your tickets scanned. This all moved very quickly...we were in the building in 5 minutes or less. Bag inspection and ID inspection took some time, but it wasn’t too long of a wait...maybe 10 minutes or so to get through both. Bars and restrooms were easy to get to. Seats were well laid-out (we had assigned seats on the floor, and the chairs were comfy)...a little tightly packed, but we could see well and were on an end, easy in/out for us. Acoustics/sound and lighting were outstanding! We FELT the music, and everything was so clear! Last, but not least, I need to mention the staff. EVERYONE was professional and friendly...ticket scanners, ID/bag checkers, bartenders...all were smiling and welcoming. I would visit the Anthem again. Parking was a challenge, even with a reservation, but it worked out, and is not part of the venue itself, so no points off. Just be aware if you go, I reserved on a parking app and couldn’t find a spot. The parking attendant finally guided me toward a curb (not an actual spot)in the garage where I wasn’t blocking anyone and told me to leave it there. Worked for me! The Anthem itself was outstanding!",May 2019,50,Anthem,LJ Z,Excellent Venue
"My hubby and I saw Kenny Chesney at the Anthem last night. The concert was incredible but this review is for the venue. This was our first time there so we went into this pretty clueless but our goal as we get older is to try new things and get out of our comfort zone! The Anthem is is an awesome area called The Wharf with lots of bars and restaurants but NO parking. You have to park in a garage and it's highway robbery. We had GA tickets which means that you stand for the entire show. We found an awesome spot on the 2nd floor to watch from and camped out there. By the end of the evening I was really wishing that we had paid the price for their ""super excellent seats""! That's a silly name but is what the Anthem calls their available seating. Just a few more thoughts; It struck me immediately how great their staff was. Every interaction I had throughout the evening was super. Kudos to the bar staff for mixing great drinks and not trying to rip people off. Not only were the drinks good and strong but were also fairly priced. The acoustics are above average but not as good on the sides as they are in front of the stage. Finally, it got too warm in there quickly and they really needed to get some air circulating. With a few tweaks I would have given The Anthem a 5 star rating but definitely look forward go back. We are seeing Peter Frampton there in September, still general admission but am sure to enjoy. Will keep my fingers crossed about winning those super excellent seats!",April 2019,40,Anthem,Cosmic5,Fantastic Venue

"I'm from a smaller town and not used to riding a metro/subway system, so was a little intimidated by the Metro.

"Everyone that we encountered was super nice and polite with one exception; when I was exiting the bathroom, a tall, scary and very angry looking female purposely strode in and glared at me but hard. The restroom police? Trust me, I wasn't doing anything wrong! I had to walk around her to get to the door. And about the bathroom, it was massive and clean but I couldn't get any faucet (the kind with no handles) in there to turn on. A bit of a nuisance, but I used some hand sanitizer that I always have with me. Also, exiting the venue was not fun. There were people scattering in every possible direction and two young men banged right into me because they were in such a hurry to get to the $40 t-shirt table. Also, as others have noted, the convenient below ground parking garage is a half block off the street and if you blink you'll miss the turn to get to it. And, having to stand in another line to wait for one of three parking ticket payment machines was a pain. Then, having to get in another line with all of the other cars, all merging from several directions in order to get into another line to finally exit...and the parking fee last night was $35! A complete ripoff.. I liked the venue, the sound systems, the light shows, the seats and the performances, but honestly, the rest stank. And, make SURE that you eat before you go or you'll pay a pretty penny for some very mediocre food. Just a word to the wise.",May 2019,40,Anthem,travelkitty50,Our First Concert Visit

"Visited the Anthem for the first time for Beck last night.  I must agree with the other reviews that call into question the sound quality of this venue.  It's a good LOOKING room, spacious, nice amenities, courteous staff - lot's of positives about the facility.  But the sound quality, in a word, sucks.  We were on the third level for Kimbra - the warm up act - couldn't understand a word either said or sung during her entire set.  We were stageside stage left for Beck, and while the sound was a little better, it was still distinctly muddy. The reason is that a majority of the interior surfaces are concrete and all that does is just bounce sound around the room. There are no sound baffles in the ceiling or enough seating to effectively dampen the reflective nature of music like you would find in a theater designed for these sorts of performances.  So while I enjoyed the show, I won't be going out of my to go back, there are much better places to see a show.",April 2018,30,Anthem,Craig G,Needed to hire an Acoustical Engineer

The Anthem does offer free wifi, but so many people are on there that the connection was so slow I couldn't connect at all. As a result, I wasn't able to meet up with many of my friends at the show. The lack of service also results in extreme difficulty to call an uber/lyft/cab after the show.

And finally designers who understand: the woman’s room was huge so there were no lines there either. (We didn’t use it but there was a very long line at coat check.)

"We used the DC circulator the entire weekend and it was easy to navigate, cheap, and very helpful. If you get a SMART card at the Metro you can pay $1 and get two hours of usage on the buses.  They are clean and the bus drivers are helpful.  My only complaint is we rode the yellow line in to Union Station to catch the red line around the National Mall on Saturday and the red line was shut down until noon beaches of races.  That is find, they can't drive around when roads are shut down but there was no mention of the closure on the website or on the App.  We ended up riding the metro instead to get closer to the National Mall but if we had know it was closed we wouldn't have gotten on the yellow line we would have just used the metro that morning.  App is helpful but not great.  Would definitely use this again the next time we are in DC.",October 2018,40,DC Circulator,Sarah L,Great value
"We enjoyed using DC Circulator during our recent trip to Washington, DC. Our group included three seniors and we got a senior discount (regular fare $1.00/ senior fare $.50) each time we hopped on the bus. We saved money versus buying a Hop-on-Hop Off bus ticket. I would recommend this inexpensive mode of transportation for getting around the DC  National Mall.",September 2018,50,DC Circulator,Mary H,Inexpensive Way to get around DC National Mall
"It seemed so many people were not aware of this bus service.  It will save your feet!  The DC Circulator Bus has four different routes, but of course the best one is the route around the ""Mall"" and all of the Memorials.   It only costs a dollar each time you get on:  BUT:   If you have the DC Smartrip card (which you should order on-line in advance - but you can also purchase in any Metro station)  you pay $1.00 to get on and then if you return to the bus within 2 hours, they don't even charge you again.  What a deal!!  The card is pre-charged with funds and can be used on the subway, city buses and the Circulator.

"We had a tour scheduled for 9 AM, we arrived early and they would not allow us to enter the building for our tour due to my 17 year old son did not have a ID.  He has not yet received his drivers license so he does not have a ID at this time.  We had no issues on all our other tours, even The Pentagon did not require an ID for someone under the age of 18.  The FBI needs to allow persons under 18 to enter without an ID.  We were really disappointed that we were unable to attend our scheduled tour.

"The tour is really unique, it shows displays of agents in training, and talks about the training they have to go through. It has displays of famous evidence (boat from the Boston Marathon Bombing) and interactive exhibits based on typical FBI duties (evidence collection, bank heists, hostage situations, etc.). I enjoyed it myself but I’d highly recommend it for families with little kids; there were a bunch running around and they looked like they were having a blast. My favorite part is that the tour guides were both retired agents and other active duty agents kept popping into the tour to talk and answer questions. We even got to see agents qualifying with their handguns. ",June 2018,50,FBI Headquarters,Nathan W,The FBI Experience was amazing

"The FBI Experience tour is pretty fun but is especially geared for kids so if you don’t have those it’s probably a little less interesting.  We have an 11 year old boy and this was right in his wheelhouse.  Lots of guns and stories about training and catching bad guys.  The tour is self guided, so you can go at your own pace.  The highlight for me as a former Bostonian was the boat where they found one of the marathon bombers.  This comes at the very end.  You can’t take photos inside but you can take pictures of the boat, which is outside the main tour.

First of all, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out where to pick it up (and we had the map). I was around National Mall route. The first time we used it we waited 40 min for one of the buses to arrive.

We spotted the bus whilst out one day and did some research on line as there was no leaflets in our hotel about it . We were intending to book a hop on hop off tour which is usually $50 + but the Circulator has a new service which runs round the Mall area for $1 per trip. You need to pay each time you get on but with 20 stops even if you got off at every one it would still be far cheaper than a tour bus.They use single deck buses so you are inside a bus rather than on an open top bus which for us was a bonus as it was teeming with rain . There are also a number of other colour coded routes - we used the green line from McPherson Square up to Woodley Park also just a $1. I believe you can also use your Metrocard and its worth investigating as it seems that you can travel for 2 hours free using that but as we didn t know about that I'm not sure of the details ,September 2018,50,DC Circulator,willow20,Excellent and cheap way to get around

they don't actually have fresh fish that you would expect from a water front fish monger. Its all dozen and brought in from somewhere else.

Fun visiting this fish market. A great variety of seafood available direct to public. You also have the option to buy your seafood and have it prepared for you while you wait or visit one of the restaurants which serves some fresh or deep fried seafoods. I enjoyed the experience! ,April 2014,40,Maine Avenue Fish Market,TJ SA R,Fresh Fish For Sure!!!
"I see quite a few people saying that the fish at the market is not fresh because it was brought in by a truck. That has to be the silliest thing I have heard in a long time. Of course the fish is brought in by trucks. For one thing, the seafood the market sells could not be caught in the Potomac river. If it were caught in the river, I would not buy it. I also read other reviews saying that the local Safeway has a better seafood department. To the guy who said that, I would really like to know which Safeway you do your shopping. Everything at grocery stores come in frozen on a truck. Most of the seafood that comes into the Maine Ave fish market come in fresh, shipped overnight and is put out, on ice, as soon as it comes in. I have been at the fich market at 5 a.m. and have seen what comes in and I can say that most of the seafood is fresh. Yes, there are some type of fish that are frozen when it comes in, but not many. The fish market is a nice place with good prices and in fact, I am going there today.",April 2014,40,Maine Avenue Fish Market,Dan T,Fun place to buy fish
"Visited the Maine Avenue fish market on a very busy Sunday afternoon. We arrived by boat after a great day touring the area waterways. Much like finding car parking, finding a place to get off the boat and shop the market is quite difficult. This was probably the worst thing about going there. But once we were there it was great to see all the displays of fresh seafood. Lots crab being sold there so I bought a dozen large male crabs from Captain Whites. The dozen turned out to be 14 crabs for $32, which I thought was reasonable. We had two small children with us and it was not easy to negotiate the crowd there.

While attempting to request a White House tour I noticed that the FBI was on the list of tours that could be requested. On a whim I selected this in addition to the White House because I thought my husband would enjoy it. The tour was interesting and highlighted the history and triumphs of the FBI and you get to see actual artifacts from major historical cases. There is a live fire arms demonstration of historical weapons agents used as well as current weapons. The demonstration is great because you sit in a auditorium behind a nice sound dampening glass wall. No loud noises! The downer was that your not allowed to bring cameras into the building which is fine because there isn't much to photograph but makes it hard to plan the rest of your day without a camera.

"This fantastic fleet of buses solved all of our transportation challenges on a recent trip to DC. We utilized the Red line, which goes all around the mall, stopping at most memorials, Union Station, and many of the Smithsonian museums. Buses come every ten minutes, many times more often, depending on traffic. Cost is $1 with free transfers within two hours. You can use your metro card instead of cash, making it super convenient. Stops are well located, and all buses are ""kneeling"" buses and so there aren't even any stairs to climb. It was great!

"Great for tourists and residents alike, the DC Circulator is a great way to visit the museums and monuments without racking up a big Uber bill. We got the 3day pass for $7 and visited union station and Georgetown in addition to the national mall. We even went to the Lincoln and Jefferson memorial at night because transportation was so cheap.great value!  Only minor downside is that, at least on the national mall circuit, drivers have to stop at certain stations to not be ahead of schedule.so don’t be in a rush and you’re fine.  Also, a big thank you to the ladies operating the mobile bus selling tithe passes at l’enfant plaza on Tuesday, oct 31st.

"Not the easiest place to get to on public transportation but people were very helpful when we arrived at Anacostia Bus terminal via metro.

There is a 20 minute video in welcome center followed by tour (we had group of 8 and were only one's on tour) of house by a ranger.  The tour/narration was excellent - any attraction looking to make their tours better should attend NPS tours - always top-notch.  House is interesting and well-done.  Our visit was on a beautiful Sunday and views overlooking harbor were great, really a fascinating spot to visit in hectic Washington, DC.  Return trip via public transportation looked a bit challenging, so we used Lyfft and the car was there in minutes.

"There were two adults and three teens in our group who went here to learn about Frederick Douglass' life/legacy.  We watched the 17 minutes video.  I would warn that during the short video, it shows brutality against slaves. It is fairly graphic and may not be suitable for younger viewers. But you get the message. The gift shop is small and has books, key chains, magnets and the like for sale.  There is an excellent full size sculpture in the lobby. We took the house tour.  Our group was a bit oversized and it was kind of difficult to maneuver around to look inside each room without actually going in. Our docent was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic  to tell the story of Frederick Douglass and his home. The house is fairly well kept and has only period pieces within. We walked amongst the rooms and received an education of the kind of person Mr. Douglass was and how life was like in the Victorian age here in America. We walked around the grounds afterwards. This is a magnificent property and with the acreage, you don't feel like you are in the middle of a city.

"This place should probably be required for every American. The park rangers who take you on a tour around the house really make you think about the man who lived on this property and the absolutely stressful life he must have led. To be born into slavery, to be treated as subhuman simply for being a black man, to yearn for justice and equality every day of your life - it was an exhausting existence, and walking into Douglass' property makes the visitor think about what life was really like for him, both as a statesman and as a regular guy who sometimes just wanted to spend time with his grandchildren. It is a lovely home, with a majority of original objects, so it is easy to see how Douglass lived in the space, but the guides do a great job pointing out details and illustrating his life.

"The Anderson House, also known as the Larz Anderson House, is one of the most fashionable mansions in Washington, D.C. ""A Florentine villa in the midst of American independence,"" according to one description. Located at 2118 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest, on Embassy Row in the DuPont Circle neighborhood, it was built between 1902 and 1905 as the winter residence of Larz Anderson, an American diplomat, and his wife, Isabel Weld Perkins, an author and American Red Cross volunteer. Designed in the Beaux-Arts style, it provided a grand setting to entertain American and foreign dignitaries, a showcase for the Andersons' extensive art collection and a backdrop for high-society galas. The Anderson House also included a walled garden, tennis court and three-story carriage house and stable. The 50-room, 10,000-square-foot mansion is Little & Browne's finest architectural achievement with its eclectic interiors, carved wood walls, gilded paper-mache ceilings, ornate iron staircases and intricate marble floors. It also was outfitted with the latest conveniences, including electricity, central heating, telephones and two elevators. Among guests who attended posh events in the grand ballroom were Presidents Howard Taft and Calvin Coolidge, General John Pershing, Henry duPont and members of the Vanderbilt family. When Anderson died in 1937, his widow donated the house and its contents to the Society of the Cincinnati, of which Larz Anderson had been a devoted member for more than 40 years. The Society opened Anderson House as a museum in 1939. Today, Anderson House houses the Society's national headquarters, an historic house museum and research library. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996.",September 2016,50,Anderson House,Taylor B,One of Washington's most fashionable mansions

They instead tell the story of who works for the FBI, how they train and what they actually do. The tour is mostly self guided with lots of displays, some interactive, however, there are individuals available to help guide you and answer questions. We were especially fascinated with Phyllis, a retired fingerprint expert who told us about her experiences and showed how fingerprints were cataloged before computers.

"For cooked blue shell crabs, this place had gone down hill. Oysters huge and tasteless. Quality of service decreased. Really got disappointed by overall.

The crabs I got were the worst I've ever eaten. 1st place on left that sells crabs in the main court area. Can't recall their name but suggest people stay away. Paid extra for large, they were overcooked. So disappointed especially since I was staying in VA. and unable to take them back. 1st place on left where they cook food, was great. Crab balls are the best. Never had them before. This was suggested to me to get by another patron, they were a pleasure to eat. Got their fried trout meal, great too. These 2 made up for the lousy crabs.  I got boiled shrimp, corn on cob, and oyster from a 3rd place, right corner in main court. They haven't disappointed to date. Always good.

"I have been to the National Archives several times and was very excited to bring my children for the first time. Although I use TripAdvisor often for advice, this is the first time I have ever posted a review. After inspecting the original constitution, my son asked me what happens to the documents at night.  Ignorant as to the fact, I told my son that we would ask the officer standing next to the document. I proceeded to, very kindly, ask officer G. Banks what happens to the documents at nights and whether they actually descend several stories as I have seen in the movies. She snapped at me and said “I am an officer”. I turned to my son and nicely said “She doesn’t know either” thinking that is the reason she answered that way. Officer G Banks immediately and unnecessarily created a scene and completely embarrassed me and my family, saying “don’t you dare say I don’t know, I told you I’m an officer and I won’t answer your question.”  She continued on her rant attempting to ridicule my family for no apparent reason. We immediately walked away from the exhibit and missed out on viewing other important documents.  This particular officer does not belong in a family friendly exhibit and unfortunately completely ruined our experience.

"Albert Einstein was a genius and an amazing man, and his statue is a fitting monument to him.  It’s larger than I had initially pictured, though I’ve read some reviews say it was small.  It’s easily accessible, right across the street from the Lincoln Monument and the rest of the National Mall.  I’d been to DC a few times before finally making it over to this monument and I wish I’d gone sooner! Definitely worth the slight detour to stop, take a picture, and read quotes from the man himself.  Use your gps, you might not find it wandering around, I was almost on top of it and didn’t see it.

"Fords Theatre is a must visit on any Washington DC visit.  Great staff and national park rangers to answer any questions you might have. You can now visit the Theatre, museum, The Peterson House and the education center.  Don’t miss out by forgetting to visit the gift shop. Depending on your schedule you could be here 4-5 hours.  If you can time it just right you might get lucky as performances are given at Fords Theatre again. You will just need special tickets for that event.",September 2019,50,Ford's Theatre,ronr821,Such a historic place must visit
"We've been to DC many times and Ford's Theater was always on our list but we never made it.  This time I planned ahead, and got our online passes (for a small fee).  We reserved our passes for the 11am tour that included the museum, theater, and Peterson House.  Not all times include everything, so select carefully the things you want to see.  We waited outside for a short time until the Ranger announced we could go in to the museum where everything you want to know about President Lincoln can be found.  Around 45 minutes later we heard the announcement it was time to enter the theater. The ranger did a fantastic job recreating the events leading up and after the assassination.  The talk lasted around 30 minutes. We also learned we could attend performances at Ford's Theater scheduled throughout the year.  We didn’t go across the street to the Peterson House where President Lincoln died since the line was very long.    Overall It was an memorable experience.",October 2019,50,Ford's Theatre,ariel1961,Take a step back into history

"Considering there is over 200 years of law enforcement history in this country, the museum was small and unimpressive. I am a LEO and visited it with 3 fellow LEOs (all from the Chicago area). All of us were very disappointed. We have no plans of returning to it. The Dupont Room was filled with Leftist ideology and is a slap in the face to law enforcement. It reeks of the Eric Holder/Loretta Lynch erra of the DOJ. The museum is way under done. If you want to experience a real police museum, go to the Texas Rangers Museum in Waco, TX.

"We went to this memorial because we had seen pictures of people climb up to touch Einstein's nose.  Story tells it that if you rub his nose you will gain some of his intelligence. You can see the worn spot where others have touched.  It is a spectacular statue and so detailed. We did like the other tourists, waited our turn to climbed to the top, rub his nose, and take our picture. Watch your footing going up and down, it is not easy but manageable if you go slowly. We are not spring chickens, in our 60's, and made it with only a small slip. We were more careful climbing down, so I guess we did gain some sense of intelligence after rubbing his nose. It would be fun to have lots of family and/or friends all stand on the statue in various places and take a great photo. LOL.",September 2017,40,Albert Einstein Memorial,CaliforniaRVers,Fun Memorial

The lighting in the museum is dim and sometimes the information is hard to see/read: I had to get up-close to the exhibits and displays, which is difficult when there's a crowd.

"This museum is not a govt funded museum like the Smithsonian so you do have to pay to enter it. Everything is housed on one floor and it is not nearly as big as many other museums. Because it is  so interactive, you will find yourself still spending as much time here as at other museums. You can try your hand at being a 911 operator, make decisions in forensics and touch and interact with almost every display. The coolest thing was the simulator. You are able to strap on a holster and use a very realistic side arm. You interact with the subjects on the screen and can even talk to them. Very very cool. They also have a lot of neat artifacts from different actual crime scenes. I'm glad we went. ",January 2019,40,National Law Enforcement Museum,Franklinmacd,Very interesting and interactive

The only downside is the food situation, which is somewhat abysmal.  All cafeteria's in Congressional House buildings are run by Sodexo, which also organizes the food for prisons...  If that doesn't put you off to their slops, I don't know what will.  The food in the Senate buildings is better, however I would recommend the main cafeteria in the James Madison building of the Library of Congress.

At the beginning of the tour you will be given a set of headphones to listen to your tour guide as there will be numerous tours taking place at the same time.

Decided to visit Ford's Theatre as we had walked the monuments. Great timeline and very interesting as we were from the UK - recommend if you are in the area. Lots to read and look at (we were there more than 1 hour and it is free). After museum you go to the theatre and see box where Lincoln was shot.

"Visiting the Ford's Theatre was always something I wanted to do but just never made the time in all my visits to D.C.  I finally made a visit there and I'm glad I did!  First, buy your tickets online at least a day ahead of your visit.  Opt for the earliest time slot because there are many tour groups/bus tours later in the morning.  Second, make good use of your time as you snake your way through the museum exhibits.  This can be difficult if there is a crowd for your time slot, as we discovered.  At a certain time, all visitors are ushered into the theatre itself for a lecture by a park ranger.  Our ranger was very good and knowledgeable.  You are NOT allowed access back to the exhibits once you have entered the theatre unless you ask permission from the entrance staff (I found this out during our visit).  Then you walk across the street (could be a line) to view the Peterson House where President Lincoln died.  Make sure to view the Tower of Books on Abraham Lincoln!

One of the tour guides was incredible at telling the story of the night Lincoln was shot, and the museum really helped place that story in the context of history.  Across the street is the actual home where he died.  We took our kids after three days of seeing so many sights, including some really fun stuff like the Spy museum, and they were riveted.  A real highlight of our trip.",August 2019,50,Ford's Theatre,sheena S,Took me by suprise
"An experience not to be missed. There are four chronological parts to the ticket. You first enter the museum at your designated time at the Ford's Theatre visitor center - we got our tickets on-line. The downstairs museum is wonderful, taking you through Lincoln's life up until his assassination. The only downside to the great exhibits is that some of the glass encasements were too dark to see - protecting their sensitivity to light. We paid for the personal audio tour but it's not necessary. The downstairs gift shop is run by the National Parks service, while the upstairs is Ford Theatre's shop.  Once you complete the downstairs, you go upstairs to the theatre and witness the box where Booth shot Lincoln.  There were several rangers available to answer questions and tell impromptu stories, and you can sit in the balcony seats to absorb the moment.  The third stop is across the street. You walk through the Peterson house where Lincoln was moved from the theater and see the bedroom where he passed; all furniture are facsimiles of the time. Finally you once again enter the museum from the Peterson house building continuing Lincoln's epitaph, achievements, and affects on us today.

It was a tour where you have to follow in a group and move on altogether. We only got to see the main building, but it was worth it. I wouldn't go with small children (under 10) as there isn't much for them to be interested in. Some good photo opportunities inside and there are restrooms and water available.

"We've seen it in movies and pictures but you can be there, walk over to where President Lincoln was sitting, and see where he was sitting.  It's too bad the actual blood stained chair was replaced, it's over at a museum in Dearborn Michigan. You can get a guided tour or rent an audio machine or just walk around without the audio machine.  You might get lucky like we did and get there between large groups. Remember if you rent the audio machine, then you have to wait in the line again to give it back to them. That's the only way you'll get your driver's license back.

The Theater itself gives you a strange feeling that takes you back in time while the ranger explains the sequence of events and facts.  This is a great place to visit and was SO worth the time.  Just be sure to get your timed tickets online before you go!,July 2019,50,Ford's Theatre,nickyzwick,LOVED IT!
The NPS runs Ford’s Theatre and does an excellent job. The museum is very thorough. The recitation of the Gettysburg Address by past presidents is very nice. Access is time controlled so it is not too crowded. Be sure and go across the street to the Peterson house where Lincoln died. It is small but moving.

"This sparkling white beacon on Capitol Hill is a must see while in DC. We booked a 1 hour tour in advance on the Capitol website and were shown around by Katie, a very cheerful and well-informed tour guide. The tour starts in the crypt where you can see (but not stand on) the star that marks the centre of Washington and view, all around you, some of the 100 state statues that live within the walls of the Capitol. From there you go to the statue room where a whole jumble sale of state statues is lines up around the walls. They change the statues regularly, but when we visited in July 2019, it was possible to view Thomas Edison, complete with light bulb (Ohio), Rosa Parks, beautifully seated (Alabama) and a chap called Marcus Whitman (Washington State) who I was sure I recognised but would have been unable to place had Katie not told us he was the inspiration for The Simpsons’ Jebediah Springfield. Most of the statues are white men of course, with a few notable exceptions like Rosa Parks, but the states get to update their statues from time to time so hopefully that might change. One more room follows – the dome itself. This huge space is breath-taking, with massive artworks (some with dubious historical context) on the walls and a frieze, depicting American history, running all the way around the base of the dome. The story goes that when the frieze was finished in 1889 there was a gap where the architects had miscalculated the required length. This omission was put right in 1953 with panels showing scenes from the civil war and the Wright brothers’ endeavours. All in all we were awed by the building itself and the principles upon which it was founded.",July 2019,50,Capitol Hill,Jacqui F,Great tour of Capitol Building
"I recommend this for anyone visiting Washington. The park service has done such a good job and preserving this piece of history. Go on line and pay the three dollars to make sure you can get in.

"Although the theatre is not the same as at the time of Lincoln’s assassination it has been recreated well and the balcony where he was shot has been marked in grand style. The tour includes the museum giving the history of the time, the theatre itself, the house where Lincoln actually died and an exhibition detailing the aftermath and the hunt for his assassin. Very interesting. It is free to get in but you need to get a ticket for a timed tour from the on site box office. ",August 2019,50,Ford's Theatre,katelY9936NH,Interesting part of history

I made arrangements with my Congress person several weeks before arriving in the city. It was absolutely great. We were escorted by a aid to the Congress person. Since Congress was still on recess there were very few people except for some of the regular group tours. Our guide took us places the regular tours did not go. Had great pictures taken on the Speakers balcony. Went inside the chambers. Had to leave our phones on a table before going in.

We tried to book a Capitol Hill tour online but all spots were taken. Then we visited the Capitol Hill visitors centre and discovered they save about half of the spots on each tour throughout the day for walk-ins. We went around 9 am on Saturday morning and only waited about 15 mins to get our tour pass. No food or drink is allowed inside but they will allow you to empty your water bottles outside and we were able to keep our empty stainless steel water container. We had a backpack with us and were allowed inside after a security screening process similar to when you go through security at an airport. There is a 13 mins video to watch in a seated theatre and then you are told which lane to go to when you exit to get a tour guide. You are given wireless headsets and can hear what the guide is saying through them. Our guide was great and you are allowed to take non-flash pics on the tour.

"We had the pleasure of visiting the holiday-decorated White House.  To do so, you must contact your representative's office and place a request or be a close and personal friend of a Secret Service Agent or West Wing Staffer. You'll have to supply a lot of personal info because you will be screened. We did ours in September and planned a trip to DC around it. Warning: the wait to get into the White House at your scheduled time will take as long, or maybe longer, than your actual visit, but it is definitely worth it. The day we arrived, temperatures were in the teens and, from start to finish, mostly outside in the weather, we went through 5 checkpoints including face recognition. Dress warmly! Once inside, after passing the obligatory DC gift shop, the self-guided tour flows through a number of historical rooms....the Blue Room, Red Room, China Room, etc.....all dressed up in their holiday best. According to a guide, volunteers apply for a lottery to assist in decorating the White House and participants are selected from every State. After Thanksgiving, the decorating is completed in 3 days and the First Lady does a final walk through followed by a dinner for the volunteers in the White House itself. Pretty cool!. Many of the rooms have specific themes like one decorated with a gambling theme (Trump casinos?) but all are magnificent. The main hall was all crystal and little white lights and it was truly beautiful. Go next year if you can get a ticket!",December 2019,50,White House,casallese,All dressed up for the holidays

Every room was more beautiful than the next. My favorite rooms were the card and book themed rooms. they even had a cool advent calendar on the window with all the first ladies. Since it was my birthday. My day was Abigail Adams. Then of course there is a bottle neck with photo ops. But instead of a selfie(selfie sticks are NOT allowed)ask for someone to take your picture., we offer to take their picture and the favor is returned in kind.  Also my husband had a cane and the secret service was so nice they took him down to the kitchens to use the elevator.

There is some great art in this museum and we loved our time walking around looking at all the art. We would definitely recommend to any art lovers who are visiting DC.,April 2019,50,Smithsonian American Art Museum,BagmanNZ,Great Art
"This museum is in the same building as the national portrait gallery but offers up modern art, folk art , sculptures and oh so much more. Located in the old patient office building you will find restoration facilities you can view for sculptures, paintings and even those magnificent frames. The way they present some of the modern art displays are really introspective and questioning. This location is open longer than the other Smithsonian museum  a so you can enjoy in all ranges of light. I love how the fuse both museums together from the striking portraits, landscapes, patient models, and sculptures to the whimsical flowing nature of modern vision.

"The American Museum of American History is an amazing repository of all things American both historical and cultural. Where else could you find  the original Star Spangled Banner, a $100,000 bill and Archie Bunker's chair? There are so many compelling exhibits it is literally impossible to see it all and it's changing all the time. We started our day there with the one hour tour which was meant to be kind of a sampler of all the different areas in the museum. Our guide, Marcia, was so knowledgeable and entertaining that our ""sampler"" turned out to be more like 2 hours! There is an entire wing devoted to transportation in America and it includes a locomotive and tender from a small gauge California train in pristine condition. The entry area features showcases of the original hand built models of famous inventions made for their patents like Tupperware, etch-a-sketch and the first typewriter.  Another area has a totally rebuilt New England house and it is shown in sequence how the house evolved and the individuals who lived there. Fascinating! If you get a little tired like we did, you can choose from a number of informative movies shown in a 3D theater. This is a jewel of a place and, whatever your age, you'll find something (like the original Batmobile) to love.

All your Congressperson does is submit your information and the WH takes over. The Congressperson does not get the tickets for you. The most interesting tour was of the West Wing. I had a friend who was an intelligence officer for the office of the Vice President. He took us on a private tour because he worked there BUT we all still had to be vetted by the Secret Service. It was very interesting. At least I can say I have seen the Oval Office(George W. Bush). Another great building to visit is the State Department. It's bigger and better.

It seems like everything they have is well done! The surroundings are beautiful and, best of all, it's free entry!

"This is a place I have wanted to see and finally got the opportunity.  Lincoln spent a great deal of time here during the Civil War and particularly after the death of his son, Willy.  The home is about three miles north of the White House and is situated on a lovely hillside so it was considerably cooler in the summer months before air conditioning.   The home was also used by Presidents Bucanhan, Hayes, Arthur and Garfield.  Our guide, Blake, was very knowledgeable and provided a lot of fascinating information during the tour.  The house itself is basically unfurnished so you need to use your imagination.  My one complaint is the heavy reliance on computers and TVs.  It would be far more in keeping with the time period to have the guides tell the stories instead of listening to some computer generated story.  This, for me, took away from the majesty of the place.",October 2018,40,President Lincoln's Cottage,NWRob,Historic gem

During our visit, we were brought there at the end of an after-dark ghost walk around Georgetown.  Our guide claimed she couldn't bring herself to walk down the steps but nearly all of our group did...and survived without a scratch.  In reality, it's a long, rather dimly-lit flight of steps, perfectly safe in the daytime but it does retain a certain air of movie-inspired spookiness.

"Like a supremely talented method actor, the Potomac adopts and sheds many personalities along its course, each lively, compelling and beautiful in its way.  In the West Virginia headlands, it's rocky, relatively narrow and turbulent, surrounded by cliffs loaded with ancient fossils (trilobytes mainly); above DC as it approaches the city's inner suburbs, it first deepens and tends to be surrounded by peaceful, leafy woods on both sides; upon reaching the Beltway, it enters a series of rocky, rapids-strewn runs that are popular with kayakers; then it widens out and splits into multiple channels surrounded by parks on both sides (Virginia's is most dramatic, Marlyand's gets you closest to the water level): here it's rocky, turbulent and lethal (countless people have inadvertently been swept into and then trapped & drowned in cyclic underwater currents that even the most powerful swimmer can't escape); when it finally emerges into the heart of DC, it widens out tremendously where it's traversed by kayakers, crew shells from Georgetown; sweeps under the landmark bridges (Key, Memorial and and 14th St.) between DC and Virginia whose coastlines include posh shopping and restaurants (Georgetown and the Watergate/Kennedy Center area) striking buildings in Rosslyn, VA, the silent reverence of Arlington Cemetery, and Lee Mansion; divides and surrounds Theodore Roosevelt Island; endures the endless roar of jets approaching National Airport; and, finally, widens even further to be surrounded in its majesty by the lush estates of Virginia (including George Washington's Mount Vernon) and laid back marine-oriented population centers on both the VA and MD sides before it ultimately dumps into the Chesapeake.

"This tour was done by an excellent guide who was so knowledgeable and able to answer any question posed to her.  She made the experience very interactive by asking us questions and then expounding upon our answers and our questions!!  My granddaughters 12 & 14 enjoyed it and they usually don't like things like this.

I learned things on this tour about President Lincoln's life, work, and experiences that I had not know before.  In each room the presentation was different and even though it was sparcely furnished the history became so alive as videos and President Lincoln's voice was played to enhance the history told.  It was an hour tour and tickets are recommended to be purchased prior to arriving.  Photos can only be taken outside but the grounds are so pretty--I can see why President Lincoln & his family wanted to spend so much time away from the White House & visit in this cottage.

"The tour office and museum are very impressive and the surroundings of the cottage and the adjacent servicemen's home are beautiful. I found the tour itself to be a major letdown. It begins in a classroom environment where the guide asks for input concerning the sorts of values that come to mind when thinking about Lincoln. Then, after the group has thus been intellectually tuned up, the guide explains that the rest of the tour will not involve lectures - she will simply provide highlights as we visit the cottage together. Finally it is time to walk over to the cottage where we pause by the entrance for a lecture (?) about the building and its surroundings. Once inside, we are greeted by bare floors, walls and ceilings, the starkness of which is only challenged by a blank TV screen off to one side. Then begins a very serious lecture (?) about the family in all its dimensions during which the TV screen comes to life with periodic video clips. The guide is well-meaning and has clearly been well-trained to deliver the tour (except the part about avoiding lectures), but there is no apparent logical reason to be standing in an empty building in order to hear a 5th grade history lesson and watch video clips. I bailed out after 15 minutes or so because my mind was wandering, my feet and legs were tired, and I had an overwhelming desire to be anywhere except where I was. I guess the powers that be could use civil war period photos to furnish the cottage in an approximation of its historical period. Then, tours consisting of a visit to the tour office museum and a self-guided stroll through the cottage would make for an enjoyable hour or so. As currently offered, I feel my pocket was picked of $15.00. Actually, I would pay much more than that to avoid the current tour if I had to make that choice for some reason. Clearly, it seems most reviewers have a much more positive view of the tour than I. You be the judge!",July 2017,20,President Lincoln's Cottage,GDLKP,Beautiful Setting/Horrible Tour

It is breathtaking in its historical importance and insight into the life of President Lincoln and his family amidst the loss of another son and the civil war. The presentation is very well done. It no longer has artifacts (the Home has had many lives after Lincoln’s demise) but it is no less powerful in its ability to convey the role it played in history. The docent (Diana) was excellent. The A/V presentation brought history to life. Several other presidents used the cottage as a respite from DC life. The surrounding land has a veterans home that pre-dates Lincoln’s residency and it still serves that function. The gift shop is stocked with thoughtful well-curated items many of which are made by survivors of modern day slavery.

The Cottage itself was in winter mode, where the displays were geared toward reflection and had an interactive exercise where you can add your Good Deed (done or intended) to others.

Lots of restaurants, a few shops including a bookstore and unique gift shop featuring items made locally. Lots of restaurants and bars. And if you like seafood, the west end has a bunch of seafood shops. Musicians perform live during the summer. Most of the restaurants/bars are a little pricey, but the Shake Shop offers burgers, dogs, and shakes (of course) for those with a budget or picky eaters.

The views are awesome, right next door to an awesome fresh seafood market worth checking out. I had lunch at Hank's Oyster Bar - the bar is truly top notch with loads of options and really well trained bar tenders mixing serious drinks! Food was great too. I'd strongly recommend.

Might have been more enjoyable with kids.",March 2018,30,Madame Tussauds DC,Lindsay S,Mediocre

"We spent almost $100 for four of us to tour the museum.  We thought the presidents hall was really nice- had all the presidents and they were quite life like.  Some almost creepy in that they seemed so real.  Once you get passed the presidents they didn't have very many figures it seemed.  Small section of celebrities and only 4 statues in the sports section... no football players, basketball players, gymnasts??  A hockey player, a golfer, a baseball player and a boxer were all they had in the sports room.  We took pictures with a few of the statues but didn't stop at each one and were in and out of the museum in under 30 minutes.  Seemed like a bit of a waste of money.  We literally came around a corner and said ""is this the end of the museum?""  They advertised some figures as being there that were not so I don't know if some were damaged or missing temporarily.  It was fun to see and the kids enjoyed it but it was pricey and not very time consuming for the money. For $100 we would have liked to have had more too see.",June 2018,20,Madame Tussauds DC,Angela S,Overpriced and disappointing

The presidents exhibit was great, with a plaque next to each president with information about them. Some of the figures were eerily realistic. They did have a photographer at the Barack and Michelle Obama figures but no others. Our kids loved the oval office (they could sit at the desk with President Trump standing nearby). Our boys are big music lovers and would have loved to have seen more musicians, but we were in the nation's capital so they were happy to see all the presidents.

District Wharf is both a destination and a starting point as you can travel to Old Town Alexandria, National Harbor and other water accessible stops around the area. You can dine high end here (Requin for example) or middle of the road (Taco Bambino, Ben and Jerry's). This development has brought a lot of life to an area that was pretty much dominated solely by two large restaurants (Hogates and Phillips). I believe these no longer are in business in this area.

The centre examines all facets of the executive mansion - ranging from the presidential families to inhabit it, as well as the ushers and housekeeping teams. There are a number of historic artefacts on display, including FDR’s desk. The video at the back is well worth a watch and gives unique views from the Presidents and first families who resided here.

From wooden Japanese warrior statues to a charming monkey sculpture, to an entire reconstructed dining room decorated with peacock designs by James Whistler; there are amazing exhibits around every corner. I had downloaded a kids’ trail for my daughter, which took us all over the gallery. You can find it on the Freer Sackler website. The downside of the tour is that it flits back and forth between the Freer wing and the Sackler wing and there are no room numbers on the PDF.

"This museum is most certainly worth a visit when in Washington, as it holds a wonderful collection of Asian art from all across Asia, from the Islamic world to Japan and Indonesia. However, the exhibition on pre-Islamic Persia was truly extraordinary. It housed some astonishing pieces of silver which were genuinely fantastic - up to the level of any museum in the world. The level of intricacy in some of the pieces was utterly spectacular, and also it was able to illuminate an area of art which is rather obscure and nebulous in the modern world. The museum is well worth a visit simply for this, as the aforementioned exhibition did everything right: it was engaging, informative and simply beautiful. However, the rest of the collection still is of a very high standard and some of the pieces, especially from early China, are also uniquely beautiful. Moreover, the Islamic art section houses some wonderful pieces as well, especially the Mamluk pottery and some gold with silver inlay. The peacock room was also extraordinarily beautiful, and also an undisputed highlight, as it blends the splendour of Chinese art with the art nouvou of the time that it was made. Overall, this museum is somewhat of an undiscovered jem, as although it is probably the best museum on the Mall, it is the least crowded by far. Consequently, I had many of the galleries to myself, which made it the experience even more wonderful. In total, this is a superb museum - I can only recommend that to visit it before more people discover it. Also, on another note, make sure that you include a visit to the gift shop because it holds some very beautiful pieces, especially the kimonos!",July 2019,50,Smithsonian Institution Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M.

One piece that was worthy of looking at, an exact replica of the desk  Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation.  It does give great pause to know Lincoln spent so much time in the cottage and to walk in the rooms he lived in during his Presidency.

"My partner and I did the pentagon tour. You have to book at least a few weeks in advance in order to get a spot on the tour (which is free) to ensure all the relevant security checks can be undertake. Also get there early as security took a while to get through. The security staff on entering the building were pretty abrupt at times, though the guides we had on our tour were excellent and extremely welcoming. We learned loads and it felt a real privilege to undertake this tour. The guides appeared really dedicated and gave us a good understanding of the history of the building and the military in the US. It’s very fast paced so walk quickly! ",September 2019,40,The Pentagon,NeilC286,Very interesting 
"We requested the tour almost 6 months in advance but were approved about 2 weeks before our arrival. In our opinion, it is TOTALLY worth it if you are in the DC area.  We had the big bus tour that dropped us off at the Pentagon City Mall.  From there we walked across the street to the Pentagon parking lot and around the Pentagon to the entrance where we passed a more rigorous security check than at an airport (the WILL do a full body scan so be prepared).  Once inside, there is a waiting area where you will be called for the tour.  The young sailor that guided us did the whole tour (about 2 miles walking) backwards which is pretty amazing (of course, he needs to have his eyes on you at all times).  He was extremely courteous and nice and our kids enjoyed asking him questions which were replied consistently and thoroughly.  My daughter's shoe laces got caught on the escalators going up on one part of the tour so when I yanked her from the steps, it caused a huge raucous which paralyzed the whole area for a second as all attention was on us (we were only 7 people on the tour).  When the guide noticed what it was, he chuckled and said to my daughter: 'Don't worry - it happens to us all the time.'  What a great thing to say to a kid.  The explanations we got for everything were very interesting plus there were a bit of fun historical stories in there about the cold war.  The 9-11 Memorial Room was humbling as we read the stories of the victims of the attacks.  When it was all over, we headed over to the Pentagon Memorial which made us relive the moments we had watched on tv almost 18 years before.  This visit was really 'worth it' as exclaimed by our 11 year old!",July 2019,50,The Pentagon,nickyzwick,Humbled to be able to visit!
"Finding out where to park and where to go was a royal pain. Get that squared away before you spend forever driving around. Once inside and through security, it was quite impressive. Tour guides are active military personnel and are trained in the process. Excellent tour guide even though I am partial to the Navy and we had an E4 Aviation Tech guiding us. Very well done!  The place is massive and the tour moves along quick. You could spend all day going through all the info and history on the walls. The Navy 911 remembrance room was very nice and respectful. Nice job Pentagon!",September 2019,40,The Pentagon,victork434,Great tour once you finally get there
"Before visiting the area, I had researched the likelihood of getting on a tour. ASI am not a US citizen it looked really difficult, verging on impossible. That’s understandable. So I knew that I could visit Pentagon Row shopping and at least walk thru to the Pentagon. Beware road signs directing you to The Pentagon - you can drive very close but only to drop off for the memorial - there is no parking here. It’s a very impressive building outside bu5 you can’t take photos.

"I was quite surprised at the exhibits featuring examples of zen influenced calligraphy, buddhist teachings, sculpture and art. We went room to room in the Sackler side going wow, wow, wow! Especially the Buddhist and Japanese sections. I thought it was very well done and exceded my expectations. The museum itself was quite peaceful on a Sunday afternoon and the central courtyard with fountain was a place some people just sat and contemplated things. The museum has a warren of underground hallways and levels where we bumped into a troupe of what apppeared to be Thai dancers getting ready for a performance! We never found the stage area but it would have been interesting to see that show. The Fleer side is just as impressive but my main interest is the Buddhist/Japanese area. You have to visit the Peacock room. The room itself is amazing but once you learn that it has been disassembled and shipped from England to Michigan and then again to the museum you can grasp the history on the well traveled room. As a side note, there is a nice gift shop on the lower level and we thought the restrooms here were the best around because they were spotlessly clean, modern and large. Once you depart the museum, spend a few minutes to get your zen on in the moongarden next door at the Enid Haupt Gardens.

"This tour needs to be booked well in advance. They will tell you to arrive one hour early to assure you make it through screening. You really only need to be there 30 minutes ahead. They will not allow you to loiter at the entrance so you will be instructed to go visit the Memorial. The Memorial is simple but meaningful in design. Go to the website while viewing for an interactive of the Memorial. The visit is really about being allowed the privilege of being allowed in the Pentagon. Security is tight, it’s the Pentagon. How many other countries allow you to visit their military headquarters? The tour is short and quick moving. There would have been some interesting displays to observe but you are not allowed to stop. A friend took a private tour with someone who worked at the Pentagon and got to see many other areas. Which is interesting to me. Who is assuring that these people are properly screened, vetted and do not take photographs? Given that there are around 25,000 employees, the ability to bring others in surprises me and seems like a lapse in security. If there are other things on your itinerary and you are having trouble squeezing this in, I would pass on this tour. It will eat up 3 hours of your time in terms of transportation, security etc. and is not close to other sites in DC. ",August 2019,40,The Pentagon,woostermom,Book in advance

If you see the Hall of Heroes where promotion ceremonies occur through every month, note in the wall plaques listing Medal of Honor recipients of various wars names like Teddy Roosevelt. As you walk through the various corridors, the portraiture will show how different are insignia across military branches. The portraits also show the senior civilian leadership across US history.  Noteworthy are the Vietnam War wall exhibits which serves up a multi-perpesctive historic presentation of that war, and the 9/11 memorial and chapel. Don't miss the courtyard which gives you a sense of the depth of the building, once you have crossed to it from the outer rings. There is much more. The Pentagon tour guides are required to memorize a 30 plus guide, so you can pump them with questions -- which they seem more than happy to answer.

The fans at this arena for hockey are terrible. They constantly yell out cuss words. And they are constantly on the refs blowing them even when they are reviewing a play and haven't decided the outcome yet. Very unsportsmanlike fans. Terrible example of sportsmanship for our nation's capital. Otherwise the arena is pretty average in the seats when they say lines all around & cup holders. Good concession choices. Average team store. I did like the fact that they have your TV and scoreboard in the middle but they also have one in each corner and they have screens on the backside of it for those sitting in the upper section. That was pretty cool. Decent Arena just shameful fans,October 2019,20,Capital One Arena,brucep460,"Terrible hockey fans, average arena"

The tour of Lincoln’s summer cottage and the associated museum is thought provoking and moving. Our guide didn’t just take us through the charming cottage but she got us to think about the mindset of the Lincoln family as they navigated their roles in our country’s journey to end slavery linking modern issues to the tough decisions Lincoln made to save the Union and ultimately abolish slavery. The optional walk around a section of the Old Soldiers Home grounds was interesting and nice on an autumn day. We took an Uber there but found the .8 mile downhill walk to the closest Metro station very pleasant and the cafe across the street from the entrance to the museum and home grounds was awesome if you love southern cooking!,October 2019,50,President Lincoln's Cottage,AnnC61,What a thought provoking experience!

We went to this place due to no White House tour tickets being available for our trip. We were looking around the gift shop and were approached by a very sweet lady who worked there. She asked for the kids names and the year they were born. She then proceeded to go over to the ornament wall and pick out the ornaments for the year they were both born.

The building is massive, 5 floors above ground and 2 floors below, the 45 minute tour covers 1.5 miles of an astounding 17.5 miles of corridors in the building.  However, when you look at the time it takes to get there, stomach the security screening, endure the sitting in the waiting room, along with a general walk around the corridors of a building, it wasn’t worth the time nor effort.

As everyone says you apply online, but I didn't get acceptance until a week before. Easy to get to on the Metro. Was there an hour before and then showed my passport as I'd and went through security. All smooth. Then sat down and waited. There is a shop to buy souvenirs and you can take a photo or 2 in that area. Good to stand and pretend you are doing a briefing. On time we went into another room and divided into 3 groups. We had an army and a navy guide. Then off we went up and down corridors.  It was too fast as other have said about the quilts given after 911 and also about the Vietnam war. I would have liked to have read these.

We walked by many, many exhibits but never really got the chance to appreciate them.  Our guide, a young lady with the Navy, did a great job telling the information as we moved on.  The building is as huge as they say.  At one point you can see from the outer ring to the most inner one.  The courtyard is visible at many times and that too is very large.

"You will need a ticket that is acquired on the internet to get into the Pentagon's Visitors' Center. Unfortunately, we were not aware of this rule and so could were not allowed in. The 9/11 Memorial can be visited without a ticket. It is a longish walk from the Pentagon Metro station. The walk does give you a very good idea of the scale of the building and the number of people who work there judging by the very large car park. No pictures are allowed of any sort, so don't even think of taking any because there's probably an invisible drone watching you. Certainly, the car parks are continually patrolled by military police, which is a very good idea because it keeps the personnel and visitors safe. Pictures are allowed at the 9/11 Memorial, which is very small indeed and not in keeping with tradition when you think of all the other very large memorial structures in Washington.

The only positives: the building is nice, and entry is free. There are very few items to see. They are mostly bead, textile, and wicker works created in the last 100-150 years, as well as American Indian references in modern US products and pop culture. The exibition goes as far to cover the Indian cultures of Central and South America, which is incongruent.

I have to say it was a little disappointing. We then went through security for the tour and were given a brief introduction from our guides on what we cannot do and have to abide by. The tour only lasted around 45 minutes and the only time you were allowed to stop and rad stuff was in their 9/11 memorial chapel.

Security was tight (understandably) and once in the building we gathered in a waiting area that had a small gift shop and some photo opportunities, as photography is not permitted on the actual tour. Our tour guides were a US Coastguard and a serving army officer who had completed a tour of Afghanistan and now conducts services and memorials at Arlington Cemetery. Both young men were fascinating and knowledgeable, but also very humorous! The tour just flew by and it was so interesting to hear and see all about the history of the building plus the military in general. It was also a moving and humbling experience to visit the 9/11 memorial. I would thoroughly recommend this tour and felt privileged to be able to take part and to be guided by the servicemen.

It is a self sustaining environment given the fact that at times, workers might not be able to leave. We also visited the 9/11 Memorial room inside the building paying tribute to the lives lost that sad day.  After the tour we visited the outside Pentagon Memorial, which is moving and very symbolic.

"Don't waste your time here! Sadly this Museum of the American Indian falls way short of being anything more than a Gift Shop & Cafe on the first level... and another larger gift shop on the second level.  These stores sell the typical south western jewelry and junk that usually attempts to demonstrate the unique qualities of Native American arts and crafts. Granted the building is architecturally beautiful, but it appears that all the funding went into the building and grounds. There is an impressive Bronze Statue in the garden pictured above, but there's No Ambiance or Atmosphere reminiscent of the American Indian throughout the Museum. The Exhibits are sparse, cheap looking mostly poster like prints, plaques, photographs and some movies. But the Museum lacks real historical artifacts, arts and crafts, tools, clothing, survival, farming and most importantly... culture. We kept going higher and higher hoping to find some light on the subject but each level was increasing dissapointing. We've seen better representations at Museums that don't claim to be focused on the American Indian.",September 2019,10,National Museum of the American Indian,Curt H,"Museum? LOL, Just Large Gift Shops, Cafe & Emptiness."
"I had not visited this museum in some time and it is an interesting combination of architecture and focus on certain areas of what is considered an “American Indian”.  First, the main entrance to the museum includes a four story area that is like an atrium.  It seems very aesthetically pleasing at first, but it became frustrating later as it felt like the space could have been used for more exhibits with greater detail of the different tribes in the Americas.  It is still a beautiful museum, but the exhibits branching off of this large atrium then felt tucked away.  There seems to be a big focus on Incan/Mayan and Canadian/Northwestern tribes.  These exhibits were great, but they helped highlight the lack of similar depth of treatment of other tribes.  To put it a different way, the museum seems dedicated to talking about “Americas” in the sense of the continents of North and South America.  One exhibit on Native Americans in popular culture instead seemed focused on the United States view of Native Americans without actually focusing on the tribes behind the different images that have become so common in advertising, etc.  It is still a great demonstration of Native American artifacts, videos, displays, and exhibits.

"With so much to do in DC, personally, I would leave this off your list.  The tour started with a ""security"" dude (not the normal Special Police that are everywhere) rushing up to my wife in the lobby as she was turning off her cell phone (after being instructed to do so) and being told if she touched her phone again, she could be arrested.  The guy's name is Jack and was was an a$$ to my wife.  With that aside, the tour was walking down a few halls watching a few printing presses, printing, cutting and stacking cash.  A bit like a glorified Kinko's.  Seriously, just not that interesting.  With so much history in DC, put this on the bottom of your list.  The highlight of the tour was a guy on the floor doing a bit of comedy with the cash.  He would take out a few sheets of cash and fan himself with it.  He had a stuffed animal that waived it's hands and he took a stack of 4-6"" of sheets of uncut bills and waived the corners like the stuffed animals.

Its sweeping curves, soaring spaces and surrounding water features and lawn all reflect the from-the earth traditions commemorated inside, and offer a physical and psychological respite from the hard angles and heavy, imposing facades of the older museums surrounding it. A good deal of the gallery space is taken up by temporary exhibitions; particularly worthwhile at the moment is the third-floor installation that depicts how Native Americans have been depicted in popular art. Elsewhere, however, the museum seems short on physical artifacts. The collection is vast, but too little is on permanent display.

"This castle was the original home to the early Smithsonian collections during the late 19th and early 20th century. The antebellum structure has an interior like that of a great wooden medieval hall. There are some interesting artifacts here that were collected during the earliest days of the museum.

"Love all the information and they have great displays with good visual aids. Recommend at least 3 hours to visit but can take much more time if you want. Only thing is their restaurant is not that great. Their food tastes great, but over priced big time and you have to carry a tray around to different areas if you want to get food from different food areas. Than you have to carry these trays to tables after going through a check out line.

"I typically feel thoroughly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content of the museums on the mall in DC, and I really looked forward to visiting the National Museum of the American Indian.  However, my family and I were underwhelmed by the lack of artifacts and a heavy reliance on placard centric exhibits. The whole thing could be compressed into one moderately sized room of artifacts and a few interactive kiosks. Most museums are built with the purpose of housing a compelling pre-existing collection of items/artifacts. In this case, we built the museum before collecting the artifacts. Apparently you are supposed to be impressed by the mere fact that indigenous peoples have been given a place at the national museum table. I think it’s a disservice, in its current form. True, the building’s architecture is beautiful to behold and could not be more appropriate for its content. But the marveling ends there. For the average visitor, this remains a beautiful space in desperate need of filling. Time will tell whether the curators wish to celebrate the accomplishments and heritage of the American Indian, or dwell on their plight. A lot of the former and some of the latter would be appreciated by most.",April 2019,20,National Museum of the American Indian,livefreeordieNh,Underwhelming

"Touring the “money-making” place was high on my kiddos list of places to visit in DC. We weren’t able to obtain tickets through our Senator’s office and I was concerned if we’d be able to obtain tickets based on other reviewers comments. We arrived at 8:15 and there was plenty of availability for the day. As others have written, you begin the tour with a film and then walk through to see part of the process. I used to work in manufacturing and have toured more factories than I can count, so seeing presses stamp some sheets of paper didn’t impress me. However, my kids did find it interesting and the most educational part for my children was learning that you can’t just make money to pay off the national debt (something my husband and I explained, not from the tour guide). I am very thankful I didn’t get there at 6:30 as one reviewer suggested to get tickets, I would have considered it a waste of time. If you can tour without much effort of standing in line and you want to educate your kids about the how money is made, then visiting the BEP is a worthwhile stop.  If not, I would recommend spending your time elsewhere.  In summary, we toured DC for 6 days and this was my least favorite.",May 2018,30,Bureau of Engraving and Printing,thankfulmom2015,Least favorite from our week in DC

I wasn't about to wait outside for over 90 minutes just to get inside a crowded museum so we went to all of the museums that had no lines.  this fit the bill.  it was sad to see all of the broken promises that our government made to the Indians and did not keep.  Even back then our govt. was breaking promises and treaties to the people.   Not a lot to see in this museum.  the most interesting thing here was the 15 minute video that talked about these broken promises.  just kind of sad.

"I was expecting some sort of modest display about the history of indigenous peoples in the US, but found quite a lot more. The top floor has an exhibit devoted to a set of tribes spanning north and south America, and was developed with representatives from the corresponding tribes. It includes artifacts, but also has a discussion of the philosophy/religion of each tribe, and it is fascinating to compare/contrast them. The third floor is devoted to the history of relations between the US and indigenous peoples. I was expecting a fairly one-sided presentation with ""the white man is evil, reparations for all native peoples"", but what I found was actually quite carefully balanced. While the early Americans certainly don't come out smelling of roses, the exhibit carefully covers the pressures on both sides of the controversies, and how vastly differing customs caused as many problems as deliberate treaty-breaking.

"I had not been to the Phillips Collection in many years, but it is a wonderful museum.  There were no special exhibits, so we just wandered through the permanent collection.  I loved the Jacob Lawrence Migration Series.  There are something like thirty paintings in the series.....the Phillips has the odd numbered ones, and the Moma in NYC have the even numbered ones.  The series depicts the migration of Southern African Americans to the North during WW1 to fill factory jobs caused by shortages of whites serving in the war. It is wonderful set of paintings.  And Lawrence said, that at the sage of 24, he had reached his creative peak.  Lots of other wonderful art to see.  And read about the history of the house....built in the early 1900's in the Gilded Age when there were mansion upon mansion in D.C.

"The Castle, site of the Smithsonian Museums’ Visitor Centre, is like a heavenly haven in the heat of a mid-summer visit to the National Mall. Located near the middle of the south side of the Mall, it’s perfectly placed either to get your bearings at the start of a visit to the Smithsonian Museums, or to take a break out of the sun in summer (or the cold in winter presumably). There is handy info there on all the other museums and a shop selling souvenirs from across the museum estate. There’s also a small café serving beverages and cakes and crisps and so on. Don’t expect to get a big nutritious meal there, but you will find snacks which will keep body and soul together until your next meal. The loos are also a bonus. There wasn’t a lot of info there about the building itself, which was (just so you know) designed by James Renwick Jr, who’s also responsible for a lot of the churches in Manhattan, and completed in 1855. Parts of it later burned down in 1865; the blaze taking with it all of Smithson’s letters.

"Thirty years ago, I took the course 19th Century Painting at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, New Jerseay.  One of the painting was analyzed was Renoir's ""Luncheon at the Boating Party.""

Guess where one if not Renoir's most famous paintings ever (aguably comparable in fame to the Mona Lisa) is located:  right here at the Phillips Collection !!  I coulldn't believe it, but it's true.

Usually, we are able to see many great works on that floor. On our last visit we saw a fantastic Gauguin, which we were hoping to view again.

There are several brand new chic establishments nestled amongst older sketchy spots.  Once inside the marketplace, there was food from several different cultures represented.  We headed straight for Philly Wing Fry and the food did not disappoint.  The wings and the fries were delicious.  The sub was one of the best I’ve had outside of Philly.

I suppose this could be handy if you were touring during the day, followed by a night basketball game. I recommend public transportation. Driving in downtown DC is monsterous. The arena is attached to a food court next door. Being downtown means plenty of other things in the area. There are plenty of concession stands and washrooms. It is easily accessible.

Again, we were blown away. They had a display of The Temple which was done by the man who has built many temples for Burning Man, closer to our neck of the woods. Also downstairs there were some virtual art displays that we perfect for our 12 years old grandsons, We all enjoyed our visit very much......The Temple was a treat, a time to think about our blessings and a little respite from the rush of Washington DC.

"I've always loved going to the Renwick Gallery that features craft objects. I has an ideal location across from the White House and an interesting history with Jackie Kennedy saving this historic structure.  During a recent visit I found some changes.  Their excellent gift/book shop has been restructured and now is more user friendly.  However, the great room on the upper floor no longer has paintings hung saloon style but hosts special exhibits.  Currently (May 2019) the whole space has been turned into a wood temple. Although I preferred the saloon style of hanging that matched this historic house, I did like the updated labeling that visually points to connections between pieces.

You walk down a long hall which shows photos and plans for the lay-out of Washington DC, the construction of the original post office and the renovation after years of neglect to the stunning Trump International Hotel.

I especially love visiting in the spring when the huge azalea collection is in full bloom. It is truly awe-inspiring and great for taking pictures of your loved ones in the midst of the floral explosion, or just of the lovely plants themselves. (I always like to put my loved ones in the shots to make them more memorable for them and myself.) For those of you visiting the DC area, make this close to the top of your list of things to do.

The lower level has interesting exhibits showcasing the history of the court.  The courtroom itself is beautiful and impressive  even if you are there when the court is not hearing arguments.  It is electric when the court is hearing arguments.

Fabulous museum with lots of very interesting exhibits that make well worth a visit. Only downside was there were lots of young children many of whom were far to young to appreciate their surroundings. The consuls that you need to use to ‘complete your mission’ were far too few in number so queues were quite long.

"Spent an afternoon while on summer family vacation in DC here - it was a cool respite from the relentless heat outside. Conveniently located in L'Enfant Plaza with food court, parking in the same building and metro nearby. Unlike the Smithsonian museums which are free, this one require a fee and it is recommended that tickets be purchased online and in advance to avoid disappointment. It was not overly crowded when we got there and were able to get tickets over the counter. The visit takes the form of a 'mission' starting with a video introduction and assignment of agent code name. Many of the exhibits are interactive, digital and all are educational. It is engaging for adult and children alike though I would think adults will find most of the content more meaningful. Definitely worth a visit.",August 2019,40,International Spy Museum,KhimLee,"Great fun, easy location, good for older kids - fees needed"

"Very nice park, but a little disappointing. The columns were fenced off so you could not walk thru them. Also, I guess because of the flowers in blown, several of the roads within the arboretum were closed. The fish pond was empty and my previous visit was a few years ago in and the pond was full with lots of fish swimming around. .

"It is a dying hobby but I have been collecting stamps since I was a school boy.  Indeed, my souvenirs from travel to foreign countries are often stamps!  So this museum (which has a fantastic display of stamps from all over, and often special exhibitions), also tells the story of the United States Postal Service.  The National Postal Museum is located just outside Union Station and I have often used the time before my train's departure to visit it.  There are stamps but also attractive artifacts such as a railway postal carriage with fascinating models, the pony express, and the early airplane mail service.  Of course, the collection of stamps is extensive, including many well known specimens.  There is a small gift shop with some good buys including a recently published book about the US Postal Service.  Being a Smithsonian facility, admission is free.  You learn much, from zip codes to how stamps came about -- a brilliant idea that was first implemented in England -- to famous collectors.  True, this is a narrowly focused museum and may not appeal to those who are not into this subject.  To me, a wonderful place for an hour or so to remind myself why I still love the hobby of stamp collecting and admire our letter carriers.",November 2018,50,National Postal Museum,150rajibs,The place for philatelists
The entrance to get to the tower is on the side of the Trump Hotel opposite Pennsylvania Ave.  There is a Starbucks located right next to the entrance.  After entering the building follow the marked passageway that leads you to the elevator at the base of the tower where you will be met by a parks ranger.  From there an elevator takes you up 9 floors where you get off and are directed by another ranger to board a second elevator that takes you up the final 3 floors.  At the top you have a great 360 view of DC.  From the intermediate stop you can see right down into the lobby area of the Trump International.  We were there on a Monday afternoon around 3:30.

"Entering, I thought that this was going to be a celebration of stamps, and nothing more. While there was a heavy stamp component, it's in a discrete, separate part of the museum.

Honestly the staff is so aggressive it’s overwhelming. The children enjoyed themselves once the staff was done with their hardcore spiel.  Lots to do and you can always skip something and come back.

Everyone gets an agent profile when they enter which you can use to help carry out a mission by stopping at different kiosks through out to complete tasks.

The views are great across the Mall & Washington although they do have metal string down the windows which makes the photos awkward.

There are regularly scheduled docent led tours.  There are two floors with exhibits and files of stamps.  Bob was a serious stamp collector and enjoyed seeing some of the uncirculated older stamps well preserved in metal files.  There are also special days.  The day before we visited was ""Baseball Opening Day Family Festival"" with special activities.  It is a Smithsonian Museum so admission is free.  There are escalators to go upstairs, and elevators for handicapped access.

We enjoyed the tour and our guide was so funny and made it a great time where we laughed and learned. You have to go in the capitol almost under the ground and be careful to bring small or no bags. Was a highlight of our trip. Takes about an hour ,August 2018,50,U.S. Capitol Visitor Center,wwm1006,Great tour! A favorite 
We booked this online a few months before we came as we wanted to ensure we made it. Worth being there a bit early to go through security and have a look at some of the exhibition before the tour. Our guide gave everyone headphones so it was great to be able to hear him loud and clear especially as my better half is partially deaf. Really interesting to hear about the history and see some of the original house and senate rooms used. I’d recommend this tour if you are interested in the politics and history. Nick was really interesting and willing to answer all questions. ,August 2018,50,U.S. Capitol Visitor Center,jla113,"Excellent tour, great talk by our tour guide Nick"

"The downstairs was closed off as they are changing exhibits but the upstairs has a great exhibit of a ""temple"" made of plywood pieces that people could write on as a remembrance of people who are no longer with us.

"The cherry trees in Washington DC bloom in late March/ early April. It is an amazing sight especially around tidal basin to see cherry trees with white and light pink colored flowers. Walk around the tidal basin is really nice. It seems that you are walking under a canopy of flowers. Be prepared to maneuver through lots and lots of people. Give yourself plenty of time to stop, take pictures or to wait for others to move on so you get a chance to take the perfect shot.  It is highly recommended to use subway to get to the tidal basin. Finding a parking spot for your vehicle could be a challenge especially later in the day. Although, it is crowed and getting there could be a challenge especially the days when flowers are blooming at their peak, it is worth the efforts. Please check online when the flowers are expected to peak and time your visit accordingly. The flowers stay at their peak for few days only.",March 2017,40,National Cherry Blossom Festival,iqbal66,Beautiful blossoming Cherry trees in Washington DC especially around the tidal basin.

As it was our  first time we headed straight to the information board only to find it had no departure infirmation on it. Obviously we looked like tourist and we approached a gentleman with a red hat,  red t shirt and a radio to ask for direction.  Jerry was very friendly and offered to help us. We were a little sceptical at first as he offered to take our bags but he explained that this was a free service and that we had a choice.  We looked around and saw some locals also being assisted by Jerry and from there on we relaxed and followed him as he took up and our bags to the train, unloaded everything and showed us the amenities.  We gave him a tip on the advice of the locals and it was money well spent. Thank you Jerry, and a great service. Would recommend if like us you are traveling with large bags.

"This venue is unbelievable and gets better every time I visit.  I have never seen a ""governmental"" site in any country that is remotely comparable.  If you are in the area - go.

"I visited the U.S. Capital Visitors Center on a very busy Tuesday morning after Cherry Blossom Week.  I arrived about 10am for an 11am tour.  There was a long security line outside going up the stairs.  It went quickly and I was inside within about 15 minutes.  I asked where to go for the tour even through I knew I was early.  They told me I was just in time to take the 10am tour if I wanted.  They “herd” you in a large auditorium to watch a short film on the history of our country.  It was great and made me very proud to be an American.  We exited to the rear of the theater into smaller groups with a tour guide.  We were all fitted with earphones so we could hear our guide.  It worked great.  We toured the oldest parts of the Capital and was given lots of interesting history regarding the construction, commissioning of paintings, statues, etc.  We ended our tour with a Q&A session.

"The blossoms this year seemed to last longer than other years. Many of he trees around the basin seemd to go from pink to white and then got pink again our final day there. There are different varieties of trees around the basin and in other areas close by. They have a bus in DC called the Circulator and it costs $1 It was fun riding it around several different routes (even goes out to the Zoo).

"This is located in the Trump Hotel. You enter by the Starbucks and wind your way back to two sets of elevators. At the first set your bags will be checked - no big deal. You ride a glass elevator up through the atrium of the hotel. This hotel is opulent so the ride is nice. Next you wind your way to the second elevator where you will view the ropes used to ring the bells- White Chapel Bells you won’t actually see. This second elevator is small - holds 5 people. Once at the top of the tower, there are two levels of viewing both in an open air environment. There are pained windows on one side but the 3 other side just have wires so it get quite breezy.

"We had some time to kill before boarding a train back home at Union Station.  This museum is located right next to Washington D.C.'s Union Station, so it is a great place to spend some time if you arrive early for your train or bus.  As you would expect, there is a lot of information about stamps here, but also a lot of great exhibits about the history of delivering mail and packages in the U.S.  My wife and I found the Pony Express exhibit very interesting!

"We made a 3:00 reservation with ticket purchase. As we entered the building large groups of kids, most of whom seemed to be junior high age, were turned loose by chaperones with reminders to meet at the exit in an hour or two.

"As someone who worked in the Court Service for many years I was eager to visit the Supreme Court. It is an impressive building in Roman style. You go through security but other than that you are free to roam through the marble hallways. Photography was allowed, to my surprise. The staff were helpful. There is a theatre where they show a film about the history of the building and includes input from some of the current and retired Supreme Court Judges. Worth a visit if you are at all interested in the law. It’s a shame the Courtroom was closed for painting, etc during the Summer recess but there is a model of it and you can see inside it on the film in the theatre. You enter through side entrances but at the end of your visit you can choose to walk down the impressive front steps which affords a good view of Capitol Hill and other Washington DC landmarks.

"The most disappointing part though was what the guide talked about. Maybe it was just our guide, but it was pretty much content free. “Hey, there’s a statue of Edison”, “do you know who this is - it’s Rosa Parks”, “Ronald Reagan’s statue is over a piece of the Berlin Wall”. With families, students, and some international guests I though it would have been a great opportunity to educate on how democracy works in the US, and how to involve yourself. I don’t think our guide mentioned once about voting, and certainly not about how the two houses operate together.

We stayed outside the city and took the metro in. Be prepared to walk.  We also used the Hop on Hop off which due to traffic was inefficient. The monuments themselves were great.

"Peak bloom occurs at the Tidal Basin in Washington DC on April first. No joke. However, weather permitting the blossoms stay a few days to a week. This past weekend, the temperature rose to low 80's. .A word of warning: Be prepared to large crowds, everyone wanting to take a selfie or landscape shot among the cherry blossoms. It was very crowded. Do not expect to get a prize winning shot unless you arrive way before sunrise. The white and pink flowers overlooking the Tidal Badin are a sight for anyone that loves flowers and long to be outside. Plan on wearing comfortable supportive shoes, a good pair of sunglasses and your patience. Stop and pose if you can. Construct a composition of the trees with the people or a building. Just live in the moment. The trees are only in bloom for a short period of time. Enjoy the outdoors",March 2019,50,National Cherry Blossom Festival,mayaphototrips,Its spring again

"I would like to tell you that there is no difference between the tours ( whether you walk through the door for a tour or set one up months in advance through your House Representative)except maybe the wait line is slightly shorter. I witnessed where the clerk that you check in with to validate your tour time that was set up by your House Representative told a man that he could stay in the line even though he realized that he had not gone through the proper channels and he was told “that’s alright you can stay in this line.” He clearly admitted that he just came in off the street for a tour. So from this observation and the fact that the lines were side by side, going through same doors, into same court room that tours are exactly the same. You see a tour guide in the courtroom that tells you you can not take any pictures in of the room. Gives you a brief lecture regarding the history, how cases are chosen, how cases are discussed and one ran out of time because people in our group were asking many questions, so he did not get to tell us about the architecture or much about the building of the building. Getting to see all of this is free and be prepared to go through airport like security each time you visit a Federal building of any type in DC.

There is a film and  exhibition, which tells the story of the evolution of the court, including the building itself, which dates from the 1930's.  The process the court uses to scrutinise legislation and hear cases is well explained.  There are also portraits of past judges and profiles of significant appointees (first female, first black).

This is a National Landmark that you can visit and walk through that's on a scale of grandeur not being done anymore. To understand the reasons that these buildings were made the sizes they were: out of the materials that they used; is to understand the history of their times, and by walking around all that history you can pretend to have slipped back in time.. for just a moment.. you don't want to run into a statue- they hurt- trust me.

"I'm not even into philately and I can aver that this is one of the most interesting museums I've ever visited. The exhibits are designed to pique your interest, the videos are short and information and hold your attention, and the mix of an interactive and passive user experience is superb. I could have spend half a day or more here. Who knew the history of mail and the US postal system could be so fascinating? There's part of an old train here, where mail used to be carried, Owney the mail dog, an airplane that used to deliver mail, real post boxes all over...the place is fun, colorful and worth exploring for hours. There's a table for stamp collectors to pore through boxes and take free stamps(limit to six, purely on an honor basis!) and two great computers for the visitor to make his/her own stamps. The guards were all sweet, as were the staff we ran into. I came twice, the first day spending most of my time having an interesting conversation with one of their regulars, an Allen Schneider, an erudite gentleman and a stamp collector. On the second day, I was actually bemoaning not being able to spend over 2 hours here as I was leaving DC.I had heard about this museum and avoided it as I was always afraid I would be poring over tiny stamps.

"We went to the exhibit on the Queens of Egypt, which is running into September 2019. We thought it was very informative, not just on the queens but also on the role of women in ancient Egypt. Apparently, they were allowed a larger role in society than women were in most ancient cultures. The most fun part was a 3D tour of Nefertari’s tomb. It had been raided, but the paintings were still on the walls. There are lots of statues of gods and everyday objects in the exhibit. Although there is a charge for the exhibit, right across the hall at the end is a free exhibit that’s just as interesting---depicting everyday life in ancient Egypt plus many sarcophagi and mummies. We learned how they have been X-rayed so scientists can see what the people looked like without unwrapping the mummies. I especially liked the “movie” screens showing a street scene and a river scene.",April 2019,50,National Geographic Museum,Ruth G,Good Eguptian exhibit

The gift shop was fun to browse, too.",May 2019,50,National Geographic Museum,Marlaree,Fun Cover Memories
"I highly recommend this exhibit! The artifacts are excellent.  However what really sets this exhibit apart is the the way that it puts the artifacts in context.  Through the lens of “queens” of Egypt, it tells a very interesting story of women and a bit of the life of common people.  This is something I had never seen in the many Egyptian exhibits I have visited.  This is a modern exhibition.  It makes excellent use of technology, including a 3D surround tour of the tomb of Nefertari, the first wife of Ramses II.  It is very engaging and not hokey at all.  There are many other smart uses of technology to engage the visitor and to impart substantive and memorable information.  It enhanced my appreciation of the very rare pieces on display!

"I'm a lawyer so I thought I would drop by for a minute and wasn't expecting much. Boy, was I wrong! Those imposing columns in the front? The oversized columns are carried over into the hall in front of the courtroom. I went on two days and there were huge differences. The first day that I went, the Court was not in session and the second day it was. The first day, I got to go into the courtroom for a lecture. The courtroom itself is rather small and intimate. The lecture is worthwhile. Make a reservation in advance so you don't miss it. There is a film in another room which to me was very interesting because it showed the justices talking about what they do. The film does not require a reservation. The entire ground floor is made up of displays and I suggest the one about women in the Supreme Court. Frankly, most of them are a bit pointy-headed. Now, Day Two was completely different because the Court was in session. The ground floor was open of course, but the main event was to get into the courtroom to hear and see the Justices in action. People lined up before 6 AM for a 10 AM oral argument. I showed up at 9 with hopes of getting into the argument that was supposed to start at 11 AM. Ha! After standing in that line for about an hour and realizing how doomed my mission of hearing the entire argument was, I opted for line number 2, which after another hour got me in for 3-5 minutes to peek through the curtains at the back of the courtroom to see and hear the Justices -- including the Notorious RBG -- peppering the lawyer with questions and hearing her excellent responses. Security on Day Two was strict and uncompromising. You cannot go onto the second floor where the courtroom is while oral argument is going on!!! If you want to see the columns on the second floor, come later in the afternoon. Anyway, I think either day is worth doing and both much more exciting than they sound. The weather was great for standing outside, so that helped. How do you find out whether the Court is in session the day you want to go? Look at the website for the Supreme Court. It will have a calendar for oral argument. If it is an oral argument day, then the Court is ""in session.""",November 2019,50,Supreme Court,Paula R,Awesome to think this is where the Supreme Law of the Land is finally spoken
Don’t forget to stop by the gift shop before you leave.  And take time to see more of the building too.   Arguments start at 10 am and end around noon.  So don’t plan on leaving until around 12:30- 1:00 pm.,November 2019,50,Supreme Court,SidMaxwell,Well worth the effort
"We booked through our House Representative. They have only been here in DC since January when newly elected. The staff person who conducted our tour clearly was not into it and told us that they were hiring someone to take over this because He was helping with legislation in Health care and it was clear that he preferred that to this tour. We did get a couple of interesting tidbits mostly about our founding fathers focusing on the ladies and not on the service to the country. Was told about the whispering part of the room where John Addams overheard what his opponents were discussing by pretending to lie on floor to sleep, while actually ease-dropping in on the conversations from across the entire noisy room. I left actually wanting to go through it again with more time and a better guide who actually focused more on the inner workings of the House and Senate. We saw old Supreme Court, but was ushered through pretty quickly and walked the halls ( favorite part) from the Cannon Building to Capitol. I got to see the elevator where the two women cornered Jeff Flake during the Kavanaugh confirmation. That was priceless! And also where the media get to interview their prey. So all in all-It is definitely worth a visit!",September 2019,40,U.S. Capitol Visitor Center,Shereetravel,Toured Through Representative 
"The Visitor's Center is the entry way for a variety of tours of the Capitol Building.  The tours are free and you do not need to book in advance (but upon entering the center,you will need to go thru security) ; Capitol tours leave every 10-20 minutes.  The basic tour includes a short introductory film on the building and Congress itself as well as visits to  the ""crypt"" (find out why this area is so called), the Rotunda and Statuary Hall.  Our tour guide was excellent - well-versed in the history and with interesting stories to tell. Each State has 2 statues on display to honor native sons or daughters - and the guide made sure that all saw the statues representing their home State.  The tour lasted about an hour.   In addition to the Capitol tour, I  took one of the specialized tours available; this one on women's suffrage visited statues and items associated with leaders of the women's movement.  Again, the guide for this tour was terrific.  Other specialized tours (usually scheduled for only one time slot per day) cover such areas as the Capitol grounds, the Old Senate Chamber, Halls of the Senate and Freedom Fighters. Pick up a flyer inside the center to see the schedule for the day of your visit.  This is an impressive building and a visit inside is a must - to see the artwork (be sure to look up at the ceiling in the Rotunda) and to learn the history the historic figures who walked these halls before you. Each tour group relies on headsets - so you easily hear the information given by your guide and not other background conversations. Depending on the season, visitors may have to wait in line for their turn to tour. The tours are popular! Because of time constraints, visitors are not always able to spend as much time as desired looking at certain objects. Still, the guides provide a lot of information. The tours involve climbing steps - however, our  guide made special arrangements for some in the group who had problems with steps to use elevators. Note: If you want to see the House or Senate in action, you will need to get a pass from your Representative or Senator.  There are restrooms, gift shops and a restaurant on-site.

The introductory film explained a lot about the Congress and our guide Scott Jung was really enthusiastic and knowledgeable.

"Outstanding! There are over 5,000 + cherry blossom trees in DC and many more around the city.  We drove directly into Alexandria and stayed there for the week.  Took the Metro ($4)into DC and took the Water taxi ($10)into the city another day. We stayed at one of the hotels on King Street which has a free trolley from one end to the other to the wharf with a stop right outside our hotel.  No fuss with traffic —-Either in Alexandria or DC... we saw the blossoms in full bloom April 1 to April 4.  The time of peak changes from year to year so please check when they predict.  We had reservations the last week of March, but had to move them up to first week of April. They were In Peak bloom starting April 1.  Absolutely gorgeous!  One more thing off my bucket list.  Well worth the trip!  Stunning, beautiful,unbelievable. Take a break to visit the museums and a nice lunch and walk to more museums and have a nice dinner either in town or what we did was go back to Alexandria by metro late afternoon to change and have a nice dinner and relaxing cocktail . We didn’t have any traffic issues before, during or after our wonderful amazing cherry blossom trip  drinking was not an issue on our vacation. We parked our car at the hotel April 1 and didn’t take it out until April 6 when we visited Mount Vernon Estate in Alexandria on our way out.

We were in the suite section, which I asked if there was a relief area for my dog, within minutes I was notified that they did not have a relief area but they put a process into place that when my dog needed to go out I would take her to them and they would take us down to the closer green patch outside the stadium.

I saw the real thing in 2016 before the restoration and now was amazed at how beautiful it looks after the restoration.  They also had six virtual reality headsets of a more detailed look at the church, but the sound only worked on three of the headsets.  (It was much better with sound.)  Next was the Titanic exhibit, which looked at the discovery of the ship's remains and featured artifacts both from the ship and from the movie.",November 2018,50,National Geographic Museum,Robert D,Two excellent exhibits
"This was the best museum experience ever! The Virtual Reality for the Tomb of Christ was so magical and beyond every expectation--I just returned from Jerusalem and felt as if I were there and definitely felt that in some ways I was getting a 'better experience' than being there live.  I can't believe I am writing this.  Children to adults will love all exhibits--I think everyone should do the Titanic ""quiz""--really helps you get into the details of the exhibit.

We had no idea what the Tomb of Christ would be and was absolutely blown away. It was utterly fascinating and totally immersive in that we felt transported to the actual sites through the clever multi-media and VR technologies. Also, it was the perfect size for us since we only spent maybe two hours total including the gift shop, and browsing some of the permanent exhibits.

We got our tickets thru groupon and got a $10 food voucher with each ticket.   That helped a lot of food cost.  The stadium is nice. It's really hot and sunny even for a 7:10 PM game.

The weirdest part was that the general access gates beside us were allowing bags of similar shape and size in.  We had to figure out on the spot how to manage my son’s condition as well as how to handle his insulin and supplies which was upsetting and stressful.

Very convenient (1 block) to the Metro stop on the Green Line so you don't have to worry about driving and parking. the stadium itself is very clean and directions to seats are clear so there is no issue finding your way. Ushers are at the bottom of each section to help direct you to the proper seats. Please make sure you bring sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen if it's a day game as a lot of the seats are not in the shade. My recommendation is try and get seats along the 3rd base side of the field and you stand the best chance of being in the shade.,June 2019,50,Nationals Park,John M,Nice Venue for a Game

"We were very fortunate to see two exhibits - The Titanic and the Tomb of Christ. The Titanic featured insights into the lives of a number of its passengers and people working on the ship. It reviewed the background of their personal lives and what type of staff position or passenger they were on the voyage.  You were able to see the different accommodations for first, second and third class passengers. This was all quite interesting. Various artifacts were also on display. The second exhibit on the Tomb of Christ was really special since it encompasses the use of virtual reality. This technology brought you to the specific site in Jerusalem so you felt like you were actually there. This was truly amazing. Never experienced anything like this before.",September 2018,40,National Geographic Museum,Jim S,Great exhibits definitely worth the visit

Of course, there were multiple medias and the photography was what you would expect from National Geographic.  The Tomb of Christ was a 3-D journey exploring this most sacred site celebrated by many religions.  Admittedly, some of the 3-D made me a little queasy, but it was really cool.  They also had static displays about the area and it's stories.  Totally worth admission.",August 2018,50,National Geographic Museum,BeckyBea,Pretty cool

One tree had been tended for over 100 years by five generations of the same family! Certainly causes reflection on our obsession with instant results and gratification.

"The Washington Nationals are my favorite baseball team.  I wish that I could say that Nats Park was my favorite ball park, but I can't.  Going to a ball park is about the game yes, but one should also get the feel of the city that you are visiting.  While at Wrigley, one gets the feel of Chicago simply by looking out to the bleachers and seeing the old row houses, Ivy covered walls and the L that passes right by the stadium.  The same is true for Camden.  The brick blends in nicely with the historic warehouses nearby, and one gets some nice views of the skyline and the harbor nearby.  While sitting at Nats stadium, one feels like they could be in any big city, even with several historic landmarks very close by.

So Dear Evan Hansen was the last show of the theater season and I think that the biggest issue I had is that the South C entry does not allow you to use the ramp up to the B level so when I tried to drive around to get to the north entry the circle was closed as they were shooting for s movie. I had to drive around DC and almost got lost trying to get back to the Center. Kennedy Center why have a ramp if you are not going to have it open. I eventually got back and parked. The upstairs area was a tad chaotic as Aladdin is still going on but I was able to go to the far end to get a snack without a line. The Eisenhower theater is great as it has been renovated in recent years and the sound quality is great. The show was great though s tad slow paced. Also a joy.

"Went to Nationals Park for the Yankees-Nationals series on May 15th and May 16th. The first night, trying to get something to eat before the game was a hassle as none of the concession stands seemed prepared to handle the crowd (both games were sold out). In the bottom of the 6th inning, there was a rain delay,so I went to the men's room. When I tried to go back to my seat, I was told that I couldn't go back to my seat, even though my seat was under cover; I had to stay in the concourse with the other fans! I made my way to the lower level concourse where at least there was some room. After about an hour, it was announced that the game was suspended (The score was tied 3-3) and would be resumed the following afternoon at 5PM followed by the 7PM game. The next afternoon, fans were being let in at 3PM despite a light rain. With this being the Yankees only trip to Washington, you would think that every effort would be made to get the games in, especially after opening up the ballpark. At 4PM, it was announced that the games had been postponed and would be made up in June. It was hardly raining!! I've seen games played in worst weather!! Why bother opening up the ballpark and letting fans in if you're not going to at least try to get the games in?",May 2018,10,Nationals Park,Stephen K,Worst Experience Ever at a Ballpark!

I regard this museum as among the most important sites to visit in Washington DC.  The museum is dedicated to the concept of Free Speech which is the hallmark of a free society.

Make this museum among your top priorities in visiting Washington DC.  Sadly the museum will be closing at the end of the year so if you have the opportunity I encourage you to visit the museum.  It seems a twist of irony that the museum's closing coincides with the current regime that does all it can to manage the free exchange of ideas and tries to censure ideas that are not consistent with their ideas.

"We went for the first time on Labor Day and has such a good time. It’s $25 for parking, as the park is free. The park opens at 8, we got there at 10. We had to wait in line for the parking for about 20 minutes as it filled up fast. There is a ton of walking, my only complaint is there aren’t any trams. It’s also hilly so be prepared. Wear sneakers and hats. Next time we will bring lunch because some of the cafes only have snack type food. A map is $5, but we realized after we paid for one that they have maps all over, so it’s not necessary to buy one. I’d recommend going in the Fall, on a week day, as it would be less crowded and cooler. They do charge a lot for food, but it is decent tasting. A slice of pizza was $5, and the chicken tender combo with fries was $10.50. They do charge a ton for a water which was $3.30. Bring as much water as you can, so you don’t have to pay a lot for it.

"This zoo has a huge population of well-cared for animals, including seven elephants, six gorillas and three pandas. You have to go. There are pandas! The zoo is free to enter since it’s a Smithsonian place and those tend to be free. We came in from Beech Drive at opening time on a rainy day and we just literally walked in – the first time I have walked into a zoo without paying in my life. From there we moved northwest and uphill up the zoo, encountering farm animals, the Amazonian wildlife building and the American trail with Andean bears, bald eagles, seals and sea lions. At the top of this section is the elephant outpost and here is where we found out what this zoo is about. This is not a zoo where you are going to go along and see animals perform for you. Some years ago they converted their highly populated main animal enclosures from side-show style encounters, where you could see an elephant, a rhino, a hippo and some giraffe all in the space of a few minutes, into spacious single species areas, where the animals can get the best possible interactions with each other. The zoo seems to have been ahead of its time in working out that if you want to allow the animals room to breathe and behave, you have to sacrifice somewhat the experience of the humans who come to gawk at them. As a result, the elephants (all Asian) now have a huge roaming area and if you don’t immediately find them you may have to trek around the elephant trail to get a glimpse. One keeper told us that people get annoyed when they can’t see the elephants at one spot and then they walk around to another and the elephants have moved. Of course it’s brilliant that the zoo does this and, because it’s mainly funded by the government, it can stick two fingers up to the non-paying public and put the animals first. Well done Smithsonian! However, it does make for a slightly tiring experience. It felt like we walked a long long way for not much animal watching. After the elephants, we went to see the gorgeous pandas. We waited around for a while to see if any would emerge and one did, sitting down to chew on some bamboo shoots. By this time, we were getting short of time so we raced around the mammals section. The small mammals’ house does still have small enclosures where you can see lots of mammals in a small space of time, including incredible anteaters and some amazing runs for mole-rats. The primates seemed a little bit glum but their enclosures were quite large. The orangutans have an incredible high wire sort of construction where they can leave their enclosure and swing around over the heads of the public and other animals. We would have loved to see that, but none of the primates were being all kept inside because a storm was brewing. The last part we saw was a big hill with a moat around it divided into three enclosures for tigers, female lions and male lions. These are quite large and we did see the big cats roaming around. All in all this is a brilliant zoo with very high ideals and we enjoyed our visit.",July 2019,50,National Zoological Park,Jacqui F,Great zoo with high ideals

I was there for 5 hours, which allowed me to see everything I was interested in. Granted, you could feel you explored everything in half the time, but I took advantage and watched many of the videos. Too many to list. Specific items I loved besides that were the room with the newspapers of major news events; News History; 9/11 exhibit. The other exhibits were very good, and also nice was the view of the Capital and Pennsylvania Avenue, which was enhanced by seeing pictures of how it has evolved.

"I had not even heard of this museum until shortly before my trip to DC when two friends of mine (Independently) told me that it’s not to be missed! By the first 15 minutes there, in the middle of the FBI exhibit, I was totally amazed! They were absolutely correct. The collection is absolutely incredible!! I was expecting a news museum, but I hadn’t realized that it’s really a “history” museum in a lot of ways, because news follows and reports on what becomes our history. They have the actual Unabomber’s cabin on display, the largest section of the Berlin Wall outside of Germany and one of the few guard towers left in the world, the actual door from the Watergate office building where “the Plumbers” taped the lock to keep it open during the bungled break-in at the National Democratic Headquarters, the Pentagon Papers... I could go on and on as it’s 6 or 7 stories. And for kids, there’s an entire interactive floor where you can pretend to be a newscaster and do all kinds of fun things like that. It really has something for everyone. I wish I had set aside more time to explore it, there’s just so much to see. So that’s the good news. The bad news is that it’s closing at the end of the year. What?!?! How is that even possible?! This place is amazing!! I asked around and a staff member shared that it’s too hard to compete with the free Smithsonian museums just across the street, as the Newseum charges admission (even with a ticket that you can use for two days). A quick Google search when I got back to my hotel room told me the rest of the story. They’ve been struggling financially for much of the time they've been in this location, for exactly the reason she said. The Smithsonian Museums don’t have to pay a mortgage and this particular spot is one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in the city. So in an effort to save the museum, they’ve sold the building to Johns Hopkins University and they’re set to move out at the end of the year. They hope to find another spot to reopen and hopefully try and keep the collection together, but so far they haven’t announced anything. Bottom line: See this museum soon, before it’s too late!! They do charge for admission, but it is worth every penny!!",August 2019,50,Newseum,cwcdesign,The collection is absolutely amazing!!!

It has everything relating to news from the history, the Pulitzer Prize winning photographs, a radio tower from Ground Zero that had been atop the World Trade Center as well as several other artifacts like engine parts.

All 3 of these exhibits brought tears to my eyes!  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this museum and I think any age would like their interactive activities!  They have a little food court if you want to grab a quick bite to eat and there is lots of staff around to help.

We came here with our infant and my parents over July 4 weekend. It was hot and humid so some of the animals were hiding to stay cool. The elephants were out and about and none of the animals seemed distressed like other zoos I had visited before. We enjoyed the misters that were set-up in the park - big crowds there. We were able to get through most of the zoo within an hour. The park was very stroller and mobile scooter friendly. Some areas of the park offered shade so that was nice considering the weather.,July 2019,40,National Zoological Park,BucketListExpl0rer,Small Zoo - Great Visit

It was frustrating to see the park rangers families go up to the monument and see it.  So close yet so far away.  It was still amazing to see and have that experience.

"I took the advice of other peoples reviews. Get there early. We went on a Sunday and arrived at 9:00 am. I noticed that parking spots were filling fast, but I was still able to get a good spot. Be prepared, the zoo is built on a hill, so the little ones and elderly will need to take some breaks along the way. There are plenty of food options all over the zoo, expect inflated prices on food and drinks. I do recall a slice of pizza was $5. We got lucky, the Pandas were out and playful. The elephants were walking around, some animals were still having their breakfast. The most adorable thing was the little orangutan climbing on everything driving his mom and dad crazy... It's nice to see that other species in the animal kingdom have to chase thier little ones too. ",July 2019,40,National Zoological Park,mike_finds_the_best,For animal lovers

"While this museum is incredibly well done and thoughtfully prepared it has a theme of tragic and sad news as well as heavy topics.  The Pulitzer Prize winning photos are stunning and the stories they tell are gut wrenching and demand we look at the world we live in and ourselves.  There is also a piece of the Berlin wall as well as many other striking artifacts from 9/11, Boston Marathon Bombing and other such events.  Most of the exhibits are heavy topics that leave the visitor a bit depressed.    There is an exhibit about the history of news which is very nicely done. I wonder why the museum's curator chose to highlight  turbulent topics? While these topics are what has brought change to the world so have many other topics as well (inventions, discoveries, advances,  politics etc...) would have been nice to have variation.  So... while we LOVED so many parts of the museum... I am not sure it hit the mark overall.  I mean they have tissues for when people cry!

"I visited your museum today, 9/2/19 and I was very disappointed. The first place we entered was the children’s area. I have a 4, 6, and 9 year old. The lady working the kids area was very rude. She is NOT friendly to kids at all. It is very apparent she has never worked with children.  My older 2 sons took their shoes off and began playing in the play area. My 4 year old daughter did the same.  The lady then yelled at her and said she couldn’t play. I thought maybe she was going up the slide. She started crying and said she wasn’t allowed to play. I walked over with her to help her play correctly and then the lady yelled again and said she couldn’t play. I began looking at the signs thinking maybe she was too small. Then the lady said she has to have socks. I said oh ok. I didn’t realize. So I walked around to the other games to help my daughter play.  My daughter and 6 year old began playing the game you try to get the little balls in the boat. But you have to angle the game to move the balls. So they both began moving it. The lady then yelled, “no no no, we’re not going to do that”’. At that point I was done. I told my kids to get their shoes and let’s go. We visited a lot of the other floors, and watched the movies.  It really is not kid friendly at all. I would have thought it to be better. So I will put the word out, the museum of the Bible is rude, unfriendly, and not made for kids.  I will never be back.  I am a Christian and I have never seen a lack of love and compassion in my life. Very disappointed!!!!!",September 2019,10,Museum of the Bible,Krystal0324,Not for children

It is absolutely fanstastic and very well-done!  The displays are new, modern and comprehensive.  The Hebrew Bible Experience is one of the best museum exhibits we have ever experienced!  In it, you move thru the Old Testament complete with flaming bushes, breezy tents and blazing light.  Incredible!  There is SO much information that it can be overwhelming so recommend getting the audio tour (which we did not do).  We bought tickets in advance online to save some $$ and also took the virtual tour of the lands of the Bible which was well worth the extra cost.

What a difference a year makes!  Firstly, last time there was no entrance fee, aside from any contribution you wanted to make. This year the ticket price is $24.99 (it is a private museum, not part of the Smithsonians). It is well worth it!  The many exhibits are awesome and make the bible come alive.

We covered almost all of the exhibits in about 5 hours. What a wonderful experience- walking through the Old Testament was our favorite part. They did a fabulous job of different displays and presentations in each exhibit where you were not bored and made it understandable plus enlightening.

"I had marked the Museum of the Bible as a “must see” due to a couple of recommendations from friends who had visited during the spring.  So while on a trip to the D.C. area to see my son, I spent a Friday morning in this new attraction.  For anyone who has a historical or spiritual interest in the Bible this will be the highlight of your trip to the nation’s capital.  The museum is just a short walk from the U.S. Capital Building and the National Mall.  It is six stories high and filled with biblical antiquities, visual interactive activities and exhibits for those of every age.  The cost is $20 for adults and I believe $10 for children (that’s if you purchase online. It’s $5 more for walk ups).  There are a couple of attractions that also cost extra.  The one I would recommend is the Washington Revelations for $4.99.  This Disney/Universal type experience is a 6 minute simulated flyover of Washington D.C. showing actual biblical references on key landmarks.  I actually did the $49.99 membership which is an unlimited one year pass, which included the Washington Revelations experience.  This membership also allowed me to enter one hour early into the museum at 9:00 am.  As a result, I went straight to the 4th floor and spent the first hour by myself with all of the ancient Bibles and archeological artifacts in the museum’s collection.  This floor also has an outstanding “Drive Through The Bible” video series throughout the fourth floor Bible exhibits.  The third floor has the “Stories From the Bible” which is a 30 minute high tech audio visual experience highlighting the Old Testament stories.  Kids and teens will love this.  There is a children’s interactive play area on the 2nd floor, gift shop and cafe on the first floor and Slave Bible exhibit in the basement area.  There is a great panoramic view of the capital city from the 6th floor and even a nice restaurant up on this floor.  I spent almost 4 hours in the museum, but I was by myself, and I love history.  I think for a family with children, then two hours would be a fun-filled fascinating experience before they would get bored.  Even though this is a museum, it is designed to entertain the modern consumer.  The time, money, and attention to detail makes this one of the best museums I’ve ever visited.

The zoo surroundings are beautiful and the larger animals have lots of room to roam around. They are not trapped in small confined spaces which was pleasing to see.

This museum is easily our favorite in DC now.   It is a bit expensive, but I found it to be worth the money.  Not evangelical, preachy, or religious.  I know, it's the bible, so it is religious, but they do not push a specific perspective.  About half is devoted to the old testament and half to the new testament.  Very historic based.  Just the facts.  No one tried to preach to us or push a certain biased view on us.  They have an amazing collection of incredible artifacts that make you feel like you're in the bible while you're there.

"This zoo is a real gem, nothing like our over-crowded zoo at home.  So, my son and I went right at opening time (8am) on a weekday in September (after stopping right across the street at Starbucks).   Walking through the entrance into a wooded area and seeing no one else around and no ticket booth, I wasn't sure we should be there.  So that was the first amazing part, that is was free!! and that we had the zoo to ourselves, literally!  I don't think we saw another person for quite some time.   Our favorite animals to see were the pandas, wallabies and the orangutans on their o-line (wow!).   Even being on our last day in DC and sick of walking, the zoo was more compact than I expected and easy to walk through without tiring out.  We ended our great day at the gift shop were there are tons of stuffed animals to choose from (like a red panda) and waited for a bus to take us back to the Metro stop while eating a Dippin'Dots treat from a vending machine.

"This was one of my favorite places to visit while I was in Washington D.C. You can literally walk up to the monument and touch a piece of history. It is made out of huge blocks and The Freemasons are partly responsible for building it. On a nice day, the atmosphere seems so rich with beauty and fresh air. Admission into the monument is free, but probably will have to wait to go inside. The ticket issuer gives you a time when you go. Right by the Washington Monument there are plenty of other places you can visit. You can visit the World War II Memorial, The Lincoln Memorial, The Korean War Memorial, and The Vietnam Memorial. On the other site of The Washington Monument are Capitol Hill, The Supreme Court, The Library of Congress/Jefferson House, and The James Madison Library of Congress. For me, it was great being there.",November 2019,50,Washington Monument,go2philv,The Washington Monument
In my opinion this is the best of all the attractions that you can visit whilst in Washington. The views from the top are spectacular however be aware that tickets are required to go up the monument and that they go on sale ( they are free) at 8:30am each day but they do sell out quickly.,November 2019,50,Washington Monument,Ian R,Great
"I made an online reservation for $1.00, printed my ticket and booked an entry time for 10am. I went through security quickly and go up the elevator in about 70 seconds. Once you exit at the 500 ft level, you get to some great views of the US Capitol and the Lincoln memorial. The park ranger on hand was nice and answered any questions regarding the monument. Once you are done at the 500 ft level you walk down one flight of stairs and can line up to take the elevator down. This lower level has some very interesting displays about the Monument. When you go back down, the ranger will stop the elevator, dim the lights so you can see some interesting stones through the front and back of the elevator. This stop is pretty quick so unless your situated near the front or back of the elevator, you may not see the highlighted stones.",November 2019,50,Washington Monument,Christian_elpintor,Excellent attraction to visit in Washington DC.
I believe the zoo spends there money well on care of the animals and the area.  Nicely.,October 2019,50,National Zoological Park,frankie b,I was so excited to get to the zoo
"I have been to DC a couple of times but never made it beyond the national mall and museums until now.  I was a bit disappointed when I arrived...you just walked in, no welcome/greeter or anything (but no admission fee either so that's a plus) and several of the displays were closed or no animals in sight. But I kept walking and so glad I did, I got to see pandas in person and the orangutans were so fun to watch (playful when I was there).  I had an enjoyable time and walk and got a lot of great photos. I had dinner plans so did not eat onsite but there were a lot of places to grab food (including some kid friendly food that everyone would like). There is also a 7-11 across the street for snacks. I walked to the zoo from my hotel (Omni Shoreham) but if you are taking the metro to the zoo, a local said she recommends the (Cleveland Park stop) 1 past the Woodley Park/Adams Morgan stop so you are walking downhill vs.uphill (especially important if you plan to walk the entire zoo like I did).

Go straight to the Outwin 2019 American Portraiture Today. That is where those who won this years contest are displayed. I liked some and was bored by others (like the video of a woman banging a pole against the concrete step she is standing on) but overall a good selection. The best is by Carla Crawford. The Presidential portraits are cool. After that I got lost in the maze of this large building that is connected to the American Art museum in which there were freshly painted walls. They had not used VOC free paint and the fumes got to me. Didn’t love most of the art there. The large interior atrium is nice.

"I wanted to visit the National Portrait Gallery to see the portraits of the Obamas, but there is so much else to see there.  The floor where the presidents are is fascinating as you follow the presidents from Washington to President Obama, and you can, if you look closely, learn something new.  I had no idea that the portrait of President Nixon was done by Norman Rockwell.  It was well worth seeing President and Mrs. Obama's portraits.  They are outstanding.  I also liked the portrait of the women Supreme Court Justices.

Mrs. Obama's portrait was simply beautiful - exceeded my expectations from what I saw on TV and loved the entire president's gallery with each president in order. What a history lesson! I was amazed by how large the museum is...portraits, paintings, sculptures from every period of history. Because I was in meetings all day, I was only able to visit for 2 hours and did not have time to see everything. I could have spent at least double that amount of time in the museum and the gift shop.  If you are carrying a jacket or bag (like I was), there are convenient/free lockers for you to use (so you don't have to worry about walking through the museum with them).

I watched one young elephant pace nervously in a figure-8 formation with some kind of anklet attached to it. I saw another large male swaying back and forth, pacing, and just generally not well. While I understand and appreciate the Zoo’s intent to educate patrons about the elephants and their wild counterparts’ plight in Asia, there has to be a better way to do it. Watching these animals just stand there or pace or otherwise act unnaturally was incredibly upsetting.

The museum also hosts special exhibitions: there was one on photography showing when we visited.

I didn’t intend going here but I’m pleased I did. A good lesson in history which allows one to absorb by osmosis the significance of FDR to our history. It’s a peaceful place which encourages reflection.,September 2019,40,Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial,Berenice K,Worth a visit
"The Memorial is large in area - spread over 7 1/2 acres adjacent to the Tidal basin between the Jefferson and MLK Memorials.  It was dedicated in 1997 by President Bill Clinton. It traces through a sequence of four outdoor rooms, one for each of FDR's terms of office. We have visited his home and cemetery at Hyde Park NY, and wanted to experience his Memorial.  Unfortunately the waterfalls, a centerpiece of the ""rooms,"" were not in operation.  Along the tour, there are memorable FDR quotes strategically placed on the large stone walls.  Ironically as we entered, the first statue is of FDR in his wheelchair, a position he avoided in the public. This was added in 2001 to be inclusive by the National Organization on Disability.  Another statue later on is with him and his best friend Fala, a Scottish terrier. A single statue further on is of Eleanor, the only presidential memorial to depict a first lady. The stroll through the Memorial is quite beautiful next to the Potomac.",September 2019,50,Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial,Disneybus,"""A nation does not have to be cruel to be tough""- FDR"

"I had heard that the Sakamoto swim team from Maui, Hawaii was placed in the Smithsonian.

Who knew de Kooning did the Kennedy portrait?  The Clinton portrait by Chuck Close was very impressive.  But the Obama portrait by Kehinde Wiley stole the show.  Perfect.  It's a shame that they'll add one for 45.  Just saying.  Tons of other wonderful portraits that are laid out in an historical timeline.

"Located near the Lincoln Memorial, this is one of the best memorial/statues in Washington. The figures are life-like with the facial expressions giving you are real sense of the anguish of war.

Definitely worth seeing.",October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,Demonakis,One of the best monuments in Washington

The first time I saw these soldiers making their way through the brush.....it was a foggy, wet morning and so realistic it was eerie.No matter the season or the weather.....these guys are on patrol.

We love this museum and have gone several times and spent the whole day.  The kids love the interactive elements and were able to get a lot out of most of the exhibits.

The restaurant is also amazing.,March 2019,50,Museum of the Bible,elizabethwN4246GY,Really great experience for the whole family
Our two families with 8 kids 12 and under came thinking it was going to be a normal museum where we would look at many different Bibles in glass cases. We were blown away when we'd started level 3 for the complete Story through the bible experience. The kids learned so much and everything in the Bible came to life.,November 2019,50,Museum of the Bible,ruthl750,We thought it the kids would have a hard time.

"We (my wife and me, friends visiting, etc) have visited the memorial in the summer, winter and seasons in between. It always is an emotional experience.

We went to see the Zoo lights. We took a shuttle A circulator bus decorated for the holidays. It was fun and amazing to see the lights. The only animal awake was the Bison. We enjoyed the food truck selection if you wanted a nosh or snack.  the only thing the bus didn't give a time when it was going to leave on the way back. If the driver said something I couldn't hear over the screaming child getting off the bus. So we left the Zoo lights no bus back to  metro and no bus back to the metro station. It was a long walk back.with my husband with a cane a hurt knee no fun. I would come back to the zoo in the day time to see the animals.,December 2019,40,National Zoological Park,ErisShaw,Zoo Lights was so much fun
"We were at the zoo during Thanksgiving week.  We arrived at the park shortly after opening.  There were no animals on display.  Literally, we saw a zebra, two cats, and after standing in the cold for 30 minutes we saw 1 panda from a very far distance.  We went into the panda observation area and saw one through the glass enclosure.  The elephants were in their enclosure everytime we went back to view them. We didn't try to explore any futher.

This is such an important memorial to the Vietnam veterans and to those still MIA.  I don't have a family member honored here but still found the directories of those honored important to look at. The sheer number of endless pages of names is enough to remind you of the losses from this war. I was with my 19 year old niece and I think those directories were a good start to understand this wall. We happened to be there as Christmas wreaths were laid by the panels and stopped to look at a Christmas tree filled with homemade decorations from groups honoring veterans. ,December 2019,50,Vietnam Veterans Memorial,MariaWaltham,Wreaths at memorial

"I have visited DC many times over the years but for some reason never went to the Library of Congress. Even the line to get in was a little different that many of the other attractions in the capitol, filled with mostly older folks, few kids.

"Amazing museum - definitely do not miss it. It gets crowded - even in the off season. There is a lot to read and see. Probably best not for young children too, though the few we did see were very well behaved. The museum goes through the rise of Hitler and Nazis through the Holocaust, death camps, and the end of the war. Some parts are so graphic they have concrete walls providing a visual barrier between the films and photos and people in case you don't want to witness it. Take your time and be respectful. This is not something to miss, nor is it a social media opportunity. Learn from it and don't forget.",November 2019,50,United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,emilymarcus,Absolutely Amazing - Very Important Not to Miss

I took my teenage children to the gallery when we visited Washington DC. It was a beautiful building filled with beautiful works of art.

"How you you review somewhere that commemorates such a dark time in the history of humanity? I genuinely feel this is somewhere that you should visit if you want to go to learn and hear firsthand accounts of that dreadful time. This is not somewhere to visit on a whim  or to fill time on a wet afternoon. I learnt so much and had my views challenged. I learnt how the Jewish people became historically ostracised. Informed about how Hitler and the Nazis came to power.I was moved to tears by the room of shoes and the audio and visual testimonies of survivors. In awe of the bravery of people who tried to help Jewish refugees. Amazed by the little boats of Denmark who put to sea to evacuate their Jewish people to Sweden. Astounded by the nations who stood by and did little or nothing to help evacuate Jewish people before Hitler implemented his ‘Final  Solution’. I spent the day here and could go back. As I was coming to the end of my visit I came across an elderly gentleman sitting at a desk in one of the open hallways,  telling his story to a group of people. We were all spellbound. He and his family were rounded up towards the end of the war, most of his family were gassed as they arrived at Auschwitz. A few were selected to work. He endured death marches and forced labour camps.  As he finished his story I went to shake his hand. I tried to thank him for sharing his story but no words would come. He looked me in the eye held onto my hand and smiled gently. A moment I will never forget.  My words do not do the Memorial museum any justice.

The real attraction is the building itself which we recommend a guided tour.  You will see rooms, statues and stain glass windows which are magnificent.  If you know in advance you are going to Washington, DC, you can arrange the tour through your Congressman rather than wait for a public tour.  It was a wonderful day.

"I really enjoyed this monument. It is something you read about for years and now having finally seen it was amazing. The park rangers walk around and have a wealth of knowledge. You will see that the two walls come together with the dates 1959 and 1975. This is to show that the war had come full circle and show that the first death was tied to the last date. You will notice next to each name there will be one of three symbols. Most have a diamond which represents they died in Vietnam. One is a cross that represents they went to Vietnam and never returned and are presumed dead. The last started as a cross and became a diamond with a cross in the middle. This represents someone who went to Vietnam and did not come home. Since the wall has been built, they have been found dead and this was the best way to represent the passing without making a new wall. Amazing. If you have questions the park rangers were great.

Disappointingly, there isn't really anything to see here in terms of interesting artifacts on display and I certainly wouldn't recommend the tour, which was rather insipid and added nothing to the experience.

It's not possible to visit this Memorial without being moved. I was so shocked with the number of panels and how many names there were on every panel. What is also interesting is the story behind how the memorial was approved and designed. It's a sad story about our government officials not wanting to support a memorial and apparently it was finally approved but with such tight limitations such as it can't be noticeable which is why the design of it is basically below the surface of the ground so if you're standing at a distance you don't actually see it.,October 2019,50,Vietnam Veterans Memorial,dawnbunatova,Touching

As you advance up ramps, you view exhibits on slavery in various parts of the U.S., the Civil War, Reconstruction, the Civil Rights movement, and present day. There are many items to view, explanatory notes, charts, and videos. I liked that young people were cautioned not to run and play on the ramps and mezzanines, because the material deserves attention. The contemplation room is amazing, with water falling from the ceiling, and inspirational quotes on the walls. The design of the museum makes it unlike any other I've visited.

The hallways are narrow and there is really no turning back once you embark on the tour of the museum.

"I recently visited this museum during a very busy time. It is a striking building from the outside especially. When you enter the museum, it is a large area with many possible ways to go and the signage could be more clear. If you want to see the main exhibits, find your way to the line for the large elevator that takes groups down to the lowest level where the earliest chronological exhibits are and walk from there to higher levels. There is so much to see as is the case with most museums. There is an exhibit honoring Emmit Till with his original casket but this exhibit is very crowded and not very well managed: there is a line that wraps around the corner for entrance to see this exhibit but this isn’t clear and there isn’t a museum employee standing at the entrance so many people drift in without realizing there is a line. This is frustrating when it could be easily addressed. There was an employee IN the exhibit area but seemed clueless in how to keep people moving smoothly through. One recommendation: there is a reflection room with the fountain that can be seen outside the museum pouring from the ceiling down.

"I traveled to Washington D.C. specifically to see Skylab 4, the Apollo space capsule flown into space to the Skylab space station and returned to earth by astronauts Carr, Gibson and Pogue.  It is a historical artifact which I wanted to see.  The museum was packed with children and I had to fight my way through the crowd looking for the capsule.  I could not find it so I went to the front desk where no one seemed to have ever heard of it.  One person at the desk (there were four, all of whom were clueless) said: ""Oh, there is some more space stuff over there.""  I searched again and still could not find it.  I brought up a picture of it on my cellphone and showed the people at the help desk.  One said: ""Oh, that thing, it was hanging in the room they are renovating; I think it's in storage.""  So I left disappointed having wasted a trip and an afternoon.  If you want to see history go to the annex at Hazy-Udar and skip the chaos of the downtown museum.  There are only a couple of things worth seeing, you can see them in the lobby (the Bell X-1, the Spirit of St. Louis, Friendship 7) and if they would move these to Hazy-Udar they could close the downtown museum and no one would even notice.",October 2019,10,National Air and Space Museum,Linebacker1952,Not worth the time or effort.
"We are both aviation buffs so this museum was high on our must see list. It was slightly disappointing that it is currently under renovation and some sections are closed but we enjoyed it anyway. In the queue to board at Heathrow, a fellow passenger had  commented that he wondered what the Wright brothers would make of an A380. We visited the section on the Wright brothers and wondered exactly the same. Little did they know what their efforts would lead to. The museum was crowded but not uncomfortably so when we went. We were pleasantly surprised to find that there were suitable lunch options available for vegetarians in the cafe, in fact we found it one of the easiest places in the city to eat. well worth a visit.",October 2019,40,National Air and Space Museum,JEBLLB,An interesting half day

Since I arrived early, I was able to get into any early group tour which consisted of ten people. Before the actual tour, you will see a short 12 minute video in a theater. The tour guide will give you headphones. The tour guide also stressed that no one wander away from him during our tour so as to avoid being scolded by the Capitol's security guards. The tour itself is about 45 minutes and very informative. Once the tour ends you can spend more time in the visitor center. There are plenty of bathrooms and a nice gift shop.

"We stayed in this museum from open 10 am to close 5:30 pm and still feel the need to go back and delve into it some more. Heard from some ""locals"" that you need three visits to really appreciate & digest all the information presented in such a unique way. Level C-1 (bottom floor) will take your breath away---the most comprehensive collection of slavery artifacts and information in one place anywhere in the world. So much to comprehend, so much to learn. The only disappointment in the museum is the cafeteria. Since we spent the entire day inside, we went there for lunch. Everything we ordered was overcooked, dry and seemed like it had been sitting in a tray for hours. Two small black bean empanadas, one small scoop of potato salad and a glass of iced tea was $20!!!

There was a long line to enter the museum, but it moved very quickly and we waited less than 15 minutes to get in.

I waited in the Ag Southern for nearly 30 minutes only to find out they didn't have chicken breasts,  only thighs and legs,  in case you don't like those pieces.  The other lines weren't as long.

The suggestions to give yourself a half to a whole day to thoroughly enjoy the exhibits are not an exaggeration. There's a lot of history and detail to take in. In order to truly appreciate it all, you don't want to feel rushed. This museum will awaken a number of profound emotions in all kinds of people from various backgrounds.

"This museum is still in such high demand that even during ""low season"" on a weekday with a much smaller than usual crowd......it is impossible to spend as much time or get close enough to see everything I wanted to see. Without a doubt you cannot experience the entire museum in a quality way in just one day. The lower levels designated ""History Galleries"" are the main draw and even though crowds are ""managed"" the passageways and rooms are still packed. Exhibits can be seen and appreciated but not always ""studied in depth"" due to crowds. We were there for 2 and a half hours and I only covered Level C3 and C2 in depth. But the information and experience is SO powerful....more than 3 hours might be overload. We did not make it to the upper galleries with culture and community so we have a reason to go back. DEFINITELY check online for reservations as soon as you know the dates you'll be there and I HIGHLY recommend a weekday if possible. I salute the sponsors of this wonderful and long overdue tribute.

"We were unable to get advance tickets, but walked up to the gate the day of and were told we could get tickets and go right in!   The museum had three levels underground that were dark and oppressive to give the visitor the same feeling the slaves felt when travelling the middle passage in boats.  As you went higher up through the museum, the rooms became brighter and progress was seen such as the first African American president.  Overall, the museum makes you face the reality that millions of ppl were torn from their homes in Africa and treated like livestock for European settlers and farmers gains.  Even after the civil war, they were treated as secondary citizens and thus, it has never been easy to get ahead.  We need to learn from this history and understand this country still has a long way to go.  The top floor has a wonderful exhibit on African American musicians, don't miss it.

We'd visited the old location a few years ago, and he was so excited to see this expanded museum and all the exhibits it has to offer.  He was particularly entranced by the Enola Gay and the Space Shuttle Discovery, but the entire museum was mesmerizing.  One tip for visitors would be to take your lunch break early if you plan on eating on-site as a McDonalds is the only option.  Waiting until the normal lunchtime means long lines and lack of tables.",October 2019,50,National Air and Space Museum,Arleene W,Fabulous exhibit
"It's a pretty cool museum and I think it's really neat, especially the planetarium which is basically mind-blowing.

"Went to DC with friends and we all picked an visit.  The Holocaust Memorial was my choice and it exceeded my expectations.  You can’t visit without being affected by the personal stories and connection the Memorial makes.   While it has been around for quite a while, it is timeless in its impact.  We were there for over 3 hours and could have stayed hours more.  While we didn’t rush through, I wish we spent even more time in each area.

Tip: If you're visiting the capitol take a cab.  They will drop you off in front of the building.

This and the portraits were most emotional for me.  I just wish it had not have been so crowded.  I ""got it"", I mean where the designers of the museum were going.

"Instead of writing about the subject matter, which the museum clearly presents in a thought-provoking way, I want to mention an aspect that I've never experienced in other museums that I've visited in the US, Middle-East, Europe and Asia, and that includes the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem.  The designers of this museum made the visit ""personal"".  For example, you are invited to pick up an Identity Card which is like a passport describing an actual person who died in the Holocaust.  It shows a picture of the person, describes the person's background as a regular person living a normal life (like ours) and then what happened to that person during the war.  There were also two passageways in which photos of the victims are hung up covering both sides of the walls - these were again normal portraits of people  living their lives.  It was a reminder, for me anyway, that these were not nameless victims; the experience invited me to feel their presence and the kinship as fellow human beings.  The interior structure of the museum is made of steel beams and other symbols creating that pervasive feeling of grim reality (to say the least).  Yet, in spite of all these, I came out feeling inspired - that it's our individual responsibility to preserve and even defend independent thinking, and not let others think for us, and that we keep our eyes and heart open.",December 2019,50,United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,DanielleHK1978,Thoughtful Design of the Holocaust Museum

My husband and I agreed that this war memorial is truly haunting. It is so realistic that you almost expect the soldiers to speak.,October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,Wing_anda_Prayer1210,Most moving of the war memorials
"This is a poignant and haunting memorial - particularly if you go at night. The soldiers are so realistic. If this memorial doesn't tug at your heartstrings, I fear you have no humanity or appreciation for the struggle and sacrifice of these brave men.",October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,wahoowa1213,Very poignant
Lovely view.of D.C. area in a historic monument.  Need to get tickets in advance or in the morning because there is a limit on number of visitors that are let in each day.,November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,suesilverthorn1,Great view in a historic monument.
"Even if you've been there several times, the walk up the steps and then the view of Lincoln is still a very moving experience. An absolute must when you are at the Mall. Everyone still reads his words and though there are a lot of selfies, the Memorial still inspires some awe. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial -- the wall -- is just to the right as you face the Lincoln Memorial. Two very inspiring places.",October 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,RonL40,One of the most moving memorials anywhere
Highly recommend a visit if you’re in DC. Enjoy your trip!,October 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,avorajee,Awe inspiring and majestic. A historical delight!
"We visited in the evening when it was dark the building is beautifully lit, and it’s not difficult to access, there’s a ramp to the side and a lift from a small museum that gives information on the build over all and the historic moments that have happened at the structure. Quite a site to see in real life well worth the visit!",December 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,trevort808,An impressive structure
What a great place to visit for the monument and to share an important part of Americana with many others.  Just a awesome experience.,December 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,22explorer22,Americana at its best
If you make the effort to go the the Vietnam Veterans Memorial then do yourself a favor and walk the 5 minutes across the National Mall to see this one. It is quite the special place and the platoon of soldiers walking through the terrain just speaks for itself.,October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,gerardmW7699SY,A must see
Incredibly moving. The horror or war made real. It does not glorify the war but does glorify the combatants.,October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,JohnSFleet_Hants_UK,Moving
"I also suggest to come in spring, summer or beginning of fall, cause in winter the bushes don't have any green on them and it doesn't look as ""realistic"".",October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,Tattykas,My favorite Memorial
I didn’t take photos out of respect. ,October 2019,40,Korean War Veterans Memorial,Liz J,Memorable and thought provoking 
"If you are at the Mall area you really must stop and see the Korean War Memorial. What a beautiful tribute. To look at the faces on the different statutes is really something else. Additionally, the wall behind it with the etching on it is really beautifully done. ",September 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,254tashak,Must see 
"It was pretty cool taking pictures at the Memorial. Lots of walking, but lots of great photo opportunities. Don't miss the exhibits on both sides of the memorial.",August 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,Melissa G,Lincoln Memorial
"The Lincoln Memorial is just off Constitution Ave, so start at the Washington Monument, head west towards the World War II Memorial.  Then walk past the reflecting pod to the Lincoln Memorial.  At the top of the steps you will see a magnificent likeness of Lincoln, wait your turn then get close for some pictures.  When finished head down the steps where they have artifacts and great bathrooms.  You can do all of this in just a few hours.  Don't worry about the crowds everyone is very courteous.",November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,David P,A must do in DC
After a lovely Walk along the National Mall the Lincoln Memorial looms on the horizon. It's one of those moments when you realise how big something is in real life! There are a lot of steps to climb to reach the top but there is also a (very old but safe) lift if the steps are too much. Totally worth it! A great way to learn more about the history of the US. ,October 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,SnowQueen59,History and grandeur
"This memorial is a must see for anyone visiting Washington. It is beautiful,  historic,  and offers a beautiful view of the reflecting pools, Washington monument and Capitol building.  I would recommend two visits, one in the day, and the other at night. It offers two different perspectives. ",December 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,H-Tan-H-Epi-Tas,Historic sight
"As the pictures show it can get very busy but once you climb those steps, you have a beautiful view of the memorial mall. It is such an interesting piece of history (one of many in dc) that you must visit. Just take your time with the walking as things appear closer than they are",May 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,Mark W,Jaw dropping and stunning 
The Memorial is an outstanding visit both emotionally as well visual. The Korean war was not taught when I was in school and this fills in a lot of questions I have had. A well done tribute.,October 2019,40,Korean War Veterans Memorial,TCzones,A must see Memorial
"Its beautiful.  Something u have to see for yourself , ",October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,piper77,Amazing 
Seeing the many soldiers with different expressions and jobs is awesome. This was one of the memorials I wanted to see most and it did not disappoint. It is within close walking distance to the Lincoln memorial. This is very well done. ,October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,Russell3939,A must
There happened to be a light rain when we went to visit and it really made the statues come to life even more.  ,October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,AAS,Moving
A profoundly simple memorial to those veterans of the Korean War. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the artist's vision. Striking and well executed.,September 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,MomtoSam166,Striking memorial...
Loved this marvel close to the white house. It has abraham lincoln sitting on a chair and staring at the lake.,November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,Laks V,Worth the visit
"Just awe inspiring to say the least. From the bike ride next to the reflecting pool through fall colored trees (ok, not all year but...) to the steps and then finally the monument itself. A must see for anyone visiting DC. ",November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,robertmphotography,One of the highlights of our trip!
"We went at night while it was lit. It was a stop on a tour bus, well worth the $$, especially in the cold temperatures. The National Mall at night is beautiful.",December 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,Tommy C,Night tour is way to go
"Despite the heat and the crowds, you can't visit DC without a stop to see the Lincoln Memorial sitting at the top of the Reflecting Pond with the Vietnam, Korean War and WWII memorials nearby.  ",August 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,stevelotte,A Must for Everyone
This was the wow factor when I saw Lincoln. It was just like the pictures but just more impressive in person,December 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,lisasA8353ZB,First visit
Saw this during a day tour and it was impressive.  Seeing it again at night was even better.  The layout is completely unique for a memorial.,October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,Tonyb38633,Nice day or night.
"I recommend that everyone not only visit this memorial during the day, but be sure to return after dark and you will see and appreciate it in a whole new prospective. In the dark it truly looks like these brave soldiers are rising up coming toward you!",May 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,B1328IUlindal,Never Forget these brave men and women
It is very impressive to see this memorial and think of all the people who died in this war. The statues of soldiers walking in the bush give you an impression of what they had to go through,September 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,Piet K,Very impressive
"We stopped on the hop on hop off night tour and the statues were intriguing, ghostly and beautiful. Not to be missed",November 2018,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,mlbdab,Hauntingly beautiful 
"There are a number of elements to this memorial, but what stands out are the statues of soldiers on patrol. The faces are haunting -- young men walking into the unknown. It's impossible to avoid comparing this monument to the Vietnam wall. I've always seen the Vietnam memorial as being about loss, whereas the Korean memorial can be about whatever you want it to be: loss, bravery, victory, teamwork (there are markers for all 22 nations who sent troops to Korea), or people doing a dangerous job under difficult circumstances. Korea has always been a forgotten war, so as the son of a Korean War veteran I'm glad to see this impressive tribute to those who served.",October 2019,50,Korean War Veterans Memorial,VikingVikingViking,Beautiful tribute to those who served
Went on a nighttime monument tour while on vacation in DC.  I would strongly recommend visiting all the memorials at night first and return in day if you want more time.  The Lincoln at night was amazing and the right way to round out the tour; you also visit the WW II memorial which is also great at night.,November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,559briank,Lincoln Memorial at Night
We loved the writings inside to remind us of how far we've come and how far we have yet to go. Stunning views of the reflecting pool and monument. ,November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,AmesnBru,Stunning masterpiece
We took the evening to drive in and through DC.  Plan parking in advance and walk the grounds in and around the White House and mall area. It’s HUGE!  Quite impressed.   Officers everywhere are very helpful with directions and or parking. ,November 2019,40,Lincoln Memorial,mikenmelz,On our way to FL
Well worth a visit. There is an elevator for visitors with mobility issues. Very moving to see the speeches and inscriptions on the wall behind the statue.,November 2019,40,Lincoln Memorial,Clucksy,Very moving
Like all of central Washington this is beautiful to behold . We were very impressed. As a capital city it is so splendid.,November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,ricky39,Spectacular views
"A huge stone carving of Lincoln is housed in a Greek style temple in memory of his accomplishments in uniting the nation after the Civil War. There are restrooms to the left of the bottom steps. Just be aware, adjacent to the restrooms are more displays of Lincoln’s writings. We visited on a weekday morning where the crowd was surprisingly sparse and plenty of photo ops abound.

"This is hands down my favorite monument!!! I've always loved Lincoln so that may have something to do with it!! Super cool to stand on the exact spot where MLK Jrs ""I Have a Dream"" speech! ",May 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,rdburrows,He's Massive!!!

Make sure you don't miss the place where Martin Luther King delivered his I have a dream speech. It is commemorated with a tile on the floor near the entrance of the memorial. Most people.missed it whilst we were there. The view across the reflecting pool to the monument is also impressive from the top of the memorial steps.,October 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,Cruiser31690,Impressive inperson

Never been in Washington DC and of course never at Lincoln M. But I liked that very much and I breathed the spirits of states founders and activists. Great panorama and sunny days. I liked it. ,November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,edmondoangelaccio,Very interesting place 
What is listed in the topic area was exactly what my 12-year old daughter said after reading the great words of one of the most incredible leaders of our nation- a divided nation. If you are able to- take a tour with a park ranger many valuable nuggets of information. ,November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,dannygoya2012,Wonder what Lincoln is thinking about our nation today 
I loved walking up the stairs to the inner walls to read and take in the history The view from the top of the Stairs is amazing It is a must if in DC,September 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,Mr. R,Amazing
Amazing . Elevator to statue if you can't walk the stairs. Other memorials within walking distance. Great view of the relection pond and Washington Monuement.,November 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,jakequacker,Veterans Day Visit to DC
Take time to read the inscriptions on the walls. The climb will get your blood moving. It is worth it though. ,October 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,HALjunkie,Must See
This was the first monument we visited after checking in to our hotel.  Two days later we took a tour and visited it at night. On both occasions it was awe inspiring.,October 2019,50,Lincoln Memorial,JEBLLB,Unmissable
