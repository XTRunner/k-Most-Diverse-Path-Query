JHughes50,Go to the visitor center worth paying to park. ,"We wanted to take a short hike while visiting Torrey Pines. I highly recommend paying the fee to park near the visitor center. Why hike up a hill to get to the trails and exhaust yourself before you start. I believe I would not pay, only if we wanted to go to the beach below. Parking is also scarce before you enter. At the visitor center they recommended a trail, as we wanted to spend only an hour or two. The center is informative as well; try to watch the short video. The views are spectacular, but be warned that it is very open and desert-like, with very few trees for shade. We thought pines would be all over, but Torrey pines like to be “alone” perse.

Bobolina2014,Wonderful Tour of an Amazing Structure,"We had a group tour and the docent was an experienced architect who brought the entire  facility to life for us. Louis Kahn's collaboration with Jonas Salk resulted in an impressively functional structure and workplace for world class scientists, and a strikingly beautiful complex set on the cliff above La Jolla bay. We most highly recommend seeing this.",50,Salk Institute,February 2019

Dana S,Best Architecture in San Diego,"Beautiful architecture by Louis Kahn, beautiful to see, especially as close to sunset as you can visit, best in winter because you can see a sunset before they close the grounds to visitors at 5:30pm daily",50,Salk Institute,December 2017

Michael W,Its a bridge.,"So, we went over this bridge on the trolley bus tour. Its perhaps a 5 minute ride to Coronado. The views of SD are good although there is definitely no stopping. The road itself is a little disconcerting.... Its 2 lanes each way with a concrete dividing central reservation. And on the outside.... there is a line of concrete blocks.!",40,Coronado Bridge,September 2019
MarkR205,Interesting museum,I really found it interesting looking around San Diego Old Town even though it is all rebuilt due to fire. There is a good mix of museum type exhibits and shops.

ERICW755,"Backwater Trail in La Jolla, Great Views and A Bit of Adventure","The entrance of this trail is 'hidden' but not really, one must simply know where to look.  I have provided the address as close as possible on Google Maps and a screen shot.  Upon writing this review the lot next to the entrance is under construction so the entrance doesn't look the same.  Apparently this trail is frequented often despite some being overly cautious and not wanting to disrupt the locals...I say this is hooey because this rich folk have plenty of land and people looking to hike are not going to disrupt them one bit.  This trail was established (so I've heard) by stoners and surfers alike and is pretty interesting to descend.  There is evidence of extensive use of this trail to enter Black's Beach, a notorious nude beach in La Jolla just below the Glider Port, and is very scenic and interesting.  When descending the path there were a few 'sticky areas' as I brought my nice camera and wanted to be careful not to eat it while going down the path.  It takes about 15-20 minutes to get down depending on your speed and willingness to take risk, but overall it was a cool experience and would definitely recommend to anyone that they should check it out once.",40,Ho Chi Minh Trail,July 2014
AZSMF,OUCH $$$,"most excellent shopping and dining up and down as long as you don't forget your wallet. the wife and kids love the shops, me, the food. Can't go wrong here and it's kind of a must see area, everyone will find something they want",50,Girard Avenue and Prospect Street,August 2016
jerryssobel,Nice walk with zillions of stores that all look alike though,"To begin with, I am not a shopper. We went from our hotel in old town to just stretch our legs. It was very easy to park.

Store 1 and store 999 had very  same selections though",40,Old Town San Diego State Historic Park,August 2019
treyk453,San Diego beach that reminded me of an east coast beach.,"We spent a few lazy hours catching some rays with the kids here. Parking was easy. The walk to the beach was short. The beach wasn't overcrowded. The weather is perfect. There was a ""boardwalk"" that reminded me of beaches on the east coast. If you like the beach, you will enjoy yourself here.",50,Mission Beach,March 2019

cohoman,Fine for killing time - Not that special,"My family walked along Prospect Street after viewing the La Jolla Cove area. There are lots of small shops, various eateries and ice cream shops. There are also some high end stores (e.g., Kate Spade) in the area. Sort of reminded me of a mini Rodeo Drive. Not all that special, but might be a good thing to checkout after visiting La Jolla Cove to kill some time.",30,Girard Avenue and Prospect Street,July 2016
147kerenb,Pretty place,"A lovely place to walk for a couple of hours. Lots of atmosphere and character. San Diego is a very busy place.

BrianC867,"Bars, bars, and more bars.","If you're into drunken college age kids and public urination, then this is going to be the place to go.

Sarg33388,Must see!,"When we got out of our car, the first thing we saw was a group of sea lions about 30 feet from is lounging in the sun. Be sure to go at low tide so that you can peek in the tide pools. There is a small cave/rock passage that you can pass through at low tide. Be aware that the walkway is under construction and the path includes lots of stairs.",50,Shell Beach Tide Pools,December 2014
Elvis M,Lots of shops and places to eat,"Stayed overnight at a hotel nearby. This area is full of upscale shops, chains and boutiques.

vagabondginger,Historic Building,"Not only are there changing exhibits of local artists works but the renovation of this space is also worth seeing. On Sept 29 I attended an opening reception for a special exhibition of The Studio Door's Studio Artists which is in Hillcrest so it was Uptown Meets Downtown at the Sparks Gallery. This will be displayed until January 5, 2020 on the 2nd floor mezzanine level. The Sparks Gallery original wood floor and brick walls and glass windows really showcase what a gem this building is. It's a perfect venue for special events as well as the art work. It's best to check out their website to arrange a visit.",50,Sparks Gallery,September 2019
Bandit2118,Awesome Admiration,"Oh the Pacific is so pretty and this spot is so perfect for taking photos, watching people, and swimming/wading water before the tide rolls in to beat up on the rocks. When tide is out, you can walk many of the rocks and admire crabs and beautiful fish. Sitting on the beach is awesome as you see the true beauty and power o the Pacific. Also, there is a large rock where a lot of sea lions congregate and chill out/play. One day we saw several guys snorkeling and they stated they were looking for lobster nests. Wow. You do not realize how much there is to see here and the beauty of it all is overwhelming. There was an artist here every morning of our stay to catch much of this beauty. Enjoy Shell Beach Tide Pools in La Jolla Cove!",50,Shell Beach Tide Pools,October 2013
Lynma1959,great for a sunset,"pretty sunset pictures here, must see if in Lajolla. Shell Beach resort is long gone and a new hotel in there but still a very nice place to sit and watch the sunset! Sea lions and sea gulls are always there. Wear your sneakers lots of walking",50,Shell Beach Tide Pools,October 2014
lindymiles,For tourists who like high-end merchandise,"Even though we live only 20 minutes away, my spouse and I enjoy strolling along Girard and Prospect Streets because the shops are always getting new and interesting merchandise. For instance, the floral shop on Girard had some of the most unusual, lovely proteas we had ever seen on display. I can always find the perfect gift in Warrick’s Bookstore nearby. I have bought charming stocking stuffers such as miniature purse-size staplers and 3-D bookmarks and tiny transformer characters. I have even bought purses and costume jewelry there. You will want to spend more than the 2-hour parking allotment if this is your first visit to La Jolla, so try parking in one of the parking garages—a good underground one is on Fay Avenue near Prospect Street.There are so many great places to eat at various prices it is hard to recommend just one or two. We like Rappongi above this parking garage for lunch and dinner and Richard Walker’s on Prospect for breakfast. Another favorite lunch spot is the Girard Gourmet where we indulge in deli dishes and terrific pastries. There are nice art galleries all over La Jolla but especially on Prospect.  I feel as if I am in a wealthy shopping district in Italy or Paris when I stroll these streets.",50,Girard Avenue and Prospect Street,November 2015

tlyntp,My summer favourite,"I love PB - but Mission Beach takes the cake for me. It's clean, quite and great waves. Parking is not so great - as in most places - but if you come down enough you know the times that are best to park - OR if you have patience or good luck, you will find the right spot and enjoy your day! There are a lot of spots you have to walk down hill to get to the beach - some down steps and some just the hill, some beaches here are easier access. It's a great place to stay and enjoy the day - usually pretty calm even in the midst of summer.",40,Mission Beach,August 2018

TJFLG42,Amazing Architecture and History,"After Jonas Salk invented the polio vaccine, he wanted to create a world-class research institute where researchers from various fields could work and collaborate.

That's a vacation!",50,Salk Institute,July 2014
Kathy S,"Wonderful large grassy area, not much more","There isn't much to this park other than a huge grassy area with a couple of trees, overlooking the ocean.

pattie76,Photographic Art at Its Finest,"We happened upon this lovely gallery when we took the wrong way from our hotel on our way to grab a Dood's Burger.  I was initially captivated by one of the framed canvases showcased in the window when a friend of the owner invited us in.  Upon entrance we were greeted by a large display of photographs unlike any I have previously viewed, as well as the creator of these wonderful prints Michael Slattery.  My husband became engaged in conversation with Slattery as I wandered from print to print trying to find the one that best captured my imagination.  I could go on and on about his interesting technique, but it is one that is best viewed by one's own eyes.  I found my soul in a print called I.B. Pier, can you find yours?  If you can't visit San Diego your best bet is to shop his online site:  luminous-views.com",50,Luminous Views Gallery,February 2015

galcurious,Ion Theater Co. is Amazingly Good Theater!!!,"Ion Theater Co. is a small theater production company in Hillcrest, San Diego, CA right near Balboa Park and in the effervescent community of Hillcrest and near the Bankers Hill neighborhood. The theater holds maybe 50 people at most and every seat puts you right in the middle of the action.  I first saw their production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" when they were doing their plays in a storage park in Mission Valley but then in 2008 they moved because the landlord was a Prop. 8 supporter.  Since then, at their Pennsylvania & 6th Ave. locations, my husband and I have see at least 5 plays and they've all been good. They've been doing a lot of dystopian plays which have been doing well after the 2016 election in our neck of the woods. Always good plays at reasonable prices and every one has been excellent.  So if you're here in SD for a week or a weekend or you live here year-round, check out this theater!",50,Ion Theater,September 2017

When he got close enough to understand, i was informed that children have to be 16 to enter the sauna....i ask him where the sign stating that was..and was told ...we are working on it and it is not healthy for children to be in there. Now they spent alot of money to rehab this pool and i guess they had no more for a sign...or a polite employee to explain it. Funny..i always thought saunas were healthy.My sons and i decided to leave and was informed that where i had been sitting was for members only. I had been sitting there 3 hours and not once did an employee inform me that i was sitting in a members only area...just embarrassed me to my sons ...i asked again...where is the sign stating ..MEMBERS ONLY AREA...no such sign exist... So they may have spent alot of money on rehab...but not on employee training..especially the area of courtesy..for $36. i would think i was a member for the day...guess not...and now..i never will be.

Don C,Great Concert Series,"This concert series was started in 2003 and has presented performers from all musical genres. From the Strawbs to Dan Hicks. John Sebastian to Led Kaapana. Most recently we saw Karla Bonoff and Nina Gerber. Before that Rodney Crowell. Coming soon is John Sebastian. From the well known, to the should be and soon will be we, well known. What I like about this is that people go there to listen to the music. Not to be seen or talk on their cell phones. Most concerts have an intermission where the artist will come out and talk with you and sign CDs etc. Where else can you find that?

racite,Cute store in San Diego (little Italy),"If you are already in Little Italy drop in for a few minutes as this store has interesting tidbits to look at. I bought a fragrance lamp here about five years ago and I return periodically to buy refill fragrance for it (my favorite is red current). The selection of lamps change frequently. Sometimes the lamps are really nice sometimes just so so, it's really all about timing if you are looking for one. If you are in the market for an authentic Italian mask then this is your store they seem to have a consistent selection of those.  I also like the jewelry here as they are from artists that have a unique and modern aesthetic. I wouldn't describe this as a ""destination"" store but if you are in the vicinity be sure to drop in.",30,Masquerade Art of Living,August 2016

JTfromSoCal,Scenic views,We have been to San Diego numerous times but this was the first time we went to Point Loma. The view from there is beautiful. We visited the Cabrillo National Monument and the lighthouse. In the lighthouse you can go upstairs and see the living quarters of the family that lived there. You can see the garden where they would grow their own produce. You can go to the visitor center to learn more about the place and there's a nice gift shop too. There are nice walking trails too. It's a good place to go especially when the weather is great.,40,Point Loma,May 2018

GlobalGypsy_13,Place for all Seasons,"Point Loma is more than a Lighthouse and a National Park at the tip.  You can walk along the ocean with paid admission to the national park during visiting hours.  Or you can walk along the San Diego bay at anytime -- day or night -- for free. Walking along the bay from Kellogg Beach (1 block off of Rosecrans at this cross street) to Shelter Is and back has become my daily ritual shared with dog walkers, a few bikers and a handful of runners.  For stunning bay views do try this flat walk; ample free parking is available on Shelter Island where you can find a cup of Joe at the Fuel Dock or a meal at anyone of the many hotels there.  .",50,Point Loma,August 2018

The USD Torero Stadium is a perfect place for the San Diego Legion to play. I had Parking at the Mission Parking Structure across from the stadium. As you enter the Stadium above the seating area outside of the beautiful Jenny Graig Pavilion, there are many vendors in booths  selling Food, Drinks, and Souvenir items. The 6,000 person seating areas in the Torero Stadium is just the right size for the San Diego Legion Rugby Team crowd. On one side of the stadium they have Plastic individual chair seats. On the end zone and other side of the stadium they just have hard concrete bench seats, so bring a pad to sit on. Also its hard to sit on the visitor side which is the VIP seating ?

Looking around Balboa Park, I didn't realize that the junior theater was actually a theater specifically for child performers and actors.  The ""Shrek the Musical"" was in production and I was delighted to know that they accommodated birthday parties.  20 of us kids and parents gathered to watch a brilliant cast of 8 through 18 year olds sing their hearts out.  They work on all the set design, costumes, everything!  It is really inspirational and a nice break from the norm of cell phones, TVs and tablets.  The full length production was a bit long for the 3 year old and 5 year old but they really enjoyed it.  As part of the birthday package, my son got to go on stage before it began and the entire audience sang happy birthday!  Then we had a back stage tour, all 20 of us.  Afterward we hung out under the trees of Balboa Park while eating sandwiches and cupcakes.",50,San Diego Junior Theatre,May 2014

I am a big fan of hands on adjustments, and there is always a fair share of those that are very supportive and exactly what my body needs. Nikki the owner is the sweetest girl in town and has truly cultivated such a welcoming and loving community. There is also so many different events happening each month including cacao ceremonies, live kirtan, breathwork workshops, and more!! And if this wasn't all epic and amazing, this studio donates a portion of its profits to different charities!!

They were all delicious.  Plus the tasting room is filled with fun games to play.  There were piles of board games and the wall was decorated with an elaborate rube goldberg machine.

Cary L,OK FOR A SHORT WALK OR RIDE,"It's great that the Otay River valley has been cleaned up and partly turned into a park, and trails are always welcome in an urban area. But the trails here are pretty mundane. Other than a couple of ponds, there are no real sights. Most of the trail routes are through high vegetation, some of which is interesting (see photos), but there isn't much to see or do along the way.

Dara S,Eh,"We stopped in this downtown San Diego venue near the Gaslamp District during happy hour. We were looking forward to doing some people watching from their sidewalk seating, but it actually wasn’t a very busy sidewalk. Service was kind of slow but our server was nice and smiled a lot. I got some below average wine but my boyfriend enjoyed his beer. We ordered some soft pretzels which my boyfriend loved – he wasn’t as much of a fan of the dip they came with (kind of like queso, kind of like sour cream), but I liked it. We both were craving the old standard, mustard. The fried calamari were perfect, tasty and not greasy. The marinara sauce they came with was pretty watery and flavorless though – the sweet and sour sauce was all right. This place was fine, but if we’d known about the restaurants we discovered during our walk after, I think we would have eaten somewhere on 5th between Market and Broadway.",30,Rock Bottom Brewery,March 2012

For the most part it did. We sat outside and had a few (very good) beers, and had some ""pub grub"" which was pretty much just that. Although the decor was very nice, lots of wood and very open, I couldn't get over how empty and dark it was inside. It seemed to be like a haunted place that chased people away. Again, I really did enjoy the beer (a bit too much), and I did not have any entrees, but I left wishing I'd liked it more for what it appeared to be at first.",30,Rock Bottom Brewery,August 2011

tim s,A great day in the mountains,"The noble canyon trail is a fantastic trail located in the Cleveland national forest.  The trail varies greatly depending of the time of season, so be prepared depend on the time of year.  Mountain bikers like this trail because its fast, but difficult.  Backpackers like it because of the wide variety of plants and creatures that can be seen. ( if you're quiet) and there's even and old gold mine to explore.  This is a point to point trail so many people take multiple cars...you know the drill.  I always go by myself and always start at the pine valley trailhead where you climb the first 1/4 mile then desend into Noble canyon.  The trail is 10 miles long with a 650 foot gain in elevation so I would list it as a moderately difficult hike.  Along the way you will pass through pine, sylan oak, manzanita, yucca and in the spring....wildflowers galore. You ford several small streams and you make the climb toward the big laguna meadow and I would definitely make this a whole day event.  To get there take  hwy 8 from san diego about 40 miles, get off at the pine valley exit and enter the hamlet of pine valley. Turn left onto old highway 80.  Go about one mile and make a very sharp right turn onto pine creek road and travel several miles till you see the trailhead signs on your right.  The trailhead has toilets and thats about it. It's a great way to spend a day!  Trees, small streams and lots and lots of quiet...except when the mountain bikers fly by! I'd recommend going early...spend the day and then finish off by stopping at the Alpine Beer Company pub for a cool drink and great food on your way back to san diego.",50,Noble Canyon,May 2015
venom034,Must ride MTB run,"One of the best runs in SoCal. Take two cars, stage one down in Pine Valley and then drive to the top. You can also park at the base and ride up via Sunrise Highway. Either way, it's an epic run. Technical switch backs, banked super turns, steep runs, single track and jeep trails. It has them all. If you are looking for a great ride, go for it! Definitely not for the beginner rider, but not too hard for your average biker. I prefer my hard tail, but a full suspension would be fine. Have fun!",50,Noble Canyon,May 2015
traveltoforeignlands,Theater with a Twist!,"I positively LOVE the Starlight Bowl!  Not only are their performances fantastic, but they are great fun to watch!  I love the theater--particularly song and dance musicals--but theater here should be called ""Theater with a Twist!""  The reason being that the Starlight Bowl is in the flight path of San Diego's Lindbergh field.  There are tiny lights on the stage and when an airplane's path is such that it will interrupt the sound of the musical, the lights turn red.  When the performers see the red lights, they immediately stop dancing and singing, and literally freeze in place!  When the lights return to green, they continue their song/dance without missing a note or a step.  It is truly amazing to behold!  There are some who do not appreciate this aspect and find it off-putting; for those, I suggest attending plays elsewhere as we have many wonderful theater venues throughout the County. That said, if you are looking for something a bit different, I think you will truly enjoy the experience.  I have returned to the Starlight again and again and yet never tire of the experience! :)",50,Starlight Bowl,June 2015
Walker S,Planes landing stops the show,The landing pattern for the airport is right over this outdoor theater.  The stage performance freezes during the time the plane noise interferes.

I liked 2/4 of my beers, but the wheat had a fairly pungent musty taste to it that I've never tasted in beer before while another one was only slightly less pungent. About 1/3 of their beers were out of stock. I enjoyed the brown a lot - had excellent notes of cappuccino and was very smooth. The nitro stout was a good end as well. This place has potential, but it does have some bad batches of beer. I was hoping for more because this place didn't seem to specialize in IPAs like every other brewery in San Diego and had a wide variety of beers, but when 2/4 are to the point where if I had a full pint I wouldn't have finished them, that's not good.",30,Quantum Brewing,February 2016

aimeekrishna,Go!,"Our family tried the Sunday evening service on our first go around and felt it was a bit too ""youthful?"".  I mean...my husband and I are only in our mid thirties, with two preteens, but somehow felt the crowd and vibe was a little too excitable.  It took us about a year of being church gypsies before he had a feeling that we should give a morning service at C3 a go.  I'm glad we returned before writing off churches in San Diego altogether.  This church is a God send!  The worship, pastors, message, youth program and child care is amazing!  All this bundled up with the ability to have a late start to a much desired lazy Sunday morning is sublime; plus our entire family agrees on a church ;)  I'm fairly certain that the Sunday evening service would be ""off the chain"", now that we've immersed ourselves in this church.  I can go on and on but I'll leave it at Thank you, Jesus, for leading us here!  Oh and ya', you should go!",50,C3 Church San Diego - Central Campus,March 2017

No crying at all. He was just playing on the floor. Once in a while he would coo. The people around him were enjoying him. Towards the end of the service, like 15 minutes left, a lady came and told us the baby was too loud. The babies mom grabbed him some cheerios and the box made some noise.

The worship team sounded amazing and sang such great contemporary Christian music to set the hearts into the right posture to then learn from an amazing and relevant, hard-hitting sermon.

There’re some big rocks in the property that serve as a natural climbing area and a non functioning tractor that kids can play with while the adults drink some nice cider.

Initially it was a disaster for them as they just couldn't stay up on the ice.  They were pleading to go.  Seeing as we had only been there 10 minutes, we wanted to try to get them to stay longer.  I went and rented these sleds (see picture-rent for $15/hr) that are the shape of a seal and one (or two small kids) can sit on and one can push.  After that it was all smiles and fun. My fearless 6 year old could have stayed all day.  There is a wonderful food court in the same building, upstairs from the ice arena.

Mark R,Disappointing Non-Visit,"As a former SDPD Officer, and now a federal working in DC, I wanted to visit the museum when on a trip to visit family. I checked the website, took note of operational hours, even emailed them . . . twice. NO response; should have been my first clue. I took my wife with me, eager to see what was included in the museum, use exhibits to share with her my years with the department. We arrived about ten minutes prior to advertised open hours . . . and waited. Opening time comes, no one. Check the door, locked; lights, off. Wait 15 minutes, still no one. 30 minutes, still no one. Check hours sign on door, yup, should be open. After 45 minutes waiting, and my wife getting understandably bored, we left. Now, I suspect the museum is all-volunteer which is fine, but if you're going to promote such then make that happen! Not even response to emails ahead of time . . . pretty ""disappointing"". I don't get to San Diego all that often, especially with time to visit, but this really needs to improve.",10,San Diego Police Museum,December 2015

jeh15343,Love!,"We are a household of proud police supporters and my five year old daughter is no exception. We decided to check out the history of the SDPD. This is a great little museum that touches on every bit of its history. There is no fee to get in, but they do take donations. They have a small gift shop as well with reasonably priced merchandise. This was loved by myself and my five year old. ",50,San Diego Police Museum,August 2015
sarahe832,Small but worth a visit,"When you enter you are welcomed by volunteers who are retired SDPD cops sat behind an old wooden station desk. The museum is small but full of informative exhibits & artefacts with lots of real police items donated by ex-cops & their families. They have a wall of remembrance & a wall of officers receiving bravery medals, each telling that officer's story & making the rest of the display all the more real. The volunteers were happy to answer all our questions & we could hear them chatting together & discussing their war stories as we went round the museum. They have a selection of patches & hats (including 9 from the UK) from police forces around the world which was cool to look at. Best of all this museum is free with free off road parking too! I was extra happy to find they sell sew on patches- a rare thing in UK museums these days but easier to find abroad. Nice little museum- if you are a cop, related to a cop or interested in the history of policing this is well worth a visit. ",40,San Diego Police Museum,March 2017

John J,Delightful experience,"A not-oft-performed opera, ""Murder in the Cathedral,"" was the reason for the trip, a Sunday afternoon performance.

scoresmore,Excellent production of a mediocre opera,"I was in San Diego for a conference, and one night went to the opera. I went to see Murder in the Cathedral... Ugh, what a mediocre work That being true, the production and singing were world class.  One thing that really angered me, however, was when I bought a ticket online, the company added an automatic donation... That's a crappy, misleading way to do philanthropy...",40,San Diego Opera,April 2013

",50,Rough Draft Brewing Company,September 2017
JamesR_MN,Excellent beer and good food,Rough Draft is a place to go if you want good beer and decent food. I have tried about 8-10 beers over several visits and they are typically on point for style and quite nice. They have several barrel aged beers which are strong but excellent. Food is typical bar food but it is quite tasty. They make good flatbreads with ample toppings. I have had several of the hot sandwiches and every one was good. Last one I had was the Po' Boy and the chicken andouille sausage was nicely spiced as was the sauce. The potato salad side is a nice change from the fries that are everywhere else. Great place to go for good beer and food and low prices make it easy to return.,40,Rough Draft Brewing Company,July 2018
Peregrin8or,Excellent beer with decent food,"I applaud them for having a kitchen since many craft breweries do not. However, the offerings are pretty basic burger and sandwich fare. It’s totally worth going just for the quality of their beer - particularly since their IPA’s are not blown out bitter bombs. It’s a nice industrial space to chill with friends while waiting for rush hour to die down.",40,Rough Draft Brewing Company,May 2019

sdbctb,Pier closed but surrounding area open,"the actual pier could not be walked on when we were there. but theres a small area to sit nearby and of course to go onto the beach, didn't seem the cleanest and there were no seals/sea lions there in august on a  Saturday afternoon. a bit disappointing walking down from the scripps aquarium to that. there is a pedestrian bridge with a viewing tower on the way and some nice grassy areas where there are nice views and can get some good pictures.

On a bright day (seems most of the time in beautiful San Diego :) ) the views are breathtaking. You can enjoy this from a small deck next to the pier which is opened to the public. You can also walk under the pier on the sand when the tide is low and it’s a very popular photo op spot. You can find side street parking along La Jolla Shores Drive and walk there.",40,Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier,November 2019

As with all Ballets, I think it would be wise for the spectator to know the story, otherwise you might/will be confused. Only part I hated of this choreographed performance was a completely random tap dancer thrown on in the midst of the show, isolated and included for zero reason. Dress nicely depending on the venue, Civic center was nice, great crowd, we were the youngest couple there but had a blast! ",50,California Ballet Company,April 2018

themotorcyclebeerman,"Cool location, Awesome Branding, So so beers!","Acoustic Ales Brewing is located in the old Mission Brewing building off the ""5"" near the San Diego airport.  The facility is very cool with some neat history.  The branding / name of the beers plays off of rock and roll music albums and bands.  The beer is just OK in my book.  The best that I tried was their ginger beer.  It was good but lacked some intensity compared to other ginger beers that out there.  Their Blonde had and left a strange after taste. The taproom attendant was nice and made the visit enjoyable.",30,Acoustic Ales Brewing,August 2017

I was pretty happy with most the choices as I felt that the beers I tried definitely represented their particular styles well and in some cases were a bit more unique flavor wise (which is always fun). Loved the bar/building as well. Everything was super clean (always a perk). The bartender was great and took time to answer any questions we had. His dog (mila??) was also present and seemed ok with all the comings and goings of the patrons. She briefly played ball with me, but alas I was rejected when a new canine friend entered.... We also were lucky to meet some nice locals who gave us some other recommendations of places to hit while in town.

MommamurphyFlorida,Awesome view!,Unfortunately the day we visited the weather wasn't the greatest but even so the view was awesome.  It was a dreary day with light rain in the air.  It wasn't crowded at all as some people said but it was the middle of the week & it wasn't a great day weather-wise. We walked around the grounds & up to the lighthouse.  I really wish it was a clearer day but our time in the area was limited so we  couldn't go any other day.  The road up to the Point is a winding road past the National Cemetery and the Military base.  We spent quite a while walking the paths & just looking at the view.  There are restrooms & there is a gift shop of course.  Hopefully someday we will get back to San Diego so we can experience the beauty of the area during some better weather.,50,Point Loma,January 2018

Anthony D,A lovely place to relax.,"Perched high above the ocean surface, the park is a lovely place to relax and enjoy they sound of the beach. Access to the sand is available along the pathway at various locations, but some of the 'paths' are a little slippery.

LaBernardi,Take the tour,This iconic Louis Kahn deserves a visit by anyone who practices or loves great architecture or who conducts scientific research. It is beatified in my mind because you can feel the pull of architectural history and sense the dedication to emerging scientific breakthroughs just strolling among Kahn's masterpiece. View of the ocean magical any time of the day. Some may find it sterile but then your antennae have to be desensitized to the great in human accomplishments.

I find the tide pools in San Diego County are a relaxing way to spend the day as beachcombers get absorbed in their respective searches so these parts of the beach are far quieter than the swimming beaches.

""","My wife and I were invited to the 2016-2017 Broadway San Diego Preview Presentation and VIP Party a week ago at the Balboa Theatre in San Diego, and we had a great time !. My wife and I have been President Club  season ticket holders at Broadway San Diego for several years. Every year Broadway San Diego has a special invitation only Preview Presentation and  VIP party for President Club members. The purpose of the event  is to view the entire up coming and new play schedule for the next Broadway San Diego Season. The presentation was hosted by Barbara Lee Edwards from KFMB Channel 8 news. After watching a short preview of which plays that were going to be featured for 2016-2017 season, we  listened to live performances by singers from the Sound of Music, and the Lion King.  Lead singer Tshidi Manye  came all the way from New York City, just to sing the famous ""Circle of Life"" song to us. Tshidi's performance was breath taking ! After previewing  the  2016-2017 season, the VIP Presidents Club members were invited up on stage for a very special  party. The party included  wine, champagne bars,  and a magnificent collection of decadent finger foods, which were prepared by St. Tropez Bakery & Bistro. Everything was delicious ! Sarah Jordan the Senior President's Club Representative who my wife and I deal with the most, is Awesome ! Sarah is so professional and precise, as she has handled all of our wants, needs, and requests perfectly over the years. Sarah also played a large roll in the success of this event. Vanessa Davis, Sarah Jordan's boss, and who is Broadway San Diego's Groups, Patron Sales, & President's Club Manager, did a wonderful job organizing, and preparing everything for this Broadway Presentation and VIP Party. Broadway San Diego Vice President Joe Kobryner started the VIP Party off, by  introducing all important  sponsors and guests to the VIP Party members. Towards the end of the VIP Party, the director of Marketing and Business Development Carl Thompson, raffled off several very nice prizes for all guests in attendance. This night at the Balboa Theatre was Informative, Fun, Fantastic, and was nicely organized and executed by all Broadway San Diego employees. Great Job ! The Nederlander Group would be very proud of you !",50,Broadway San Diego,January 2016

The front room is the court room and now has displays and the bench area is roped off. The back has two smaller rooms for a clerk and sheriff. Behind is an iron box which was the jail - I wouldn't want to be locked up in it for long. Allow about 5 to 20 minutes. It's free and part of the Old Town San Diego Historic Park.

Because of that breadth, you may well find your sport hero here:  it surprised us to learn that some of our favorite Broncos came from San Diego!  The museum has a strong focus on Football (Chargers), Baseball (Padres, both minor and major leagues versions), and the America's Cup, with minor exhibits on Basketball (Rockets before they went to Huston, and Surfing.

Nancy B,Interesting Place,"This little museum is so packed with great items, from rare posters to rare coins and stamps, sculptures, masks, special books, charts, African cloths, and photographs, that it really deserves a beautiful building, Balboa Park-style, to house it all. You have to go in realizing you must take your time examining every precious inch. Don't expect beautifully spaced exhibits; there simply isn't enough room. The owner and founder of this museum is an inspirational, intelligent, and devoted guide. He makes everything come to life and puts it all in perspective. If you have an interest in proud African, Africa-American, and Latino history, this is one of the few places in San Diego to get an authentic glimpse. Be smart. Navigate it patiently and leave having learned quite a few interesting things. Definitely worth not only a visit but a community endorsement to house it in a building that has the capacity to showcase everything aesthetically. It is a powerful collection.",40,Casa del Rey Moro African Museum,June 2017

It was a relatively easy and a short round- trip hike (less than an hour). Pretty views! Lots of air traffic from North Island as well as boats and ships in the passage. Go early before it gets hot! ,40,Bayside Trail,June 2019
FernandoJMolina,AMAZING,"The hike itself is great, make sure to bring WATER (a lot of it), the bad part is that it's really a mission to get to the trail head, about a 40 minute drive from the main highway, but it's a pretty country drive, the last couple of miles are on a dirt road trail (yes, you will need a car wash after) and there is no cell reception make sure to have a full tank of gas.  Once at the trail head it's a pretty nice hike, it gets pretty warm so make sure you are hydrated and have sun block. It is a pretty intense hike, so think about it before bring young kids, (Hills, rocks and debris). Follow the dirt trail, once you hit a wooden pole, just follow the dirt path to the left. The waterfalls are about 2 miles from the parking lot. They are 2 tub basin area to lounge in if you wanna get wet (don't forget a suite and a towel).  I would recommend this hike, it was well worth it.",40,Three sisters waterfall Trail,April 2019
travelnownotlater2,"Moderate hike, challenging to get to",The hike itself was the right amount of difficult and took about 2.5 hours round trip. To get to the trailhead you really need a 4x4. The roads have large potholes sometimes causing your car to bottom out. The waterfalls at the end of the hike we’re pretty but not mind blowing and allowed for swimming at the bottom. Do bring plenty of water as there is little to no shade and lunch or a snack to eat on the rock when you arrive at the falls. ,40,Three sisters waterfall Trail,June 2019

From the outside, this place looks like a random office building, but once inside, you are transported to the deck of a ship that inspires you to enjoy the experience. In addition to rum, they also have a vodka, bourbon, and a whiskey, but the best surprise of my visit was tasting their Cabernet barrel aged rum. Delicious! ",50,Malahat Spirits,January 2018

The puppets and props seemed very low quality and poorly put together (and honestly Thumbelina looked scary to me). Our kiddo didn't complain, but my husband and I definitely wish we had spent our time elsewhere, especially since there are so many things to do in Balboa Park.

The staff was great in trying to accommodate us with bats and clubs. We went to the batting cage first. The machines suck. Out of 20 pitches, only about 5 were hittable. The rest were bouncing off the plate or way over our head. We felt cheated on our money. So, we went and traded our remaining batting time for clubs and golf balls. The staff gave us a little discount on the driving range because batting wasn't worth the value. We rented some clubs and went to go hit some golf balls. I'm pretty sure that the driver they let me rent was one of the original wooden head clubs from the 70's. It was pretty sweet to hit with.

You start a brewery!  Their beers are decent and evolving.  Their facility is warm and inviting.  They have the discipline to succeed!  Give them a try!,40,Protector Brewery,August 2017
4billk,Joined their club - glad we did.,"We'd barely heard of 2Planks Winery, but since it was local to North County San Diego, decided to give it a shot.  It's Excellent.... Both the wines and the employees.  Their wines are from various locations (Fallbrook, Rancho Santa Fe, Napa/Sonoma).  That diversity works in their favor.  I'd call it the excellent inconsistency.  Don't look for similarities wine to wine. Expect surprises. Each is very different. We have been there twice now. (We joined at the first visit.)  We took home six bottles each time.  Their Zinfandel is excellent. Their 2014 Zin is the best - very fruit forward, jammy, juicy, and bold. The 2013 Zin has a bite to it. Sharp, crisp, distinct.  This was a great find in a most unexpected location - the Vista Business Park area, off Sycamore Ave.  Very enjoyable.  See you soon.  Note: This is their second location - the Sorrento Valley location was their first... (haven't been there yet.)........",50,2Plank Vineyards,August 2016
tango982015,North County location in Vista is awesome!,"We are big red wine lovers with big tannins and jammy fruit. This is our only winery along Hwy 78 we joined.

MelissaandRick,Taking a ride along the Silver Strand,"We decided to take a bike ride along the silver strand bike path one sunny Saturday and had a wonderful time stopping along the way to see the shoreline.   We ended up making our way to Hotel del Coronado, parking our bikes and walking along the beach.   It was a fun day and the weather was perfect.   Having ice cream on the beach was an added bonus.  We ended up covering ten miles on our bicycles that day and seeing the island at our pace.   In more busier areas of town and on side walks you are directed to walk your bike.   Having areas to lock them up was convenient and helpful.   ",40,Silver Strand Bike Path,January 2017
eric w,"Protected, quiet cove with lifeguards","This is a nice, quiet spot to swim without the waves. There are lifeguards during some seasons. The water is calm. A lap from the southern beach to the opening of the cove is approximately 250 yards. Kids play along the sandy beaches, families barbecue in the grassy areas surrounding the lagoon.",50,Leisure Lagoon,September 2017
Guide803333,great combination between nature and art,"I haven't seen this place on a guidebook and I made up my mind to visit there, hearing the good reputation from the locals.

AlexanderD,Lovely Spot,"The fountain itself is beautiful, no doubt. But it is the location at the heart of Balboa Park which makes it so worth the visit.

Brit702,"Great, low key beach",Came to this beach with toddlers. The parking lot is very close to the beach for easy access to belongings and packing up. Beach was very family friendly and low key (no big groups of partiers or loud music). The current was too strong for swimming but kids had a nice time playing in the sand and collecting rocks. ,50,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,July 2019

CaptainD4,Extremely gay and in your face,"This theater company is loud and proud of the San Diego gay community.  They often perform original plays adapted from old standards, adding gay/lesbian elements that permeate the performance.  Often hilarious, often thought provoking, always getting thier message of equality and liberty to anyone who will listen.  Many of the shows are musicals.  Very talented performers. With their tiny stage and crowded seating plan, you are always close to the action.",40,Diversionary Theatre,February 2011
mgm1854,Great little theatre with some very good shows,"We have been season ticket holders for several years. We do find that some of shows are better than others, but that may just be because of what we like to see. The plays are mainly gay themed but they do not go overboard.

shhsed,Lot’s of hiking trails,"The only drawback to the reserve was the $15 parking fee. Driving to the top of the reserve is recommended, with several trailheads along the way. Each trail was short, but enjoyable. The walk along the beach was fun, as there were seashells galore (many still housing live animals).",40,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,June 2019

Bintbatoutta,interesting park worth the visit,"On a good day, visit this park. It is a must. Clean and good views. Parking can be a problem and costly but if you like to walk long distances, try parking far away on side streets closer to the lodge/golf club near the main street and keep walking until the trail takes you in the park. Can make a quick stop for restrooms up there (currently closed but there were few portable restrooms and not so clean but that is all you get). Then walk to the Information center lodge (no restrooms there) but at least there is a water fountain outside to refill. Then continue down the road all the way down to the beach where the main park kiosk is. Of course there are side trails for even better views. Warning, to go back, you will have to hike up the road again to get back to your car. Worth the effort.",40,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,June 2019

ktflow3,Nice hike but standard with a view,"Plenty of hiking trails to choose from.  If you like hiking and in good shape, nothing too hard, more average.  But if not in shape these could be challenging.  After we paid the $15 to get in, we found out others park 50 yards away and then walk up.   but it's a long walk uphill.   Small visitor center up top, then we hiked, then we left.  Nice views of the ocean from the trails though",40,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,June 2019

Lighteye7,Ticketing at Adobe Falls,This is private property that is posted and patrolled. The paint is toxic and is flaking off then flowing to the ocean. Very disrespectful people have left a lot of trash here also. In addition the neighbors will call the police when they see anyone near the property because crime rates have gone up with people coming to the falls.,10,Adobe Falls,February 2018
Mark D,Great Place for Families,This is a wonderful place to have a picnic or just hangout with the family. Grass park surrounds the cove with plenty of benches and restrooms. There is a lifeguard station there but they were not present when we visited. The kids enjoyed getting into the water and playing in the sand. It is easily accessible right off Hwy 5,50,Leisure Lagoon,February 2018
Eric M,"Great View, Nice Long Path","Started the path at the beginning of the Bayshore Bike Path by the Swiss, and went all the way to the  Del (Hotel Del Coronado).  As a bike path its great.  Skating the Bayshore portion is rough, the Silver Strand portion is very smooth and nice.  About 18.2 miles round trip.",40,Silver Strand Bike Path,June 2017
ltt244,exercise with a view,Never knew about this bike path....and if you're adventurous you can do the entire 24 miles around San Diego Bay (ferry needed) We did the path in three out and back rides. A bit challenging to follow on the eastern side through the industrial area south of the city. Will be wonderful when the entire loop is paved and signage is in place.,40,Silver Strand Bike Path,November 2017
Pj J,Bike Path,"Parking at the southern end was easy.  The ride started out in a coastal wildlife area.  Lots of birds and possible turtle crossings.  Really nice area.  Once on the strand, the trip was pretty monotonous.  Traffic was right next to you.  There were multiple road crossings where you needed to watch for cross traffic.  Closer to Coronado, the traffic increased.  You ride through town, next to a golf course.  Part of the trail is on the road.  Nice area.  Then you cross under the Coronado Bridge through an industrial area.  Once out on the other side, the scenery improved and you rode through parks to the ferry landing.  I turned around at Orange Ave. and retraced my path.  There was a pretty stiff headwind on the ride back and it was even more monotonous having just ridden it an hour or so earlier  The entire ride was pretty flat, so very easy.",30,Silver Strand Bike Path,August 2018
Michael A,"Good bike path in Coronado, but!","This bike path starts right after getting off the ferry and it’s very good along the water and marina and golf course, but after that it’s full of traffic and you can hear the cars whizzing by close to you.

We did walk every single trail and there is not one bad one. The visitor centre has tons of interesting information on the flora and fauna and history of this place. It took us several hours to walk all trails and take in the beauty. The trails all differ in views and length, some have stairs you need to climb and some have healthy inclines. Most trails are sandy so they may become slippery when wet. This is an amazing spot if you want to enjoy some nature. ",50,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,May 2019

I friend came to visit from Maine so we all went for the Private Event. It was great! Lynette was our Pourer and she was a delight. Barrett the Winemaker was a young and energetic and loved to share his knowledge of growing grapes and making the various wines. We started with their regular Tasting Wines, then moved into the Barrel Room  for tasting from 4 different barrels. There we meet Dom who is a jack of all trades at the Winery and learned a ton from him about the Wine making.

I would put their Reserve Zin up against any other winery, it is that good. Their Syrah rocks as well and the Cab Sauv and Cab Franc are dang good as well.

All of the dancers were incredibly poised, talented, powerful, flexible and the women exceptionally graceful.

Their is a fee at the gate entrance, unless you purchased, the senior park pass. The view of Coronado Island and the Naval base and air station there  is spectacular on a clear day. The visitors center runs a regular film on the discovery of San Diego by the Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and the history of Cabrillo and his crew and ships. The old lighthouse on the hill, 498 feet above the sea is also a must see. On the way to and from Point Loma you drive right  through the Rosecrans National Cemetery. On the way out we stopped for a short walk through the hollowed ground of the cemetery to reflect on the thousands of men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our great country.

You are able to get out on the rocks close enough to hear, see, smell, and feel the waves. It is beautiful. It is $30 to enter by car and $10 on foot or bike. I walked, which was good for me.

If you get caught during rush hour, you should plan to enjoy it for quite some time. Morning rush is toward the island and the navy base. The evening rush hour will catch you coming off the island.

PuslinchFrankie1,Fun Beach,Lovely to walk down the boardwalk watching the surfers.  It's not particularly wide so we were surprised that scooters and bikers are allowed and amused that the speed limit is max 8 mph.  So it's not very relaxing but it was an interesting beach to visit.,40,Pacific Beach,March 2019
Joshb2j,Quintessential California?,"I'm from Ohio, but if you were to ask me what the quintessential Cali beach would look like, I think PB must be it.  Big waves, blue water, and lots of tanned bodies walking and laying everywhere.  Surfers, skateboarding, scooters, and some hippies here and there round out the people watching.  I'm not sure why you wouldn't visit. ",40,Pacific Beach,March 2019
Maggie K,Nice beach with lots of bars and eateries in walking distance.,This was a nice stroll along the beach and walkway. Nice selection of eateries in the adjacent neighborhood. ,30,Pacific Beach,March 2019
Brian W,What a great place to truly vacation!,"I took my wife, two teenage daughters, and two of their friends on vacation. We stayed right on the boardwalk on Pacific beach in Mission Beach, California. Every morning we woke up to beautiful ocean waves, many times seeing dolphins playing and jumping in those waves.   The weather was beautiful all week. Plenty of fun stuff to do for the teens.  You can rent scooters to get up and down the boardwalk. This gives them the freedom to go shopping, go get ice cream, live out on the beach, or play games of volleyball. Even my wife and I got into enjoying the scooters.   Many great places to eat and enjoy the nightlife, and of course the best part watching the sunset over the ocean. Truly a beautiful sight to behold! I do suggest staying right on the beach. It is much more expensive but totally worth it! It is even fun just sitting and people watching is there are Plenty of amazing people you get to meet and see. Also just a short drive from La Jolla, where there was wonderful shopping, a place to get up and close with sea lions in their native habitat, and a wonderful beach of its own. We went parasailing, which was amazing, and even was able to buy a package to have a bonfire right on the beach next to the ocean as the sun set. What an amazing vacation!",50,Pacific Beach,March 2019

sunflowermary,A nice walk along the cliffs,"Continuing our walk along the La Jolla coast area, this park was lovely and quiet first thing in the morning but I am certain that it becomes quite busy during the day, especially during tourist season. Several artists had paintings and crafts for sale along the walkways. Others had tourist junk for sale - t-shirts and the like. It would be a prettier place without the sales pitches but it was a lovely park and a great view of some of the best southern California coastline.",40,Ellen Browning Scripps Park,April 2017
Bradley E,Welcome my Droogs,"No place in San Diego reminds me more of the futuristic distopian movie ""A Clockwork Orange"".

Donald S,Definitely Worth a Visit,"You must schedule a tour, but it is worth it. We stopped by and then went back. It was so interesting, perhaps since Louis Kahn has several building I know in Philadelphia. It was so perfectly situated and also well designed for scientists. So interesting to hear all this and see if. ",50,Salk Institute,November 2016
Gato77,An architectural masterpiece,"Be sure to schedule your tour in advance and leave time to park & check-in. Our docent, Barbara, was outstanding. She lives in the immediate neighborhood of the Institute and is very knowledgeable in both architecture and the Institute itself.

We also took advantage of the Louis Kahn exhibit through January 31 at the SD Museum of Art.",50,Salk Institute,January 2017
Capuppylover,Took my breath away.,"We watched this being built as we went down the freeway from Orange County.  It looked like something out of Arabian Nights and was unique to the area and one of a kind.  It's been so well kept that it still looks magical to me.

73-Charger-SE,Beautiful,"My wife and I had a couple of hours before we had to leave San Diego and we thought we would just go down to the beach and walk around for a short while. It was so relaxing to hear the birds, watch the small waves roll in, and just see the majesty of nature. We are so glad that we took the time, even though it was such a short time to just walk along the coast and enjoy mother nature. And the weather was such a difference from where we came from but had snow that it seemed like a little piece of heaven",50,Mission Beach,April 2019
Chance N,Sweet Fun for the Younger Crown,"This beach is well-groomed and attended.  People playing pass the whatever (football, frisbee, etc).  There are bars, dive eateries, and a small amusment park.  Good way to pass the entire day.  There is a boardwalk but it is actually mad of concrete and harrangued by scooters and bikes.",40,Mission Beach,April 2019

Escape-overseas,Making Education Fun,"Our daughter studied her many years ago so our visit to the campus was somewhat nostalgic. Well worth a visit if you are in the area to see the interesting architecture including the award winning library, featured as the spaceship in a sci-fi film. Don't miss the 'snake' pathway winding up the hill, or the quirky house balanced precariously on the edge of the multi- storey building. Strong wifi is free in the avenue leading to the library in the area of the multi food outlets and university on campus shops.",40,University of California San Diego,December 2016

Erik T,A few nice places...,"Like another reviewer said the area is still decent and you can find some nice shops and places and eateries, but the place also seems a little run down.  It's not like dirty or old, but not like super fancy or anything like you might think.  Good to kill some time and relax near the beach.",30,Girard Avenue and Prospect Street,September 2016

Erylis,Quiet in September!,"We were staying close by for a few days and enjoyed pottering around, shopping, having a drink and a few nice places for dinner.  I was surprised to see so many shops closed in the evening.  Perhaps September is just not busy enough for them to stay open after 6pm?!   Loved the gelato shop.  Whatever you do, leave room for ice cream! (dairy free options too)  Take a walk down to the seafront just beyond Brockton Villa to see the seals.  Great to watch if you can bear the smell!",30,Girard Avenue and Prospect Street,September 2016
Oldjack,Nice Street But Not Special,It is the main area for shopping and restaurants in La Jolla and is quite typical for a place on the ocean. The shops are OK as are the restaurants and cafe's but there is nothing really special. Definitely worth a visit as part of a visit to la Jolla and a walk along the ocean front. MTS Bus Number 30 from Downtown San Diego will drop you in a convenient location in La Jolla.,30,Girard Avenue and Prospect Street,October 2016
LPB1950,The dangerous Trail,"If you want to get rescued by a helicopter and pay for the trip-take this trail. It is dangerous and we have seen countless people hurt. It may be beautiful but one is so busy trying to navigate the corners and steep hills, you cannot appreciate the surroundings-the better option is at the gate where Blackgold Rd. meets La Jolla Farms- a large metal gate (just go around it) and the walk down to ocean is spectacular and easy.",50,Ho Chi Minh Trail,December 2014

Really cool rock formations and canyons though, totally worth needing to carry my bike back up to the top. ",50,Ho Chi Minh Trail,December 2014
intothevoid612,"Fun, but difficult hike","Wear good shoes that you don't mind getting dirty.  This trail left me muddy and a bit scraped up, so watch your step and take your time.

Our student guide was good but not so ebullient.  The buildings seem old and except for the futuristic-looking library, the architecture throughout the campus is nondescript.

hemangjshah,Serene campus and must visit Geisel,"UCSD has such a neat campus. I used to go there running every couple of weeks. Tourists must take a look at the Geisel library. If you have more time, go for a run/walk in the UCSD woods meant for cross-country runners.",50,University of California San Diego,September 2015
Jeffree I,Visit one of the world's best universities,"I am admittedly a little biased about UCSD because I worked there for 13+ years before retiring in the spring of 2013. It's a great institution and for those students lucky enough to get in -- a phenomenal place to get an education. As am employee I was proud of being part of such an amazing institution; I was also privy to many of the campus's inner workings, special exhibits and reasons why tourists should visit. From the quirky leaning house built on the corner of the Engineering building (it's like walking into a scene from Alice in Wonderland, complete with slanted floor) to the architecturally jaw-dropping library to Scripps Institute of Oceanography to the expansive campus full of native flora to the playhouse to, oh just go - too much to describe. Only caveat, parking is a hassle, you'll need to look for visitor lots and pay up ahead of time. It will be worth it. ",50,University of California San Diego,April 2016
Scott M,Ho Chi Min Trail,"I went alone and once I located the entrance between two fences and behind a bush it was great. Wear good traction shoes there are a few sketchy places, if you slipped off the trail and into the riven it would really hurt and you more then likely couldn't scale the sides back out. I saw no one else on the way down. I walked south to the Mushroom House and back up the steep road from the beach back to my car. Very few people out, mainly surfers. It's an awesome short hike to the beach!!!",50,Ho Chi Minh Trail,June 2015

Lori S,A Great Spot in La Jolla,"This was one of our favorite spots in La Jolla.  The kids loved looking for seashells and were able to wade through the water .  Of all of the spots in La Jolla, we spent the most time on this small beach.  The climb down over the rocks can be a bit treacherous if you are older or out of shape but it is well worth it.",50,Shell Beach Tide Pools,March 2016
Kauai-Biz-Traveler,A favorite activity -- 2 warnings,"There's so much to do in this area, it's one of our favorite destinations. The tide pools are great places to find shells or just get on a high point and enjoy the sounds and views. Warning 1. The cliffs do erode. Don't climb and be careful standing where it's clear big pieces fall routinely. Warning 2. Walking along the beach will quickly remove you from many easy options to get back to your car. Pay attention to your location and the easiest escape trails.",50,Shell Beach Tide Pools,March 2016
Mark Q,Great place for the kids to explore during low tide,Look at the tides before you go...get there 1-2 hours after high tide is over and stay there until low tide.  This is a great place for kids to explore the tide-pools.,50,Shell Beach Tide Pools,July 2015
atreyu-plainswalker,"Cool campus, interesting art.","If you are coming by, consider stopping by the Geisel library.  Best views are from the 6th floor.  The Fallen Star installation is only open to visitors between 11 and 2 on Tuesdays and Thursdays but worth a visit as well.

AimeeLally,Pretty campus but I wouldn't call it a tourist attraction,Beautiful campus with some interesting architecture.  We stopped here to take a quick look at the campus for my son.  He was most interested in the soccer program there.  The soccer stadium was very lacking but the athletic facilities seemed more up to date.  Some nice dorms and some run down ones.  Definitely a possibility though.  Beautiful La Jolla/Torrey Pines location!,40,University of California San Diego,June 2016
Tony H,Impressive campus with innovative architecture,"This sea side campus is expansive and has several different colleges, mostly focused on engineering and medical careers.  Some of the the architecture is pretty impressive including the Geisel Library named after Dr. Suess who was a patron and the house crashing into the top of one of the other buildings, meant to symbolize the students crashing from home life to campus life.  Worth a visit even if you arent a potential student ",40,University of California San Diego,June 2016

I spend four days in a row here walking along the Ocean down to Hospitality Point where I saw a blue heron and a beautiful wildlife area for birds. Some of the owners do not pick up their dogs poop, but most do. It is fun to see them play in the ocean and interact with other dogs.

Colin A,A True Gem for People Interested in Naval History,"Many people visiting San Diego have no interest in History, so this is not for them.  If you have an interest in Naval History this is a must see.  In NTC Park at Liberty Station there are two walkways that cross the park which are lined with plaques that tell the history of the Submarines that made a critical difference in the war in the Pacific.  Each plaque tell the story of a particular Submarine and gives the names of those who gave their lives in service the Submarine Service.  This is a must see for anyone who has interest in Naval History.",50,52 Boats Memorial,March 2019

Marilyn H,I love this little park!,"A great place to come and people-watch, exercise, or just play. There's a small grassy area where leashed-dogs are allowed, a few swings and volleyball net close by. It's on Mission Bay so a bike, walking path allow you to check out the people/area as you cruise by. It's fun to look at the high-rent homes/vacation rentals along the path. Catamaran Inn is about midway around the circle, where you can get a bite to eat, or get a massage, mani/pedi. I plan on going once a month.",50,Fanuel Beach Park,April 2017

Tonya C,Love the Peanut Butter Stout,"One of the things I really wanted to do for my first trip to San Diego was try out their craft beer that I heard so much about.  There are so many different breweries so it was really difficult to choose where to go.   I did some research and found that the Belching Beaver Brewery had a peanut butter stout.  I love stouts and I love peanut butter so I had to try this!  I did a flight which consisted of four beers.  In addition to the peanut butter stout, I also tried Here Comes Mango, Don’t Blink, and the Mexican Chocolate Peanut Butter Stout (yes, I tried two peanut butter stouts but the only thing I love more than peanut butter and stouts is chocolate peanut butter).  All were good but the peanut butter stout was my favorite!  I would definitely recommend this place for a beer!",40,Belching Beaver Brewery Ocean Beach,June 2018

CADreamers28,San Diego Symphony Bay Park,"We were there for the Roger Daltry concert. The sound system was excellent, but the actual seats, not so much. I understand that the chairs are arranged differently for the symphony,  but in their effort to cram as many seats as possible into the venue, they literally lash the skimpy plastic seats together so tightly it's difficult to get across the aisles. My husband and I are average size people and we were cramped. The thighs of the woman who sat down next to me literally spilled over on top of me. Since the guy sitting on the other side of my husband was also large, we were literally penned into our seats. Very uncomfortable. And since the lawn is flat, you can't see, either, so you watch the whole thing on the giant screens. Why bother going to a live event? I would suggest lawn or grandstand seats. The grandstand is elevated, and at least on the ground you can stake out your space.",30,Embarcadero Marina Park South,August 2018

GoinThere2,Nice Building; Not Much In It,"There's just not much left of the first European settlement in what's now the State of California but they've built a nice building to house it. The museum does it's best to explain the indigenous and early Spanish history, along with the accomplishments of Padre Serra who founded the first of the missions along the California coast. It just doesn't have a lot to work with. There are some period artifacts and some reconstructions but it seems that not a lot has been added to the collection since it opened in 1929. One of the original cannons from the Spanish Presidio (fort)  is on display, albeit damaged by vandals in the Nineteenth Century and patched. The Museum's tower floor is given over to the businessman who donated the building and surrounding park, thereby saving the site. There are some nice views from the tower as well. From the signage it seems the building is as much an events centre as it is a museum. It's also heavily used as a location for photo shoots, both commercial and bridal. If you can get a discounted entry fee I'd say it's worth it. The whole thing might take an hour at most. For serious history buffs I'd recommend the second San Diego de Alcala Mission site, built a couple of years after this one, which has its original building intact (still a church).",30,Junipero Serra Museum,December 2015

He started out about 70 years ago with ""Frank, the train man"" in San Diego and when Frank died many years ago he took over the whole thing and expanded it to include the ancient autos, etc.  We had a 90th birthday party for a friend there and it was great.

What sets this place apart is the beertenders -- these guys are beer lovers and they want other people to know and love beer, too. They really made the experience.

SterlingFoxInc,A Military Grade Viewpoint of San Diego,"Built between 1928-1929 on the grounds of the Royal Presidio of San Diego, the Junípero Serra Museum is a prime example of Spanish Revival architecture and one of the most cherished event halls in the city. Sadly no historic structures remain of the Presidio, an abandoned 18th Century fort, but the view on the valley is unparalleled. One can easily imagine the importance of such strategic location in the early stages of California’s creation.

The building is a 1929 replica of the assumed original. There is a cost to enter the building part of the museum, but it is small and doesn't offer much in actual history from Serra's time, but rather a good photo collection of the 1929 construction and time period.

Trails lead to beautiful views of the Pacific with waves splashing just below. We snagged a parking spot at the top but most people had to park at ocean level and hike up. I've done that-- when I was younger-- and I remember thinking it was quite a hike. There is a nice though small museum near the top parking area.

Michael W,Huge Bridge with Great Views,We were travelling on a Old Town Trolley Tour Bus and as we approached the bridge  we were staggered by how huge it was. As we crossed the bridge the views across San Diego Bay were incredible. You can see the huge cargo ships loading & unloading at the dock-sides and warships and aircraft carriers around the bay.

Having just had an MRI done on my knee we stopped in at the visitor center to see if the San Diego zoo has electronic wheel transportation while at the zoo. I had heard that there was a lot of walking. Samantha went above and beyond and called the zoo to confirm that there were electronic wheelchairs, however they could not guarantee that by the time we got up there they would be any available. Therefore we decided not to go.

I loved the layout and the ""feel"" of the campus way back then and I was happy to see that it hasn't lost any of its charm, in fact it has continued to improve. The breadth of individual colleges within the university is really impressive and its dedication to higher learning is so clear.

Not many new the answers but it was still a fun way to pass the time and break the ice. The tour began with a video and then an admissions counselor spoke for a few minutes before dividing us into smaller groups led by individual UCSD students.  Our guide was very knowledgeable and outgoing. He was very considerate of everyone in our group and gave a great tour.

LIKEITIS1000,Unlawful parking citations,"We went there for a campus tour.  Everyone must park at the parking structure.  There are no parking anywhere. We paid for 3 hours parking ($8) to give us enough time to get back to our car after the tour.  We didn't have time to grab a bite to eat on campus after the tour ended because we had to run back to our car before the 3 hours are up.  We are conscientious about thing like that.  The varieties of foods there on campus looks so good but didn't have the time to sit down and try them.  We got back to our car on time and found a citation for $65 for no parking permit.  It was issued half an hour before our permit expired.  We put our permit in clear view in front of the window shield.  We couldn't find anyone to ask why.  We didn't know what we did wrong.  It's our first time visiting the campus and in San Diego.  Our first impression of San Diego is that it's very strict.  We've visited other universities in CA, and UCSD is the only one that give us problems. We wasted so much time looking for someone to talk to about the citation.  We found someone outside and pointed us to the the parking office, but the line was so long, filled with students applying for permit.  There was a repeal box filled with papers, so we added our to the pile.  It got us all worked up and upset because we are law abiding people.  It was just a waste  of our time trying to track someone down.   We parked in a visitor parking.  There wasn't any sign that say we can't park there.  Our whole time there in San Diego, all we could think of is the citation.  UCSD needs to retrain its people who issues all those unlawful citations to visitors.  Because of this incident, we'll be thinking twice about sending our child there.",40,University of California San Diego,July 2017

On the more difficult sections, if you were to fall, you would probably not DIE but you would get injured.  We were a little nervous but that added to the fun.  We hiked down near sunset, and the view was spectacular.  Part of the adventure is finding the trail head, and it's really fun to see the amazing houses in the La jolla farms area.  Once you hit the beach, you can either hike back out the same way, walk to the north, where there is a nude beach and another trail, or walk to the south and walk out on a road maintained by UC San Diego.

I recommend a full day for these; Birch Aquarium/ La Jolla, Old Town, Balboa Park, and the San Diego Zoo.

It's a lot smaller than I expected, but still interesting to look at from either a paranormal or historical perspective. From the center of Old Town it's maybe 10 minutes' walk, but once you get there you have plaques explaining the historical significance, as well as the disturbing information that there were graves under San Diego Avenue that were never moved. Instead, they have markers on the sidewalks. Most of the graves in there are of ancient settlers to Old Town, or relatives. No one really famous, unless you count Yankee Jim (the ghost of Whaley House). Worth stopping by to see if you're in the area.",40,El Campo Santo Cemetery,July 2015

Very nice modern clean tap room.  MAD went to the dark side with one of the dark selections, maybe a Stout with some Vanilla and Fig undertones, and I went to the Dank side with an all German IPA.  Both were amazing.  Service was great.  There was an awesome Burgermaster outside if you wanted to nosh.

Cool to just hang out and enjoy the San Diego climate and a smooth craft beer.  Frequent often....,50,Fall Brewing Company,January 2016
deamole,Not the best of San Diego's tasting rooms.,Visited here mid evening on a week night. The place was pretty dead. There was a food vendor just outside the front door making kabobs but I did not try the food. The tasting room itself was pretty unimpressive and bland. The beer was decent but having just visited Rip Current down the street it did not come close to comparing. Overall it was worth the stop for a quick sample but did not rate at the top of my list.,30,Fall Brewing Company,March 2016
Owen D,Go before everyone finds out about this place,Hopefully I haven't written this to late for the reader to get to this place before it's jam packed!!  When i went in September it was a long walk in the dark down to an industrial estate where no other business is even open at night so it was a little daunting! So worth it though as the beer selection was amazing.  Some of the freshest stout's and IPA's I've ever tasted.  I am a massive Mikkeller fan though so maybe a bit biased!,40,Mikkeller Brewing San Diego,September 2016

sharrongeg,Interesting little place,"I understand that this place is a bit of a joint venture between Mikkeller (a Danish brewing company) and AleSmith.  We have had Mikkeller beers at various brewpub/taprooms in Las Vegas and enjoyed them - so decided to visit.   Hip industrial setting with cool painted walls and a bean-bag toss set up in back.  Tucked away in the corner of an industrial park - it was pretty easy to find.

A complimentary breakfast buffet was included.  The parking is $16 per night but if you have Handicap parking it is free.  The only complaint I have is the traffic noise with the city view rooms.

krishj39,Beautiful Theater with painfully tiny seats,"My wife and I attended a show here last night. We sat on the Mezzanine floor and the theater is small enough I think the best view is from here, really all the seats here offer a good view. The problem is that I literally didn't fit in the seats. My knees hit the seat in front of me such that it was impossible to have my feet on the ground if my legs were pointed forward as normal when sitting in a theater. I am 5 foot 10. The way the seats are designed, my knees hit the hard thin lip of the top of the chair and it was too painful to tolerate. A few minutes into the show I had to get out of my seat and find another spot. Having a seat so small I couldn't sit there was a first for me. I moved back to a mostly empty row and sat where I could spread my knees open comically far to fit in the seat. My wife joined me up there after the intermission. I checked out the ground floor during intermission and the seats there are a more normal distance apart, about 6 inches more than the mezzanine. So if you are taller that 5'5"" I'd recommend you sit down there. But be aware that basically all the seats here will have you looking up at the performance. The other thing worth mentioning is that the parking is valet only. This is fine when you arrive but I suggest you book it down after the performance to get in front of the hundreds of others needing the same valet service from those same 3 employees.",30,Spreckels Theater,June 2015

Jay W,Ragtime: The Musical.....A Hit!,"Ragtime is one of great books by E.L. Doctorow.  San Diego Musical Theatre did a superb job, and many times the work was better than the original, mostly due to the tight and loving direction.  Excellent casting (almost all 100 percent), a two level set which allowed for perfect sight lines and distinctive movement.  Loved the work of the actors and singers (the father was a bit less exciting to watch).  The lady who played the mother, Carolyn Agan, was so good it made me forget the original Broadway performance.  Excellent musical direction with a huge orchestra. What a treat!!  Only carping point was the set for the families house:  did not indicate the status of the family and it shook when the door was closed.  Atlantic City sequence was awesome.  I love a good, passionate musical with a brilliant (totally brilliant) score.  We led the standing ovation on the first night.  Well deserved.  A gem of a company.",40,Spreckels Theater,February 2016

It truly is a treasure in San Diego, is close to downtown, and easy to get to. Those of us who live in San Diego place this high on our own list of places to spend an afternoon.

Fleet is a great place for kids to visit and the science exhibits are hands on and will keep the little ones busy.  One museum that is always overlooked because it is somewhat hidden is the Toy Railroad Museum,  it has  the most amazing replicas of San Diego and the most enormous toy railroads you will probably see.

Excellent service. Attentive but not overbearing. The food is excellent! We had a couple of starters then entrees. The selection is just right- not overwhelming yet something for everyone! The portions are just right as well. Not too large and overwhelming. Quality and fresh ingredients. Something you would expect in a high end restaurant, not a distillery with a bar! I wanted to buy a couple beverages from the retail store. Due to ABC regulations we had to take a tour first. We were promised it would take 5 minutes, or we could opt for a simple PowerPoint or even go,back to the bar and do it online. We took the live tour and were not disappointed!

GoinThere2,Authentic old San Diego,"After decades of neglect, old San Diego's early cemetery (or what was left of it) was preserved and later restored by volunteers and then archeologists. Ground penetrating radar was used to locate 93 graves. Church records and the few remaining headstones were used to identify as many as possible. The stories associated with the graves tell of prominent citizens, criminals (like Yankee Jim) and the innocents-children who died too early. Further along San Diego avenue are the other preserved remnants of Old Town, like Whaley House and the State Historic Park. Somehow, they're not as evocative of the past as this small, walled, easily missed cemetery. Some of the graves are adorned by fresh flowers or toys, presumably by families still in the area. A must for history buffs, but also of general interest. A close inspection of the graves will take about 15 minutes.",50,El Campo Santo Cemetery,December 2015

There is a nice selection of vendors of both food and merchandise.  I found a great CBD vendor that I purchased a salve and a tincture from - both work wonderfully.

It has local produce, entertainment throughout the market, a variety of food vendors and a section for selling items like clothing, jewelry, etc.  I love the vibe in Ocean Beach.

griefilm,It's all about the beer!!,"I have been a fan of Mikkeller beers for quite some time now, so I was not going to let the chance go by to sample a bunch of them while in San Diego. It's a bit out of the way and a non descript locale but to me, that just lends to the charm and the ""in the know"" cult status of Mikkeller. They are currently renovating this spot, so the decor is somewhat industrial and utilitarian but in the end, it's all about the beer. Of course, a bit pricey for suds but you pay for quality and creativity and if you are a beer geek like me, it's worth it. Now they have an adjoining bottle shop with both San Diego and Danish beers for sale, along with some swag. Would've been great if a food truck was there during my visit, but alas, I'll hopefully experience that the next time I'm there.",50,Mikkeller Brewing San Diego,October 2019

I got a flight which ran me $16, which is the most I’ve ever paid for a flight, more than Great Notion in Portland which I would argue is far better on the hazy’s. Maybe I got their beers wrong, but they described  most of them as murky, so by this I take it to believe they’re not proper hazy’s.

Whilst planning our stay, and having noticed road signs for the 'scenic route' before the internet provided full details of the route and vantage points along the way. With a visit planned for the week it gave the ideal opportunity to make the most of the route, enabling us to stop off and enjoy the sights, some we had experienced before, others equally new to us. If you have a few days to spare I can recommend the route and with so much to experience, just like us, you will want to return time and again.

That is why I may try it again. The food however was less than exciting. I wish they had a few more unique options but I tried their fried chicken sandwich. I would not recommend it unless you want a very dry thin cut piece of chicken. The condiments and bread used on this sandwich were the only good tasting parts. The could have made it with a thicker and moister piece of chicken and it would have been great. Their is no waitress/waiter service.

More recently there has been a growth of Asian dessert cafes such as boba cafes and Korean shaved ice.  (Also one of the last remaining Wienerschnitzel is found at the corner of Convoy and Armour St) Weekends starting Friday evenings to Sunday evenings are the busiest times as local San Diego residents and visitors alike descend upon this neighborhood to enjoy the ethnic cuisines served here and to hang out.

823JamesA,Lovely walk thought there would be more,We took an Uber from Pacific beach about $25 and he dropped us at the bottom of the hill at the start of the trails. To start the trails and get to the visitor centre you walk up the hill you can’t miss it and arrive past a couple of look out points the visitors centre. The look out points have great views at the VC they like to hear their own voices. The trails are simple and short not very difficult. We took the beach trial and went via a couple of the smaller paths. All is well sign posted. At the beach we went souls and walked towards La Jolla shore which took about 2.5 hours or so and we stopped for a swim. To do this walk on the beach tied needs to be going out by around 2 hours. We had a great day but thought the trails would be longer and harder. ,40,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,September 2019
U2871JYrobertm,Good Nature Experience,Our family enjoyed panoramic views of the cliffs and ocean.  We especially enjoyed the small museum/store with books and exhibits as well as souvenirs. We will be coming back to hike and enjoy more of the trails and beach.  It was relaxing and fun to enjoy nature.  We will have to take more time to experience it all.,40,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,August 2019
Safari782319,Scenic hike,"I have been hiking here for years. The views are incredible. CA State Parks does their best to keep the trails maintained. I would say it is fine for beginners, especially if you are hiking downhill to the beach. A note about that...check daily to see when high tide is. Avoid going then if you plan to hike up from or down to the beach unless you want to get wet. There will be very little beach to walk on and you will be forced against the bluffs. You should try to walk at least 20 ft away as the bluffs can collapse, although rare. Time of year matters with more sandy beach below in the summer and more straight rocks in the winter months. There is a charge for parking in the lot but there is some beachfront parking for free if you’re lucky enough to snag a spot. You will also want to check the hours as they are seasonal.",40,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,September 2019

Helen K,A litte known treasure,"This one of those ""attractions"" you just bump into, located on the plaza in Old Town. I have long loved this little known treasure for the grace and beauty of the building and grounds. They've been doing some upgrades with interior renovations which I think will attract more people. But for me, I'll visit this place simply for the courtyard, complete with adobe oven and charming gardens. I even have a photo on my living room wall of that oven, which I bought from a local photographer at the Old Town art festival a few years ago.

Then in July to see ""Walking the Shadows of August"". And this month for the annual ""Spirit of 45"" celebration. The men and women at the museum receive every At A Boy we can give them for their dioramas, events and generosity to the public. But even more so to all of our Veterans.

trickykid1,The Sunday Gem in Balboa Park's Crown,"Here's the thing- these little houses are only open on Sundays from around noon-4 pm, and on a few other special occasions throughout the year, so you have to know to plan your Balboa park trip for Sunday afternoon. At around 2 pm one of the countries is also featured each week and they sing and dance for about an hour on the lawn. The host country also has more food on offer than just a snack. Once I was there when the US was the host and they had burgers and hot dogs going, and last weekend Turkey was the host and they were grilling kebabs. For that type of food I think prices are set, but they are still very cheap. Have some food and snacks here, chill on the lawn, watch the dancing, shop in the nearby Hall of Nations shop which has handicrafts from all the different countries on offer, then catch part of the Sunday at 2pm free outdoor organ concert at Spreckles Pavilion which is only about a block away. It's a great way to spend a Sunday. So relaxing and a throwback to the 1900s. :)",40,House of Pacific Relations International Cottages,October 2011

nanawatson,VMMC A Must See,"The Veterans Museum and Memorial Center is a must see for Veterans and for young children and adults. The building itself is beautiful and the artifacts are very interesting. One wall is dedicated to the Pearl Harbor Attack on December 7, 1941 and many of the survivors have signed the buoys painted on the wall. Richard DeRosset has painted many Factions of the war on the walls. At present, they have a Korean war display that is very interesting and they have a Women's room dedicated to women in military service. If you are intersted in the military, this is a must see.  It's very good for young people who don't know about our history.",50,Veterans Museum & Memorial Center,May 2013
BobOrleck,The Veterans Museum is a special place.,"Sheldon Margolis introduced me to this museum in Balboa Park.  It is a special place in a beautiful setting with history that you don't see elsewhere.  It reflects the personal feelings of those who shared their history.  The murals are unbelievable and the stained glass windows are beautiful and unique.  Some of they are religious but most are military.  I love the place and I will come back again and again.  Will and Rod and the others who volunteer their time make you feel like a special visitor.  Sheldon is quite the ambassador for the museum and after the visit I now share his enthusiasm.  If you have a group and want to do a special service that will be remembered, I would strongly suggest that you get in touch with them.  It is not only a great place but doing an event there is inexpensive.  ",50,Veterans Museum & Memorial Center,March 2014
David S,Well worth a visit,"We visited just before Memorial Day celebrations and were surprised just how quiet the museum and memorial was. Only $5 entry fee and some great displays on Korean War, Vietnam, Pearl Harbor and the role San Diego and in particular Balbo a Park played in WW1 and WW2. The museum's director was very helpful.

Colleen P,A new store,"While visiting The Headquarters for dinner at Seasons 52, my husband and I discovered a new store. It's called United Streets of Art San Diego and it has some of the most interesting articles for sale. The ""art"" is done on leather wallets, purses, bags, cell phone covers, etc. and they are colorful, sort of retro stuff. For those who like made in America and especially made in California, this is the place for you. The decor is unique-they have an old jeep and its trailer (military) as displays for the items for sale. Prices were about what it costs for leather goods and they are durable. This is a new outlet for them so not all items may be there. Check it out.",50,The Headquarters at Seaport,August 2016

I am so happy to see it restored to what it is now, It had gotten pretty run down while it was not in use. It is funny to walk around the courtyard (the patio as we called it) people sitting and eating where we used to process prisoners. I was pointing out all the different rooms we used back then and what they were used for....much different now. I wondered how many people sitting there eating wondered what had happened at this location back then......great job bringing it back!       We had our Christmas party at the Hyatt Grand this year. From our room we overlooked this place.

Also love taking visitors into Venissimo cheese shop--such a selection and Madison San Diego has a great selection for the ladies.  IF you are hungry- we have had great meals at both Seasons 52 and Puesto.  On Sundays they also have a farmers market around the perimeter which adds to the fun.

Great venue.  No bad seats.  Spunky cast.  Don't remember the name of the actor (sorry) but the tall guy is going places, great comedic timing.  A few distractions ... I think it would play better with actors who were actually alive in the 80's, and the clothes were caricature.  Also -- spoiler alert -- the Challenger reference was a big fat dud.",40,Horton Grand Theatre,February 2013

indysan,"Good food, Great Service, ... got to like Beer though","So if you don't like beer, be forewarned. But if you like ales, IPAs especially, this is a great place. Food is moderate-priced and good, good vegetarian options too. The beers are good, but not cheap.  Also being Downtown there is no on-site parking, but there are parking lots nearby - an ACE and ABM just across the street from the brewery which were reasonably priced on a weekday evening.",40,Karl Strauss',April 2015
Louise M,Great brew choices!,"We stopped by this Karl Strauss (our second location on this trip) for a quick happy hour drink.  I am always happy to see a cider offering as I am not much of a beer drinker.  My husband tried an I.P.A.

Jhn,"Good beer, awesome location!","The staff were knowledgeable and friendly, the beer was good and the location was great!

It’s in a great spot with awesome views of the marina - we were treated to a sea lion show right in front of us!  Lots of chill dogs and happy beer drinkers hanging out inside and out this lovely establishment.  This is the kind of place you wish was down the street from you at home.  So if you live in Point Loma you should get yourself down there now!,50,Eppig Brewing,May 2019
BARBARA C,An historic adobe hacienda,"When I was a little girl we referred to this attraction in San Diego's Old Town as ""Ramona's Marriage Place,"" referring to the story in the Helen Hunt Jackson novel ""Ramona."" Later, the museum was called by its authentic name, ""The Estudillo House."" Built in a square around an interior courtyard, it houses some interesting relics of old Spanish California. It's always held a romantic appeal to me.  Don't miss it if you visit Old Town San Diego State Historic Park.",50,Casa de Estudillo,May 2014
Wayne G,San Diego Heritage Hacienda in Old Town,"Waling through the door you see multiple rooms among the outer walls that were used for living and sleeping, a long porch/patio connecting the rooms in a ""U"" shape.  The remainder of the enclosed space is a wild garden of local plants, not terribly well groomed but full of interesting local examples.   There is an exit in the far corner where a gate allowed carriages and horses to enter.  The rooms are furnished from the period.  It's a step back in time, easily missed if you don't seek it out.",50,Casa de Estudillo,March 2015
Shanna T,An Early Piece of San Diego Spanish Colonial History,"See how the less wealthy lived by also visiting the Casa de Machado y Silvas (a two room abode house), located behind the Mason Street schoolhouse.  It is a marked contrast between the classes.

Joes686,Quiet Corner of Old Town,"The last time I was here, there was construction going on and refurbishing, but it still is a great ""hidden"" section of Old Town.

While you're waiting to be seated or even after your meal, both Grandparents and kids will enjoy a visit to the original jail and prison cells, a bit of oddball San Diego history!  You can enjoy the old photo gallery while creating some photo opp's of your own!  Kids will also enjoy shopping at Geppetto's toy store while the ladies can browse at my two fave boutiques Coco Rose and Lolo's.

HappyTraveler0109,"Great For Kids and Adults!...And, FREE!","I like free fun...don't you? Doesn't everyone? It is amazing to me how fast SD has reinvented itself...to think that less than 30 years ago, what is now an array of wonderful shops and restaurants (including Cheesecake Factory and Starbucks) was the headquarters for a major police department and offices for The City Attorney and other court related services. This free attraction includes two open cells where kids can see what life was like for suspects, a suspects' backdrop where you can stand and get your ""mug"" shot (and learn your true height) and interesting vintage photos of police work from early in the 20th century until the close of the HQ in the 80's. This gem can take a couple minutes to a half hour to view depending on how fast or how much time you want to spend. It's a lot of fun. You should try it!",40,The Headquarters at Seaport,December 2017

Easy to get to and find.  The lobby is nice, and for our show, they had snacks and a bar.  The house is a great size, it's intimate and comfortable.  The stage is a decent size.  I would love to see different kinds of shows here, although it was a great home for Tonight In San Diego, a taping of the local ""tonight show"" comedy.",40,Horton Grand Theatre,October 2015

At 2:00pm to 3:00pm we enjoyed a wonderful concert put on by the House of Italy at 2294 Pan American Plaza, San Diego, CA 92101. The concert featured Music, Gelato, and Fun from the Jim Bianchi Italian American Ensemble. The Band featured Napolitan Tenor Rosario Monetti who was Awesome as he brought chills to your spine as he used his great Tenor voice to sing some classic songs. Soprano Kosondra Kazanjian was also very good as she sang some high notes for some  great Italian songs. Carlos Velasco on Guitar played very fast and well. Jim Bianchi on Keyboard and Dan Ochipinti on Drums were also very good. We enjoyed our picnic lunch under some shade trees, and thoroughly enjoyed the concert and the world cottages.

They give you a map to be able to find where you need to go. It is so beautiful there and peaceful. We did not realize how many graves were there and the walls with the cremated remains.

10ringtraveler,Nice walk,The best place to find a parking spot on the island is in this park. It is a nice quiet and clean park. It is pretty small but the walkways that go through the park extend from one end to the other on harbor Island. I think if you walk one end to the other and back it is about three miles.

She said, ""Well, there wasn't a super market back then, so they had to grow their own food"" I am very interested in history and I know that the settlers back then had to plant and have animals to eat.

Every play we've seen there has been top notch and totally enjoyable.

Frank N,Super overrated,"No customer service.  My wife and I ordered margaritas but our waiter wanted to take our dinner orders at the same time.  He was not happy when we said we were not ready.  My margarita was brought over after 10 minutes but not my wife’s.  It will come soon but you should order you food, he said.  After asking several times about the other margarita and getting the same answer, I finally ordered a ceviche for appetizer thinking that would expedite her margarita.  Our ceviche came and still no margarita.  Finally after we had finished our appetizer which by the way was nothing to write home about, the margarita arrived.  And by the way without any exaggeration, there could not have been any more than 1.5 ounces of liquid in each glass.   I should say that the margaritas  cost $14 each.  I finally gave up, asked for the check and left without ordering dinner.  It was obvious the waiter just wanted to turn the table over.  We ended up going elsewhere to eat dinner.  It is just ordinary Mexican food but very expensive and with absolutely no service.  DO NOT waste your time and money.  Not worth it.",20,The Headquarters at Seaport,February 2019

The play ""Bad Jews"" was presenting....as wonderfully acted as anything I have seen on Broadway or in the West End. An hour and a half of pure acting, marvellous acting, bringing the story of three young Jewish cousins, plus one girlfriend, to life as they coveted and argued over their late grandfathers estate, or rather, one piece of it!! (Don't want to give away too much detail!) The acting was superb, the writing moving and at the same time hilarious in parts...the theatre obviously custom built, was comfortable, intimate and the seating properly tiered. If you have a spare evening, treat yourself...Oh and the fact that pre-theatre drinks can be enjoyed in ""the front garden"" is just another charming  element of this quaint but totally professional little playhouse.

A talented cast, surrounded with professional scenery, staging and choreography, provided a wonderful ""Off Broadway"" experience. The theater is very small, an intimate performance venue. We enjoyed both the performance and the venue. One tip, if you're planning on eating in Old Town before the performance, it can get very busy so get there early!",50,Cygnet Theatre Company,March 2017

eileentx36,A lovely little theater with great plays,The nice thing about it was you can never be more than 11 rows from the stage.  We grabbed a burger at The Horton Grand Hotel next door.  Entrance is around the corner.  The burger was good and there was a piano player.  We sat near the bar by the fireplace.  If we go back to the theater we would eat there again as it is very convenient.  IndoorParking  across the street is $20.00 but you can pay less if you book online before you go.  ,40,Horton Grand Theatre,March 2019

jennifersR4870FJ,Delicious,Last stop in San Diego and it was worth it. Bartender was helpful and friendly. Tap room is laid back and the music is loud but not offensively so. You can tell there are regulars who come in on their Friday afternoons to read or hang out. The Pupil was as delicious and smooth as expected. The Pugilist was strong and smooth. The Pupil in the crowler held up well when we had it two days later at home.,50,Societe Brewing Company,June 2019

We were sitting on the side, and the only way to get out of the theater was to go down the steps to the stage and exit, or to go up the stairs and try to get past a row of people. In other words, you don't want to need the restroom during the performance, and we didn't have an intermission.",40,Cygnet Theatre Company,May 2014
PelleasPhiladelphia,Great Theater Experience,"I went to see Cygnet while visiting SD.  They produce a diverse season of plays and musicals - old and new in a really nice intimate theater (about 250 seats) that gives every seat a great view of the actors.  It is in a really fun part of town so it makes a perfect dinner and theater night.  ""Mother F-er with a Hat""  was a great dynamic show, very funny and edgy in way that the whole audience enjoyed.

Miss Texas was terrific, but Miss Bible Belt stole the night during her talent performance when she spoke in tongues. My sides and cheeks hurt form laughing so much.  Keep in mind that it is satire at its best.  Saturday Night Live in the theater.  Terrifically irreverent and that is a good thing!  I'm sure any other play here would be great too.",50,Cygnet Theatre Company,August 2014

CaptainD4,Fun and music and laughs,"I've been to several shows at this quaint little theater located in Old Town San Diego.  Every performance has been better than the previous one.  Very professional, extremely entertaining, always worth the ticket price.  But the secret is you can get half price tickets by calling and saying you are returning to see the show again.  You can also get half price by booking through GoldStar.  Their repertoire includes comedies, musicals, and heavy dramas.  The theater is only 9 rows deep, with a very steep rise between rows, so even if a very tall person wearing a hat were sitting in front of you, your view would not be obstructed.   The seating is arranged in a semi-circle around the stage, and there are no bad seats in the house.  The lobby is small and crowded, but there is plenty of space outside on the patio for intermission.",50,Cygnet Theatre Company,August 2011

We saw A Christmas Carol (performed as a 1940's radio program) and were blown away by the performances of all of the actors. During intermission we found the snacks, coffee, beer and wine to be very reasonably priced.

We found free street parking near the park and decided to check it out and I’m so glad we did. The views are amazing. La Jolla is the spot to go to see caves, seals, and amazing cliffs. There is a path that takes you along the edge and you climb down onto a large rock from the path which is where the seals are. The seals stink really bad so you’ve been warned. Also the rock you have to climb down onto to get close to them is not completely even so be careful with kids or if you’re wearing sandals. Going out onto the rock is totally allowed. While we were there a tour guide was taking his group onto the rock to see the seals. The park did have bathrooms and a large flat lawn for picnics. I did read a sign that said dogs were not allowed.",50,Ellen Browning Scripps Park,March 2018

Russ855,For Louis Kahn Devotees,"Yes, You have to be interested in this famous architect and brutalist architecture. But for those architectural fans, this is one of the most famous and most successful brutalist structures in the world. Combine that with the foundation's budget to maintain the building, and you have architectural nirvanah. It has just been restored in July 2017 with all new teak exterior. The one hour tours have to be reserved, but there are typically only five people and they are led by architects. The tour will get you inside and allow you to see more than the plaza. Would be great at sunset, but alas the tours are at noon. If you go 30 minutes early, there will be one of the post doc scientists come out and give a little talk about what they do. This gives a nice feel for what the Salk is all about. If you are particularly adventurous you can go down the road and go hang gliding from the Gliderport above Blacks Beach. The Geisel Library at UCSD is across the street if you want to round out your day of brutalist architecture.",50,Salk Institute,October 2017

I do not recommend this beach.",20,Mission Beach,June 2019
Sandy817,Get Control of the Scooters!,I hope Mission Beach gets a handle on the motorized scooters and other vehicles they are allowing on the boardwalk for all ages.  It is dangerous for those of us walking or just crossing to get to the beach!  And we saw kids with lacerations and bandages on their face.  One in a cast.  We saw one biker actually run into a pedestrian who fortunately was not hurt.  It's really dangerous there now.  And there are scooters discarded/abandoned all over everywhere in alleyways and at street corners so they are a hazard that way too.

The Museum was the highlight it was neat to see, we ate at one of the restaurants that was just ok. The candle shop was a treat, we watched them make a jack o lantern candle and bought it right afterwards. The live entertainment was a nice touch early in the evening.

Katie M,Interesting,"We both loved the Maritime museum. I wouldn't call myself a fan of boats but I found it really interesting. Our favourite parts of the museum was the Star of India boat. It was incredibly old and the history was fascinating. We also found the Russian submarine really interesting. Worth noting, that if you have back or leg problems, the submarine may not be for you as there are small tunnel doorways to get through. Really recommend this museum. They also put a stamp on your hand so you can re-enter during the day as you please.",50,Maritime Museum of San Diego,March 2019
Maisy12345,Interesting,"I have to admit this would not be my first choice of museum, but since I drag the other half round zoos etc it's a compromise we come to, but I was actually pretty impressed, the Russian sub looks like it could sink any minute but it's really interesting inside, that was my favourite bit although a bit of clambering through hatches to be done so need to be able to manage that, there is an interesting museum if you're not up for clambering and another submarine that was far easier, the old ships are worth a look and kids would enjoy pretending to be pirates etc, my fella would have stayed for hours reading every single sign, needless to say that didn't happen but we still filled a couple of hours, it's easy to get to and has parking next to it that looked popular",40,Maritime Museum of San Diego,April 2019
Gulliverelviajero,Pretty cool,"Lots to see, get a little much after a while. The HMS Surprise was awesome, the b29 Russian sub was cool too. The old steamboat is the actual museum itself.

Josh F,Deep dive into details,"You could cruise through the sailing ships, steamboat and submarine in this museum for a truly pleasant overview of how ships have shaped and interacted with San Diego as an core aspect of our history.  But if you have the time, this museum offers a depth of detail and some remarkable people who can give you those kinds of experiences where you learn so much about the universal through deep study of the particular.  You have here a chance to feel ( and luckily not smell) what life was like aboard a sailing ship, from hard tack to cannon fire to medical care such as it was. In the sub you can appreciate the apocalyptic dangers we faced in the Cold War with resonant implications for our current efforts to reign in roague despots with nuclear ambitions.  One senior docent in the bowels of the steamship helped us to understand appreciate and marvel at the mechanisms and working life of those massive and precisely machined engines. The docent at the swift boat exhibit was there in Vietnam and able to put us in those jungle rivers, hot, murky and dangerous situations where we tried to do right. So, you could stroll through, visit the gift shop, fet a couple of souvenirs, and have a lovely time. Do it. But if you have the time and the desire to know our world better through specific slices of history, take a day and spend the tome and you will truly benefit from your visit.  Oh, and cost of admission is peanuts compared to most museums.",50,Maritime Museum of San Diego,February 2019
BeeS24,Great for views not for workout,Love this trail for the view of the water and sandstones. This hike is not long and a bit dangerous meaning this trail is not ideal for people looking for a good rigorous workout.

Prayerchild,It was OK,There were a lot of children there for class outings and that is about the level of interest. The Star of India is there which was the best feature - along with the ship used for the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies. There was an old sub that looked suspiciously like it might sink at any moment and a bargelike boat with displays. The parking was terrible. ,30,Maritime Museum of San Diego,March 2019

Campers1963,Interesting and informative,"There are many vessels to explore, but it is self guided. Having someone to answer questions would have added to the experience.

BZimm08,Great Collection!,"I was debating going here on my last day after walking past The Star of India. I made the decision and went, glad I did. They had ten or so ships on display everything from merchant ships to ferry's to submarines. I found all of them to be different and interesting. It was fun to walk through the submarine, glad I never worked on one. It was interesting walking on board the naval ship and then The Star of India and seeing what life was like while at sea. The ferry boat was surprising, so elegant inside, didn't even feel like you were on a ship. In the end, I am glad I made the decision to tour these vessels.",50,Maritime Museum of San Diego,March 2019

I was intrigued by 2 current small exhibits -- one about an artist who had taught at a local college and also tried to establish a separate nation called the State of Art and another about women in San Diego called ""Herstory"".  There's also an interactive exhibit geared for children about Marston, and a city history video plays almost hourly.

Sandy B,Father Pat is wonderful ,"We had been members of St Joseph for about 17 years but had been going to another parish for a year. We heard great things about the new pastor at the cathedral, we decided to go back and see for ourselves. Father Pat is the best thing to happen to the parish in years. His homilies are delivered from the heart without notes and are timely and seem to be just what you need to hear at the right time. The Lord is working through him for sure. The church interior has been redone and is bright and welcoming. Father Pat is genuinely interested in the people. He just hired a new music director and wants the music to befit the beauty of the Mass. This is a multi-cultural parish with something for all. ",50,St. Joseph Cathedral,July 2016
Shannte H,Fun but uncomfortable ,My spouse and I attended the San Diego Soul Fest at the Valley View Casino Center.   Not enough signage to direct you to will call.  We waited outside in line a whole your and a half before we could go inside. Doors were supposed to open at 7pm. This gentleman next to us in line fainted due to waiting in line.  The seats are very uncomfortable due to this being a hockey arena.   Not good if your waiting over an hour between sets for the next artist to set up.  ,30,Valley View Casino Center,April 2017
jiki3,"Great museum, beware of parking scam","Really a great museum, so much history!  But..beware the parking. I got a $42.50 parking ticket with 1hr 37 minutes left on the meter. The appeals process is only in writing, sounds like it can take 6 weeks. I have picture of the meter but have little faith I will not end up to forking out $42.50. I wonder how many tourists are fleeced like this? Part of me thinks the time it will take to appeal this will not be worth it, that may be their way of generating tons of extra $$$. My advice, go to the museum but take pictures before you leave the meter with a date and time stamp on the pic. I have not found out  yet if my pics can prove anything. I think they have you by the short hairs!",20,Maritime Museum of San Diego,February 2019
JenRed2014,Very Interesting ,"There are so many ships to see at the Maritime Museum, it’s really impressive. There is a little bit of everything here: two submarines, steam boats, racing sail boats, a caravel, and multiple huge tall ships. The “Surprise” was beautiful and fun to learn about. The Russian sub has a cool history and a bunch of hatches to climb through. The “Star of India” is huge and surprisingly fancy for what it was. Also, there is a big naval display inside the main area/steam ship, including an engine room tour down below and a very pretty upstairs. Given that so many things were being worked on, I gave it four stars, but that is the nature of maritime restoration...does it ever really end? ",40,Maritime Museum of San Diego,February 2019

GlobalGypsy_13,"Fresh, Cheap Fish","Go to the newly opened dockside seafood market on the San Diego waterfront and adjacent to Seaport Village on Saturday morning between 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., There you can buy freshly caught fish and seafood from local fisherfolk, most of whom use sustainable fishing methods. Since many restaurants also purchase here, go early for the best selection and prices that are way below any other commercial outlet in the city that I've found.  Most are sold whole but some are already cut in pieces or go to one of the stalls where fish can be scaled, cut and grilled for a nominal charge.  Don't be confused with the nearby spot on the bay that a sign proclaims as Tuna Harbor; you're almost there when you go to the parking entrance to Seaport Village and then walk back to the dock on your right.",50,Tuna Harbor Dockside Market,June 2015

Then when we were done we'd clean our mess and drive home. Now-a-days the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak, and older. Why is youth wasted on the young?

It is about the same distance as the closest public parking on Harbor Island. Hopefully, SAN is able to complete their construction soon so that accessing the airport is a bit more direct. Currently, the only way to get to terminal one is to walk down to Harbor Island Dr. and turn in there. It is about a half mile, and there is plenty of sidewalk. I wouldn't recommend the walk for travelers with anything heavier than a roll-aboard.",30,Spanish Landing,July 2013
danz4x,Gulls game!,We went to a Gulls game here. The building is a bit old but the seating was good. the food inside was good. Tried the lobster bites!! they were great. the arena does get very packed due to the lack of management properly using rope lines keeping the main aisle open for safety. it took a long time to navigate thru all the lines to make it once around the arena. Lines went strait across the aisle. people did not make room for people walking. Most arenas use a rope line keeping the aisle clear for people walking. This could be a major issue god forbid anything happening. I wish the management would look into this issue and make changes. ,30,Valley View Casino Center,April 2016

There is often a long line for tickets, so here's a tip: walk around the line and head straight into the museum/gift shop (to the left of the tickets window). Even if you aren't buying anything else, they will sell you tickets at the gift shop counter. And you can read up on the cool history of Belmont Park.",50,Giant Dipper Roller Coaster,January 2015

The roller coaster itself is a compact wooden coaster that would probably never be large enough to fit in a real amusement park like six flags.

Jeffree I,Beer at the History Center,Many people don't realize it but San Diego is a huge beer mecca. There are over 30 microbreweries in the county and almost that many set to open in the next year. Therefore it makes perfect sense that The History Center in Balboa Park is running a special exhibition on San Diego Craft Breweries in San Diego County. It's extremely well done and helps visitors gain a better understanding of how this industry literally mushroomed throughout San Diego county and has become a well-deserved source of pride for the region.,50,San Diego History Center,May 2013

rondonel,Back to the Days of the Wild West,"Upstairs, you can actually sit in a restored stagecoach, press a button and the scenery moves with a commentary as if you are riding in it.  You can also rock it to simulate movement or play driver by sitting on the front of the coach.  This is a fascinating museum with things for children to do as well.  There is a toilet available in the basement with stagecoach pictures and that of the wild west in glorious technicolour on the walls.  So glad we managed to fit it in.

The museum is frankly just an ad for the other museums and attractions in Balboa Park. It advertises itself as history of the city, when really it just covers Balboa Park and the majority is just trying to get you to go to the zoo, literally half the museum is a bunch of stuffed animals they're pretending to bring back to health.",10,San Diego History Center,June 2016
Lvinstyle,An interesting walk back into time,It was amazing to see all the cool stuff from the old Overland Trail.   I never knew Wells Fargo started out as a supply and stage coach company.

It really gave an interesting perspective on how banking was handled in the old days. There is a very beautiful Wells Fargo stagecoach on display that is in great shape, and surely makes on appreciate the modes of travel that we enjoy today!

taryn0,Fun concert venue!,"My husband & I recently enjoyed a Maroon 5 concert at Viejas Arena. Seating was better than expected, & the arena made for a nice concert atmosphere. This was a different arena style than others we've visited in that all concessions & restrooms are outdoors around the bowl of the arena, but that might be a California thing due to the ideal weather much of the year. We parked about 6 blocks away for $10 in one of the garages about 1 1/2 hr before the concert & were able to leave without really any issues with traffic after the concert ended. Great experience overall.",40,Viejas Arena,April 2015

Heather P,Older but still a contender,"We visited the Arena this past weekend to see the Who.  I'd been there previously for a pre-season Laker's game (half empty) , but the Who was sold out, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  First, the good:  Getting into the arena through security was easy - there are a lot of entrances and they are all well staffed and efficient.  Granted, this venue is a third the capacity of PETCO Park, but after experiencing the nightmarish hour plus lines to enter PETCO, I was apprehensive.  Second, well placed and clean restrooms!  Third, plenty of concessions - lots of food & beverage choices as well as vendors selling the souvenirs.  Fourth, pretty decent viewing from most seats.  It's similar to the Forum rather than the Staples Center as a concert venue.  Ok, the bad, it is older, so it's a bit rundown.  The parking lot is fine, but it's an easy 40 minutes to get to the freeway after the show (normally a 5 minute drive without concert traffic).  You can save $20 parking on the street, but those spots fill up a couple of hours before a show and if you park in a local business lot, you will get towed.",40,Valley View Casino Center,May 2016
101travelers,Old venue but good experience,"  Parking cost $20 and was easy enough to get in and out.  Staff is courteous.  Although older, facility is well maintained, plenty of staff and clean restrooms.  We usually attend concerts in Los Angeles so this was a good experience because it has a small seating capacity.  We had floor seats so we were close to stage so can't say how sound/view is from the two other levels.  Seats didn't look too steep and the concert set-up means they don't sell seats that don't have a good view of stage.  Stage is small so okay for individual performers or small band.  Restrooms located on ground floor, off to side of stage, so you don't have to go back upstairs - great! Didn't check out the food vendors. Overall a good experience.",40,Valley View Casino Center,June 2016

The first time we went we had to ride the coaster it was great fun, loved the experience, but wished I would have not done it. It put my neck out so badly I had migraines for the remainder of our trip. My husband had no problems at all, as he does not have any issues , go if you can you'll love it, but careful if you have neck\back issues, it's a rough ride but FUN!",50,Giant Dipper Roller Coaster,July 2015

ed_in_510,Very good overview of aspects of San Diego History,"As with any museum or such place, the exhibits rotate.  I had been to this History Center about three years ago, and it was completely different than what saw on my trip today.  Major point of the current exhibitions include a celebration of the 100 year anniversary of the San Diego Zoo, from different perspectives:  History, world outreach and endangered species protection, veterinary medicine, and even food consumption among the animals.  They also had a great exhibit celebrating the centennial of the Panama California Exhibition of 1915-16, and an exhibition celebrating one of San Diego's early architects. Who knows what they'll have when YOU visit, but do visit!!!",50,San Diego History Center,December 2016
Pnemiller,A very disappointing museum,This free museum in Balboa Park has little on the city's history other than the park and zoo.  It is set up poorly with information on walls that are so far away and poorly lighted that they cannot be read.  A city with this kind of history deserves a better museum.  On the day we visited there was a lot of construction and noise which was very distracting.,20,San Diego History Center,January 2017
JSS88,"Nice, small, museum.  Feature Exhibit in 2017 is History of SD's Jewish Community!","I particularly enjoyed the 2017 exhibit on the History of San Diego's Jewish Community. It is a very engaging and innovative exhibit with interesting timeline, family photos and an interesting take on what helped establish the Jewish Community in San Diego.",50,San Diego History Center,April 2017
interceptpubs,"Small museum with quirky exhibits, but not great coverage of city's history as a whole","This small museum hosts several temporary exhibits that, for the most part, focus on very specific aspects of San Diego history. When we there, there was an extensive exhibit on the city's Jewish community, another much smaller one on the Japanese San Diego experience or more precisely the WWII internment camps and some of the young Japanese men who still volunteered to serve and fight for the war effort, one on the history of the San Diego Zoo, and one on the life and work of local architect Irving Gill - a pretty eclectic lot to be sure. There was one smallish room focusing on the more general history of San Diego and a theater showing a fairly long (30 min?) film on the history of Balboa Park, which started with the origins of the park including the Panama-California Exposition (held in the park) but which ended with more of a chamber of commerce feel. If you are a local with an interest in one or more of the temporary exhibits, this might be worth visiting, but if you're looking for more of a detailed portrait of San Diego history as a whole, then their approach here will be somewhat disappointing. The good news is the price is basically free (they ask you when you enter to consider ""paying forward"" by making a contribution to pay for a future visitor, but they don't push it), and there is a nice little gift shop with a few interesting books (we picked up a couple paperbacks, one on architect Gill's work and one of those little picture studies on Lindbergh Field). Overall, if you're really interested in all of the exhibits (and we'd recommend visiting their website to see what's on), you can possibly spend an hour or so looking through them - otherwise it'll be a pretty quick stop.",30,San Diego History Center,July 2017
Lynne0725,Expected More,We entered this museum and had a quick look-see only to be turned away by an employee and invited to come back during regular hours. Guess they open at 10 a.m. even though the door was fully open. Loved the original stagecoach and was able to snap a few pictures. Wish we had had the time to return and learn about the history of Wells Fargo. Lesson learned: Old Town opens at 10 a.m.!,30,Wells Fargo Museum,October 2016

Parking for students is free if they have a pass, they rip you outside of that for like $15 for a spot in the structure next to the arena: students without a semester pass can buy permits by the hour, but really anyone can. If you see one of the yellow permit boxes, you might buy an all day permit for $10 and try to save $5 but they'll try and argue; can't argue you're a campus visitor. Can also take a trolley onto campus and avoid all of that hassle. Arena is nice and decently sized, that was our biggest game this season so crowd was awesome. ",40,Viejas Arena,December 2017

I loved seeing the Star of India- The only other sailing ship I have been on is the Mayflower which is teeny tiny and dark so it was nice to see later bigger ships to have an idea what most people actually traveled on when they sailed the ocean for weeks. Also the Russian submarine is cool. Just a surprisingly cool place to visit. We had to park our stroller outside as you are climbing stairs and ladders to go on the ships, submarines, and between decks.

The entire park is situated on a grassy slope so, while it is a great place to picnic, you probably want to leave the tents and tables at home and stick to just a blanket.

I have ridden a lot of roller coasters, but this one actually scared me a bit. After you get off, you can wander around and look at the rest of this old style amusement park. There are other rides, carnival games, and lots of junk food. Admission to the park is free, as is the limited parking.

Charles C,Fantastic chance to see Craftsman architecture in its original state.,"As a finish carpenter and furniture builder that spends most of his time building Craftsman style homes and furnishings I was in hog heaven when we visited Marston House.  What a tremendous gift this was to the city of San Diego.  If the names Gustav Stickley and Dirk Van Irp mean anything to you, then you owe it to yourself to get there and see what is on display.  The craftsmanship that went into building this home was of the highest level.  There are many innovative features that were built into the home.  The docent that led the tour we took also gave a good deal of history from that period of San Diego.  Aside from the house and furniture there are also many other works of art and collections of Native American items.  There is so much to see and the tour only touches on a few of the rooms.  The house exemplifies one of the key features of Craftsman style houses, that of using small and medium sized rooms to give a sense of intimacy rather than today's trend of having few or no walls to give a sense of open space.  Walking through the home one would never guess that it is nearly 9,000 square feet.  There is a small gift shop nearby in the former carriage house.  The formal garden looked beautiful but we were not able to wander through due to our rushed schedule.  We'll save that for next time.",40,Marston House Museum,April 2015

The tour guide explained the architectural features of the house and pointed out antique pieces of furniture and art in the house, however the furnishings are not original so it does not feel ""lived in."" I wish they had told us more about the Marston family so that we could really get a day in the life. They had changed exhibits to feature the Centennial of some 1915 local event... I can't remember exactly. Most of the upstairs rooms were empty except for memorabilia from this event. We were not necessarily gung ho about local history, so we would have preferred to hear more about the architecture or family. It's really just a matter of taste. The tour is only about 20 minutes long. If you just want to see a neat old house and kill some time, you can pay $15 to walk through. ",30,Marston House Museum,June 2015
Tripsterchick,Interesting docent-led tour,"Marston was actively interested in historic preservation – he bought the site of the presidio, San Diego’s first European settlement, turned it into a park and gave the park to the city – so he would surely have approved of his family’s decision to donate the house to the city of San Diego in 1987.",40,Marston House Museum,January 2015

GlobalGypsy_13,Cool Summer Fun,"It's always fun and informative to take a global craft trip by visiting the Mingei Intl. Museum in Balboa Park as this museum collects and displays crafts from around the world. Even the elevator shaft is decorated with metl ""chaps"" used in making Indonesian batik.  But there's an added incentive now when the cool price for admission for the summer months is only $10.00 and there are many indoor activities -- trunk shows, demonstrations, talks, and films. On July 22 you could catch a Indian textile talk in the Warren Auditorium in the morning, an ikebana demonstration at 5 followed by a Japanese film at 6 p.m. And all weekend there's a textile trunk show by a local artist in the museum shop.  So don't delay, but beat the heat by visiting the Mingei for a cool time this summer. ",50,Mingei International Museum,July 2016
jalapenohotel,Not what I expected,"This place looks to be set up well.  Unfortunately, I imagined something different after reading a quick description about contemporary folk art and seeing colorful skull picture on internet site. Entry was not cheap, and my husband and son were done under 20 minutes.  My daughter and I tried to make it work, but were very disappointed after our earlier in the day, successful experience at MOPA, Museum of Photographic Arts.

The last week of November, they had the same Danish artist as in July in the main gallery: furniture, pottery, and sculpture.  There is also a textile exhibit downstairs, and upstairs, a wonderful display of tools for all uses.  Also upstairs was a display from their permanent collection and one of tools to make Japanese lacquer ware.  There are films that enhance your understanding of the displays.  The gift shop has lovely items for sale.",50,Mingei International Museum,November 2016

Jim C,Not Enough Here,"The photos are decent, but I was struck by how small the museum is. I guess I didn't feel cheated since the admission for this was included as part of my two-day San Diego pass. But if I had to pay a separate admission for this I might have felt cheated, depending on what the admission price is. Another unusual thing seemed to be that a good portion of the museum consisted of two special exhibits. I have never seen a museum before where it seems like over half of what is there is a special exhibit. I am not sure what they replace these with later.",30,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),July 2016

Andrew M,One of the Highlights of our trip to San Diego,This Arts-Crafts home on the Northern edge of Balboa Park is a hidden Gem. The gentleman who gave the tour was very knowledgeable about both the House and San Diego History. My wife and enjoyed the one hour tour and were very fortunate to be the only two guests on the tour. We were able to ask as many questions as we liked and our guide really knows about Arts-Crafts Homes and the local area. So much of the house is original and most of furniture is either original or from the early 20th Century. The house is a great place to start if you are interested in San Diego history. The orginonal owner George Marston was intrumental in developing the area. The stark pictures of the tree less Marston House house from 1905 gives you glimpse into what San Diego would look like without all the irrigation that allows for all of vegatation to grow. The old Carriage house acts as Visitor Center and Gift Shop.,50,Marston House Museum,August 2014
Iambic,Good History Lesson,The only down side to the visit was the worker who was selling tickets in the gift shop who was bossy and gave every indication of disliking people.  Odd for someone in a customer service role.,40,Marston House Museum,September 2014

akfox7,Another Balboa Park treasure.,This is located within balboa park. We visited here as a part of a field trip while i was going to school for interior design.

We went to Balboa Park to see the art museum there.  Luck of the draw, it was day they were normally closed.  Walked over to MOPA...pay what you like to enter...nice.  Very pleasant experience looking at various types of photography.  Enjoyed historical stories behind some of the photographs.  We went to International Mingei in the afternoon, and were very disappointed.  My daughter returned to MOPA with her father.  MOPA was a nice, quaint surprise that saved the day, TWICE!!

HRH T,Arts & Craft Preservation,"It was a beautiful day to stroll through this Arts & Craft preservation project and to learn about the Marston family and their influence on neighboring Balboa Park.  Our docent-guide worked very hard in a limited time to bring the family stories to life while highlighting the house & rare furnishings.  There are fine examples of Stickly furniture, some one of a kind.  While the house was donated to the city, the ""Friends"" have been instrumental in helping to preserve & furnish this piece of history, while opening the house to tours so all can see their progress.  They do have more work ahead of them as it is not complete by any definition, but they seem a committed and avid group.  An interesting addition to our time in San Diego.",40,Marston House Museum,September 2013
aakbba,A wonderful house,"If you like to see what other architects did who were influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright, here is a chance. Very nice woodwork and great pieces of furniture! We had a great tour guide, and our group was only 4 people! The gardens were also quite nice! Hope more people support it by visiting it.",50,Marston House Museum,November 2013
332ThomasS,Rushed,"We were in San Diego for a convention and decided to explore the Balboa Park which has the Marston Home in its confines. The docent was very knowledgeable, about the home and its owner, a department store magnet at the turn of the 20th century. This arts and crafts home is on the national register and its architect is a contemporary of Frank Lloyd Wright, both apprenticing to Louis Sullivan in Chicago. We saw similarities in style. The docent spent a lot of time on the life of Marston and his family which may have been more interesting to the locals than we as out-of-towners. The tour was billed at 45 minutes. Ours lasted an hour and at that was rushed and had too little time for discussion and questions. Organizers may wish to consider two levels of tours as is done in Falling Water.",40,Marston House Museum,November 2013
ianjc,Hard to rate,"This house is billed as 'one of the ten most important Arts and Crafts houses in North America.'  There are a few things wrong with that. Nice house, but not typical Arts and Crafts. Not even typical Craftsman, although it’s full of Craftsman style furniture, which the guide insisted was all Stickley. Maybe. It was designed to be a Tudor Revival house in 1908, but they changed architects, and the new one wanted to build a Craftsman house, which was all the rage at the time, but as the shell was completed he had to content himself with removing the fake half timbering and adding a few Craftsman details to the interior.So it's not really an Arts and Crafts house.  Good tour, though, and not terribly expensive. You learn a lot about the owners and the history, mostly because there's not much to say about the interior detailing. The tour does not include the exterior, but again, there's not much to say about it, unless the guide wanted to explain what a real Arts and Crafts house would look like and where this one differs. But it was interesting enough. Gift sore has a great variety of Arts and Crafts and Craftsman books.",30,Marston House Museum,November 2013
130adriennes,A unexpected delight!,"The Mingei Museum is a hidden gem! Filled with folk art from around the world, there are surprises and delights at every turn. Especially wonderful is Alice Hudson's ""Procession"", a parade of tiny whimsical people and creatures that is perfectly displayed on the second floor...right at eye level, so adults and children both can lose themselves in the magic.  But there is so much more: pottery, glass, quilts & masks.  Don't miss this Balboa Park museum!",50,Mingei International Museum,November 2015
culdesacSanDiego,A gem of a museum,"We visited this inviting museum and look forward to returning soon.  The American folk art exhibit of walking sticks is fascinating.  Loved Alice Hudson's ""Procession"" and want to bring grandchildren to see it, as well as Hudson's ""A Palace for Wednesday"" and accompanying video on display.  They would be better displayed in a more prominent location, especially the ""palace""...

travelingjamie,Crafty Museum,"The Mingie Museum is one of many museums located in the Balboa Park area.  It's actually right in the center of Balboa Park. You have to be into crafty things and folk arty things to appreciate this museum.  The Charles and Ray Eames chairs were my favorite things in the museum; they have two.  It takes about 30 minutes to walk around.  They also have benches and a table made by the Japanese artist George Nakashima (I think I'm spelling that correctly).  Currently, on the bottom floor they have quite the collection of walking canes.  I kept imagining them as giant wands from Harry Potter to make it a little more fun.  Overall, if you're in to this type of thing, this museum is worthy of your time.  Otherwise, Balboa Park itself is much more interesting to walk around.",30,Mingei International Museum,November 2015

Alexandra T,This is it?,"Luckily we got in for free with the Bank of America free museum visit program. If not, we would have asked for our money back. There are about four rooms with a few photographs in each that were average. But the biggest draw seemed to be the screens showing people being interviewed about childhood dreams and memories.

KMA3boys,Great Food and Attentive Staff,We enjoyed dinner here one night with visiting San Diego on vacation. We had our 3 children with us and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.

SB1114,Worth a visit:),"We finally made it to this museum, after numerous visits to the area.  Definitely be aware of their dates and hours of operation.  GPS got us there with no problem and (probably because it wasn't a weekend) we were able to find street parking nearby.  Their website gives directions also to a lot somewhere in the vicinity that shuttles you there, and I suspect that might be necessary on weekends or summertime.  The garden tours are only on weekends in the off-season, so we weren't able to do that, but you can wander the grounds on your own.  We really enjoyed the house tour, and learned a lot about the patriarch of the family.  He had a lot to do with the way the city developed, and we had never heard about his role previously.  The house itself is a great example of how a wealthy family lived.  Many kudos to the last Marsten to live there, who donated the home and grounds to be preserved for a glimpse into history for us all.",40,Marston House Museum,February 2013

sjansenavon,Beautiful grounds,"I am sorry I cannot comment on the museum itself, however, my brother in law booked the outdoor garden area for his 60th birthday.  It was a perfect location, and a great space for his 60+ guests.  We gathered in the morning for coffee and pastry, then headed out on a street hike for about an hour or so.  This included walking over a suspension bridge that goes over a small canyon, and then a footbridge that takes you back over at the end of our hike.  We all gathered back at the outdoor garden, and they had it completely set up with a family making fresh tacos, and serving all the condiments to go with it.  There is a small overhang that was perfect for setting up their small beer and soft drinks bar.  The restrooms are also about 15 feet from the main grass area.

It was hard to choose between all of them, but the exhibits here sounded the most interesting for this visit.  Every exhibit was outstanding, and even if you don't enjoy art museums that much, most everyone would enjoy the unique exhibits here.  Folk art, craft and design from cultures all over the world are displayed.  Mingei stands for Art of the World and Art of the People.

gryphgirl,Not worth the entry fee,"I visited this museum after reading all the rave reviews on tripadvisor, but I was very disappointed with it.  It's really small, so not worth the entrance fee, unless you get the 7 day pass to the park.  I love photography but I must have gone at the wrong time because the photos on display were unappealing and by no means would I call them art.  They switch exhibitions regularly so maybe if I went back a month later I would like the work better.  I was very disappointed, and this is the first time that I went with what tripadvisor travellers had written and completely disagreed.  There is no way this museum should be ranked as high as it is, it was the worst one I visited at the park!",20,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),May 2012
Melissa A,"Fun place, great food!",Went here for dinner our first night in San Diego and loved it!  We ate upstairs in the open bar overlooking the ocean and could watch the Iowa game too.

Food was incredible!,50,PB Ale House,January 2016
johnbayesa,Great collection of contemporary and historical crafts,"The craft scene is widely under appreciated by casual observers of the art world. The Mingei houses an excellent, rotating collection of crafts including furniture, musical instruments, fibers work, glass work, and other pieces. One of the highlights is the Chihuly chandelier hanging about the staircase. Well worth an hour of your time if you're strolling through Balboa, and definitely worth going out of your way if you're interested in craft art.",40,Mingei International Museum,March 2013
AlandDiane,A Charming Look at the Decorative Arts,"We discovered the Mingei on a free museum Tuesday.  And, we keep coming back.  First, the staff and volunteers are wonderful and so helpful.  Second, each exhibit is expertly curated so the theme flows from piece  to piece to piece.  And, most importantly, the often ordinary is taken to the level of the work of a master craftsman.  In the current exhibit, there are two guitars.  So, what?  A six string guitar is commonplace.  But, these two are limited edition Taylor made beauties with mother of pearl, abalone shell, and a variety of exotic woods.  These are something special to look at.  Takings the ordinary and elevating it to the sublime is what Mingei exhibits are all about.",40,Mingei International Museum,May 2013

Not just because I have visited places from the regions, although I was surprised to see Hungarian furnitures from the 19th century, but finding connections throughout the continents, eg. see the similar musical instruments from china,Indonesia,Africa and South America. My teenage girls not much appreciated the pieces but surely this is an exhibition that people with awerness of worldwide cultures would enjoy. also nice, that the exhibit is not overwhelming, easily could take one - one and a half hours.",50,Mingei International Museum,July 2013

Tinetina77,Happy Hour Always,My husband and I have been here a couple of time during happy hour and we just love the items on their menu. We have tried their ceviche and nacho and happy hour drink items. Their sangrias are delicious and when it is seasonal the octoberfest beers are addicting. There is a specific pumpkin beer where the bartender will put cinnamon and sugar on the rim! YUM YUM YUM.

My hope was that a museum like this would be give some inspiration to him.  I was very wrong.  Though the admission price was cheap at 6 dollars, it was not worth it.  we walked the whole gallery in like 20 minutes.  I would hesitate to call this a museum due to its small size.  And half of the gallery was dedicated to photographs taken by children in middle school.    I would not revisit this ""museum""  and would caution anyone who thinks this is anywhere close to being a museum.  There is a Museum of Art and a Natural History Museum close by would be far better choices.",20,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),January 2012

Staff really friendly and happy to answer all our daft questions about what to do/where to go. The menu isn't extensive but it's good 'pub grub'. Recommend the fish tacos. One thing if you're going for a drink or food in the evening then you'll need ID - because it attracts a young crowd then, they're hot on checking you're over the drinking age. As I'm in my 50's it was unexpected (flattering maybe?) to be asked for ID and I didn't have my passport or drivers licence with me so was turned away. It seemed a bit top heavy but they have to be strict in case under cover cops are checking their process.

Now they have two major exhibits going.  One, Boundless, is a major exhibition of 11 California artists displaying their work, much of which is very thought-provoking.  The second major exhibit is an exhibit of photography done by youth of the region, celebrating animals among us, both exotic and not-so exotic.  This exhibit was inspired by the centennial of the San Diego Zoo, but the photos covered a range well beyond the confines of the Zoo.  Very special.

I circled through the images several times; I have to say it was the highlight of my day in the park.

Lest this distract you, let me quickly say that the food makes the strain on your ears and the constant movement of bodies through the restaurant worth it.  It’s a gathering and drinking place for young people which we are not.  They love the ambience and you will get used to it if you don’t fit this age group.  We shared a special that included an appetizer tray of fried calamari, shrimp, lemon slices and artichokes.  This was followed by fish and chips, the fish breaded just right.  Our dessert was a lemon and blueberry tort.  Our friends shared a pizza and beer.  There is a plethora of beer choices, as well as wine by the glass.

bpollard61,I love this retreat and what they do!,"Children's nature retreat is an amazing place to visit.  Unlike a typical zoo, the animals interact with each other in entertaining ways. They are always quite active when we've been. And their stories are posted to read at their enclosures.  They have a nice picnic area and lots of shade. There are no big hills to trek, making it an easy place for anyone to access. We take a picnic lunch when we go which extends our time there. I especially love the opportunities that the retreat provides to school children and other children who might not otherwise have been able to visit were it not for their program. I would visit everyday if I could! ",50,Children's Nature Retreat,August 2017

They have a good variety of animals and the best thing is that you actually get to interact with the animals by feeding them. We were able to feed camels, ostriches horses, mini horses, goats, pigs and more. They gave each one of us in our family our own huge bucket of barley to feed the animals with and then when we were done, they offered us more food to feed them. It’s also nice because it’s a self guided tour, so you can go at your own pace. We definitely plan on going back again. ",50,Children's Nature Retreat,July 2017

Great-Flying-Owl,A wonderful gem in Little Italy,I've been coming to the San Diego Firehouse Museum once in a while since the late 1960's. It is a gem of a museum located inside what was once San Diego's Engine 6 quarters and Repair Facility. When my children were young is was easily worth a visit once or twice a year. As an adult I still visit from time to time when I have a bit of free time and am in the area.,50,The Firehouse Museum,January 2015

Linda F,Awesome and Informative!,"Having lived in San Diego many years, I am almost ashamed to say I had never been here..when friends visiting from Long Beach suggested it...Glad they did..what an incredible house and grounds...but, the history given by a very well informed docent (Lois) made it even more enjoyable..Mr. Marston was a self-made man, not inheriting his money, nor marrying it..He worked for it and gave back to the community...great history here..and of course surrounded by our beautiful Balboa Park.  Suggest parking on Balboa Drive, just off 6th avenue near Upas.  Enjoy! (tours are every 30 mins)",50,Marston House Museum,August 2016

C0dys_Dad,Make a point to visit the Museum of Photographic Arts,"I stumbled on this museum and loved the current exhibit.  I've traveled to Asia and Europe, but must admit the pictures and locations of the photos in the current exhibit were thought provoking about how different but alike many areas of the world are.  The museum is not large, so even if with children or teens I think you can make it through without cries of boredom.  On the Genesis exhibit on display now, I loved the pictures of birds in the south Atlantic, and the cattle herding tribes in Africa.  Pictures of arctic mountains - Alaska and Siberia were incredibly stunning.  With rotating exhibits its worth stopping in again.  There is a guide to what you can take pictures of and what you cant - so don't be ashamed if you see something worthwhile, they let you take pictures so you can bring it home with you.  Just look for the markers to be sure.  Also of note - right outside is a bathroom and a cafe, so you can rest and recharge without trouble.",50,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),August 2017
Emma B,Powerful images from around the globe,"My favorite museum in San Diego. I love photography so this museum was great for me. Even if you're not a photography, check it out.

They have some great polaroid and film cameras for sale.",50,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),August 2017
racheltU9983QQ,Not my thing ,"The art museum was closed, so we came here instead. I must admit that I am not really into photography, so this wasn’t my cup of tea. But honestly, for the price they charge, it wasn’t a huge museum. Not worth it to me. ",20,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),November 2017
profits101,quality presentation and venue,"My expectations are usually low when walking into a museum dedicated to photography, but the exhibits here were engaging, informative, and varied. In terms of art, I feel for photographers in terms how they will make art from their chosen medium... there are always a lot of ""tricks"" or exaggerations, and sometimes you wonder where the photography is. Like other exhibits, this had some of those qualities but I kept on looking and still found it all interesting and worth the time. As noted to me, admission is with donation, and it was suggested $5.00USD was the baseline - price seemed fair. The venue is not huge, but large enough to contain 3 scoped-out exhibits. Pretty good bookstore/shop if you want to check it out also.",40,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),February 2018
JAMA293,"Can't call it ""art""","Generally, art can be described as being ""beautiful"" but only one or two images I saw in this museum could fit that description.  The rest of the exhibits (aerial photos of the Mexico/US  border area, fat naked man photos, naked woman rolling around on the floor with her children, suicide notes displayed on the marquees of dilapidated/derelict movie theaters, blurry photos of Mexico City) left me shaking my head.  I would not recommend a visit to this museum. Museum store was nice.  Just go there and call it a day.",10,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),February 2018

Scotland222,Rooftop Seating is the Draw Here,"This is your average beach bar and restaurant. They have an open, rooftop deck that is usually packed with people so seating is hard to come by. I had a large group with me so we had to settle for sitting downstairs in the bar area. The server we had was just okay. We had to wait for awhile to just get silverware for everyone after the food had come. It is close to the beach so it can get pretty busy at times. The food was your basic bar food. I had ordered a flatbread that had their barbecue brisket on it with carmelized onions, some cheese and maybe mushrooms. I would order this again but without the brisket on it. The brisket was so fatty that it made it difficult to chew which made it completely unappetizing to me. The rest of my friends said that the food they had ordered was just okay, with the exception of two people that had ordered the same thing which was some kind of taco. They both liked their tacos. If your main reason is to get drinks and just snack on average food then this is the place to be.",30,PB Ale House,June 2018

ScotProf,How could you NOT enjoy this?,"We are San Diego residents. If you're non-residents, visiting the town, and want to do something a little different form the usual (beach, zoo, plays, etc), try this. Spend the afternoon in Old Town, eat at one of the several local Mexican places, then go so see Sebastian in ""Intimate Miracles"". Entertaining, light-hearted, and fantastic sleight of hand. It's a very small room, with only three rows of seats, each with about 8-10 chairs. We were in the 2nd row, and were maybe 6-8 feet from the action, so you are close enough to see what he is doing - or, more to the point, close enough NOT to see how the @#$& he is doing what he's doing. Really, some of the stuff is just wonderful. A talented guy, doing what he loves, and doing it well. He involves the audience, calling some people down to join him - but it's all very comfortable, and fun. The show is about 70 minutes long (this includes a 5-10 minute intermission). There's a nice little bar & seating area outside, and you can bring your drink into the performance. GO TO THIS SHOW.  You won't regret it.",50,Red Spade Theater,November 2013

JanHana,Wow! Art and Handicrafts from Around the World,"Going to Mingei Museum is like taking a trip to foreign countries. You're transported there with their amazing displays. There was a Japanese sign display and it really was like being in Japan! There was a very helpful docent there who explained some of the background behind the displays. These were actual authentic signage with complementary photos in the gallery. Very well done!  The Chihuly glass chandelier that graces the stairs is gorgeous! We continued our trip around the world upstairs with modern crafts and cool jewelry, ancient Mayan ceramics and art pieces, Oaxacan and Mexican folk art that were so colorful and fun--it made you happy to view them. There were things for everyone as there were some beautiful fairy fantasy crafts and displays. I preferred those exotic camel dressings! It brought me right back to India with the colors and how they displayed the wares.  Don't forget their gift shop!

I never knew about this place just a short walk from the depot. I have been to the big Stone Brewery in Escondido. This is just a mini version of that but has 20 taps with some inside tables. But what makes this place just as special as the Escondido one is the tucked away beautiful patio featuring the natural elements of wood and stones. Just a wonderful relaxing vibe. There's no food at this site but a small restaurant was next door and it's ok to bring your own food over. Next time I am in this area I will be back for sure.

The arrogance of these people is breathtaking - the permanent collection is far too important for the general public to be able to see it.

This is definitely a must see if you are in Old Town playing tourist.",50,Seeley Stables,October 2016

DebKr60,Daily Mass at 7:30am...Perfect Way to Start Your Day!!!,Our Lady of The Rosary Church is beautiful. The priest are very friendly and very nice!

When you are done it is a 5 minute walk into the heart of Little Italy.  One of my favourite places in the USA.,50,Our Lady of the Rosary Church,December 2016
GlobalGypsy_13,Smells and Bells = Slice of Life,"Nesteled in the heart of Little Italy is this Italian parish.  Here on the second Sunday of every month at 4 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon you can attend a Latin mass and hear an amazing choir. This street front church is across the street from a small park that hosts boci ball and at the next corner is an Italian cafe with outside tables.  The parish hall here has homemade bake sales and daily you can find am religious bookstore/gift shop in this complex.  The only downside is the limited on site parking and scramble for street parking in Little Italy. So for a slice of Italian life without the hassle of an international flight, go to Little Italy on a Sunday afternoonm for an authentic taste.",50,Our Lady of the Rosary Church,January 2017
Kiamom,Church Visit,"Noticed the door of the church was open while we were walking around Little Italy.  We stopped in to say a prayer.

ERICW755,Awesome Course That is Ever-Changing,"This course is supposedly one of the most played courses in the world, I wouldn't doubt it.  There are always a ton of people whenever I visit (mid-morning/early afternoon) but things tend to move rather quickly.  Every Monday they change where the holes are located so make things a bit more challenging.

Such a fun stop if you are walking around sea port village. $10 for 5 wine samples and $20 for 10 wine samples and you get to keep the glass. Completely worth the money. The employees are very good at there jobs and know a lot about wine. They are friendly and easy to talk to. I have been twice and will continue to go every time I am in the San Diego area.

A TripAdvisor Member,"Great venue, great line-ups!","If you're coming to town, North Park is a great fun neighborhood and how awesome to have a historical theatre with great music right in the middle of it!  Huge parking garage across the street, $5 regular but ask them for validation at the exit doors and it's free!  They have a bar, taco concession stand, and a smoking patio in the theatre. Attached is West Coast Tavern where they have dancing, more bars, open till 2am and a delicious menu (kitchen open til midnight, every night), and as a guest of the theatre you are free to go back and forth throughout both bars. General Admission, so standing room only. They also offer plenty of ADA seating. Air conditioning vents come out of the floor throughout so it stays comfortable in there. Security checks purses and does patdowns so you know you'll always be safe here. They're booking bigger and better acts everytime I look--this place has come along way with the new owners and it's a beautiful thing!  Not many classic venues like this in San Diego... So glad they revamped this old theater--great sound and not a bad view in the house thanks to their tiered levels, great for short gals like me. Love love love!",50,The Observatory North Park,February 2017
Kelly A,Concert venue for Alina Baraz,Fun spot for a concert. VIP service upstairs was fabulous. Courteous wait-staff. Bathroom line wasn't too bad but did exist. I liked that there were so many bars placed throughout which kept the social lube flowing. The concert was spectacular. Casual space and everyone was comfy in jeans. Location is easy access. I will be back here in June for another concert - that's how much I enjoyed the space. ,40,The Observatory North Park,April 2017
SoCalOregonian,"TIGHT SECURITY FOR GOJIGA, GREAT VENUE","We attended the Gojiga concert at this venue on 10/19. Parking is available in a garage nearby, for a flat rate of $5. We were patted down by security prior to entry into the venue. After entry, we were in SRO area; this area afforded good sight lines to the stage. Sound system was good, but warm-up bands “Code Orange” and “Torche” had a little too much bass and it distorted their play. Gojira’s show was fantastic, great sound and visuals. Great place to catch a concert, just be aware of the tight security.",40,The Observatory North Park,October 2017

Outside atmosphere is chill and inviting even though it's downtown and close to the train station. Lots of Stone beers on tap and atmosphere is chill and inviting. However all of the beers were regular Stone offerings; there was nothing on the list that my husband hadn't already had in Kansas. In addition, the bartender wasn't very friendly; maybe it was a bad day or maybe it was us, though this was the only place where we felt this way.",30,Stone Brewing Tap Room - Kettner,June 2019

Somewhat more intimate interior than the other downtown breweries but has a very nice landscaped outside courtyard patio that most downtown breweries do not have. No food at this Stone Brewery location, just good beer. You can create your own brewery walking tour in this area and hit about 4-5 breweries.

Jo-Ann M,Lovely historic Arts & Crafts house in Balboa Park,"In a garden area on the edge of Balboa Park is the Marston House designed by Hubbard and Gill architects in 1905 for local business man and preservationist (in 1905!) and his family.  Mr Marston moved to CA from Michigan and was lucky that his early business eventually became Marston Department Stores.  Gill was into wellness and fresh air so there is lots of ventilation for air flow and porches and terrance opening out from most rooms.  It is a beautiful A & C house with lots of redwood and well proportioned rooms. It lacks the carved wood, glass and decoration of Pasadena's Gamble House.  The second floor has exhibitions on the Marston family (4 daughters and a son), the Marston Departments Stores (Hats and merchandise) and Mr Marston's achievements in preservation and local affairs.  Lovely gift shop and gardens.",50,Marston House Museum,February 2019
Ronnjonna,On the edge of Balboa Park,"It’s definitely worth a visit if you like craftsman style buildings and stories of a progressive family who contributed so much to San Diego. The tours are docent led and worth the price of admission. It is a house designed not for show but for quality and functionality. It reminded me of Wright with its alcoves and built in furniture. Gifted to the city when the last daughter moved out in 1987, it is well tended to by a group of volunteers. The grounds are beautiful although in February, there was not much blooming. Look for the Canary Island pines at the entrance- they are amazing. ",50,Marston House Museum,February 2019

Mark M,Afternoon visit ,"We had a guided tour of the Marston house with one of the preservationists the volunteers at the site. Very interesting history. Great visit with two minor caveats 1, tour guide got a little preachy and opinionated about preservation issues.  That can happen. Also 2 grounds and gardens could use some work.",40,Marston House Museum,August 2019
vagabondginger,Time Consuming Tour,"I wandered by accident upon this property and stopped into the Museum/Gift Shop. The House Tour price was $15 but I found a card on display advertising an Open House with free admission at the Marston House on Nov 2 to celebrate the 10 year anniversary. So I made a point to come back that day and walked around the gardens and then tried to go into the house but was stopped and told I had to sign up for a tour even though it was free. So then I had to wait for the docent to take the next group in 15 minutes later. I was not wearing my hearing device so didn't really feel I was going to get much out of listening but thought I could still just take a quick look around. There were just 5 off us but of course someone thought it was a good idea to have a small toddler with them. After a bit of whining they did decide to leave. The docent rambled on & on and I only saw a couple of the rooms and then asked how long the tour would be and was told 45 minutes. I just couldn't hang with that so I too left. It would have been handled much better if they had indeed just had an open house with a program and docents stationed around various places to answer questions and to monitor visitors like a museum would. Overall I wasn't impressed with the gardens and the house tour would have just taken more time than I would have had interest for. I'm sure San Diego was thrilled to have gotten this property donated and it is on the National Registry of Historical Places. And I understand that it takes money to maintain and preserve it, but it just wasn't worth 45 minutes of my time to tour it without being able to hear well even though it was free that day.",30,Marston House Museum,November 2019
Peterm5555,Uninteresting,"Exhibits include some various old photos, a bit of local history in a couple of small rooms  and a gift/book shop.  Disappointing overall.

simiseeu,Not what I expected,"The admission to this small museum is free, altho there is a sign suggesting a $10 donation.  I gave this amount, but to cover for both my wife and me.  In all honesty, it really wasn't worth it either.  It's not a large museum by any stretch and I was expecting a great deal more of creative photography than what was on display. Not worth it.",20,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),August 2019
GlobalGypsy_13,Photo Power,"If you like photos that are often cutting edge, this is the spot for you.  MOPA showcases its permanent collection through special exhibits.  The current show that takes up the majority of the space features Australia. In their small gift shop you can unique items related to photography as well as books on this subject.  My only quibble is that the restroom outside the front entrance is poorly maintained.  Admission is by donation, and MOPA is one of the museums that's included in the Balboa Park Explorer pass.",40,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),August 2019
DavidOfLA,Best for hardcore photographers and academics,"A beautiful little facility, with a nice exhibit space, but perhaps a little too much emphasis on avant-garde and experimental photography. My mind is open, but I would have preferred a little more ""traditional"" photography — i.e., images created with a camera and a lens. Still, I can't complain, as it is donation-only, it's 30-60 minutes to see it all, and all the work, even the stuff created with scratched film, x-rays, stereopticon, etc., was at least interesting to look at and think about, though for me, it was not very compelling.",30,Museum of Photographic Arts (MoPA),August 2019
GlobalGypsy_13,Click!,"MOPA within the Balboa Park complex of museums packs a mighty punch. In addition to various special shows that highlight parts of their collection, they have a movie theatre that hosts film series from various groups and a huge photo library that is open by appointment.

MichaelHamond,A Truly Amazing Experience,The venue is small but I thought it made the experience so much better than someone on a stage. Sebastian was very personable and connected with everyone in the audience.,50,Red Spade Theater,October 2019
Mike A,Good upclose magic show.,All the magic tricks were good. Front row seats were good. I did see how he did the classic ball tricks when put the larger balls under the cups. Everything thing else was great.,40,Red Spade Theater,October 2019
Tinafish,Unique Entertainment for Business Meeting Travelers,"We had a group of 13 people from out of state visiting for a business meeting. We were able to set up a private show on Wednesday night and it was absolute perfection. You can BYOB and socialize in the courtyard outside the theater before the show, then you head into a little room with 3 rows of seats. I sat front row, center so of course I was able to participate in a good portion of the show! Sebastian's show is beautifully choreographed: he switches from tricks with music in the background, to audience participation; from cards to cup-and-balls to flying tables seamlessly. This was just the perfect non-traditional activity and it was a delight to everyone in attendance. I was able to chat with Sebastian for a bit afterwards, and he's a very cool guy who works his tail off.",50,Red Spade Theater,October 2019

Dwane M,Excellent convention hotel in a beautiful location.,"We had a convention of roughly 800 attendees and the meeting facilities are more than adequate, the views out nearly every window are stunning and the rooms are more than adequate.  I stayed in room 1060 and some furniture needs to be replaced and the stopper on the shower does not operate properly. The lock to the balcony is barely on. Despite these flaws, there’s an incredible view from the room and the quality of the room otherwise is more than satisfactory.  The executive lounge is gorgeous and the swimming pool and marina area are very nice.",50,Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel Jogging Course,June 2019
Kevin D,Great location for a short visit,"Quick 3 day business trip . Part of visit was in Laguna Beach . Attraction was location as it was very close to airport . Best airport hotel I’ve ever been in , rooms with balcony , excellent views all side of hotels , big pool area , pub , excellent staff , if you have Marriott status their concierge lounge is among the best I’ve ever been in . Only downside is a little remote for dining places within walking distance (20-30 walk ) . Great hotel for short stay",40,Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel Jogging Course,June 2019
natehoog,Excellent views and hotel! ,"After a long week supporting a workshop, it’s nice to be heading home early tomorrow morning.

These views are relaxing... goodnight  ",50,Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel Jogging Course,August 2019

tokyohos,BALBOA TENNIS CLUB,"Wow, what a find!  This truly is an unbelievable tennis area. We did the drop in fee ($10.00 p.p. for the entire day/$8.00 for seniors).  We were immediately given a court to play singles on and then went to the challenge court (there were 2 challenge courts for intermediate levels and one for 4.5 level) and were able to start playing doubles with club members. If you don't have anyone to play with, no worries because you will be paired up with someone on the challenge courts. Everyone there was very kind to us.  Even though we had only been there for a few minutes, the club director, Colleen, came up and greeted us warmly and gave us a bit of background on the club.  I wish that I could join here full time, but I'll do the next best thing, which is to make sure to return next time that I am in S.D. and play often.  By the way, if you can't get the tennis channel at your hotel or AIRBNB and want to watch the Indian Wells tournament while you are in California, go to the clubhouse at Balboa tennis club.  They had it running the entire time.  Thank you for that, too.",50,Morley Field,March 2017

SamFrancisco4,Disc Golf,"This was my first ever pay to play disc golf course and it was well worth it. Very well maintained grounds and a ton of different basket locations. It’s one of the original disc golf courses and you can definitely see why it’s popular. It was busy and I’m glad I went on a weekday. My local guide (nice random local, shoutout to Mike!) said weekend rounds can take three hours. Great pro shop and nice community. Worth the stop if you’re a disc golfer and have the time for sure. Also, you can rent discs so if you can pack yours it’s pretty cheap to get a couple forms round. ",50,Morley Field,March 2019
Julie C,Nice stop on the bayfront,"We walked back to our hotel from dinner, about a 1.2 mile walk, and about half way back saw the little San Pasquale winery store, so stopped to have a glass of Sangiovese.

Highly recommended.",50,San Pasqual Winery Seaport Village,November 2018

Good prices to buy bottles. Lots of new wines I had never heard of. Fun wine accessories as well. Best to go early do not too crowded. ,50,San Pasqual Winery Seaport Village,June 2019
Donna W,Close up and personal,"This venue has the right sound balance and decor to bring you back to the times you saw musical acts in small venues, It was a theater at one time and still retains the old architecture that made so many of the old ones so grand. The only thing is that they do not have seats so you will be standing. Its OK though because you can sit and drink at the restaurant and bar before the show to give you enough energy to dance and sway to the entertainment. The Observatory books cool acts, some known...some newly discovered. Its fun, memorable, and makes you feel like a real rocker.",50,The Observatory North Park,September 2018
AdventureGirl6,Intimate rock venue,"Saw up and comers Greta Van Fleet here.  Great show but the Observatory sure packs the people in,  It was HOT.  Since it's a general admission venue, you can be front and center, if you want... just get there early.  They had good security with metal detectors.  It's connected to a bar too so you can get real drinks and take a break from the crowds.",40,The Observatory North Park,September 2018

However it's not too small and crowded  It's connected to a bar next door which is cool. The place looks great. 5 stars. Acoustics were on point.,50,The Observatory North Park,August 2019
cv91913,Love the Art Deco building,You have to love to dance - standing only - no bad place to stand. You can see stage throughout.  Cups at drinking fountain very nice touch.  Would have given 5 stars if they served a drinkable wine :(,40,The Observatory North Park,October 2019
Vanessa A,Great views,This is such a good place to spend a few hours. There are 5 different trails that you can take. We did all 5 and it took us about 3h with stops for photos and even spending some time at the beach. There is a lot of walking involved so take some water and snacks with you. If you like nature and beautiful scenery then this is a must do. You can park for free on Carmel Valley Road but then you still have to walk and climb for about 20 minutes to get to the first trail (Guy Fleming trail). ,50,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,September 2019

Shalometh,Way below my expectation,"Way below my expectations. First, parking- they charge $22 a night for self parking and blocked off a big chunk of parking space for valet. The funny thing is the self-parking spaces are too few. I found myself driving around for a parking space @11PM, finally parked by the curb on a dirt extension. Second- front desk staff- Some of them doesn t seem to know what they are doing, atleast in my case and I hope it is isolated. My card key had to be re-keyed twice- one it wouldn t open the room and two it wouldn t open the parking gate. The rooms are not that great either, they re especially cramped and small. The only good thing about the hotel is its location, which the owner had not input. I ve had much better experience with modest and much cheaper hotels.",10,Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel Jogging Course,August 2012
Smaim,"Close to Airport, and Great City Views!","I've stayed here for work several times.  First of all, the valet and front desk staff have always been so nice and helpful.   Last time I was there, I had spilled a protein shake all over the suit I was wearing en route to the hotel.  The valet guys helped me clean up the mess and gather my belongings, despite the fact that I was a disorganized disaster.   I got to the front desk and managed to drop some of my stuff and the front desk clerk picked it up, then offered my a room by the elevator :).   My room had a great view of the harbor and had a balcony.  The lobby area has a business center and a nice little bar and a Starbucks.  The pool area is really cool, with little fire pit areas with benches out by the water.   The workout facilities were being remodeled when I was there but I still used them and loved it because it was an open air gym.   Also, since the property is right on the harbor, there's a great running path along the water with a great view of the city.",50,Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel Jogging Course,August 2012
Wheretogowhattodo,Get ready to walk!,"This place is spectacular! Make sure you bring comfortable shoes, sunscreen, a hat, a camera, and water with you. There are many paths to walk along that are clearly marked, but, not an easy trek. You have to watch your step as the paths are not even. It's too bad though because you're too busy watching your step to be able to take in the incredible views without stopping.  If you're planning on covering all the paths to all the lookout points be prepared to walk for hours. There is no shade to hide under. The views are spectacular! Everytime we got to a lookout point we could see the next one and wanted to go there. So, we did and it was worth it!",50,Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,September 2019
emilywaves,Paid parking at the top !,"It’s worth the money to pay to park at the top. You also can park at the base but if you do that be prepared for a hike! The trails are sandy so I don’t recommend open sandals. Depending on what kind of weather you are used to I would also recommend a light pull over or layer you can tie around your waist. The gentlemen working in the visitor center seemed very helpful if you have questions. You could drive to the top and do a quick lookout.

Trails are easy, though not wheelchair accessible. No rock scrambles, just great views and interesting vegetation.

You are out on a peninsula and so have unparalleled panoramic views of the city of San Diego, harbor, open ocean and coastline. Some informative plaques at the top even point out the kelp forests out in the ocean. We enjoyed the lighthouse but wish the top hadn't been closed off. We were only able to go up a little bit of the spiral staircase to the second floor. Lots of great historical information inside about the operation of the lighthouse. Be aware that since you are so close to Mexico your cell phone might think you are there like mine did and I almost racked up roaming/international charges. Great little location to check out!",50,Point Loma,June 2019
cherylg365,Ok spot to visit.,"Point Loma is a nice view of the harbor, but there's not much to do there.  You cannot go up into the lighthouse, so it's just there to look at from the outside.  The Cabrillo monument is ok, again just something to look at.  The Military Cemetery is sobering and the best thing to view there.

Visiting this museum and seeing the young Marines was one of the major highlights of my recent trip to Southern California.  The museum is packed with USMC history from the earliest days up to WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan etc.  The displays were very interesting and informative.  Watching the young Marines going through close order drill brought back so many wonderful memories.  I also had the opportunity to talk to young Marines at the USMC Miramar Air Station and was quite impressed with the high caliber of the Marines and renewed my faith in the future of our country.",50,Marine Corps Command Museum,September 2018

It was cool to walk through the museum and see the displays through history as well as the advancements made over time. There were a lot of photographs of soldiers in different war periods, so it was great to see the honor given them. There's also an area that gives a very general experience of a recruit's first day on campus. After the museum, we were able to drive around the grounds and he pointed out what the different buildings were for, where his barracks were, and how he spent his days. It was a really neat experience.",40,Marine Corps Command Museum,September 2016
davidmP7608YO,Great Military Museum,"My wife and I have visited here about 3 years ago and came back again.  This is a about a 15 minute walk from Old Town so it is pretty easy to get to.  The area you walk through is somewhat industrial and there are some homeless around the area.  As you approach the gate a Marine MP approached us - we already had out our passports and we requested permission to come aboard to visit the museum. No issue.  The museum is very large and it is not uncommon the Marine recruits are going through as part of there history class.  The museum has evolved since last time and new exhibits have been added.  There are many photos, uniforms, weapons and other displays that will keep you interested.  There are dedicated exhibits to WW2, Korea, Vietnam plus more recent actions involving the Marine Corps.  The docents who for the most part seem to be there to teach the young Marines coming through are friendly and welcoming to civilian visitors. They leave a very positive image of the Corps with any visitor and if your lucky enough to be able talk to any of them - they will give you a great deal of interesting insight into the history of the Marines.  There is is also a well stocked gift shop on site.  Highly recommended if you are interested in the military.",50,Marine Corps Command Museum,October 2016
Marty R,A must-see for USMC history buffs,"I am a retired Marine, so getting the the base was no problem with my DOD ID; however, if you are not a US citizen, or if you are civilian coming on base at a time other than a recruit graduation week, I recommend you call the museum ahead of time on the day you plan to visit and ensure you have someone there who will be your sponsor or representative while you are on base. Once you gain access to the base, the museum is right inside gate 4. The museum is well organized with interesting and informative displays, and they have a few fun interactive displays, as well. The museum gift shop is great, so be sure to stop there before you leave. ",50,Marine Corps Command Museum,November 2016

etweeden,Where California Continued!,"We Americans reveal how local we are,sometimes.  We say that Presidio Park in California is the hill where on July 1, 1769 California started thanks to Father Serra and his soldier escorts under Portola.  Not true!  There was and remains a whole 'other' California, called Baja (lower) California in Mexico that had been settled and which had/has a whole other chain of Missions.  But with that said, the Persidio Park is the place where Alta (upper) California started all those years ago.  Nothing is left of it now.  The original fort has been replaced by a Spanish revival 1920s era museum of early California called the Serra Museum.  The original mission was moved further east up the San Diego River valley, closer to reliable water.  The museum shines as a white beacon to all, and a reminder of where our State started.  The Serra museum is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 0'am to 5 pm.  Admission $6.  No food or drink available, but it is just above Old Town San Diego, with many a shop and restaurant.  An excellent place to picnic!  Enjoy!",50,Presidio Park,April 2015

There's a nice gift shop too and my husband was thrilled to get a sweatshirt for a reasonable price. I'm not sure children would enjoy this experience...I'm guessing not; but, for those of us who lived through one or more of these eras, it's a very nice way to spend a morning or afternoon.

856marthaa,Vacation in San Diego,Steep stairs from parking to Junipero Serra Museum. Museum sparse but replica building interesting. Save yourself from climbing the stairs to next level where display is only about rich man who funded the building of the museum in 1929. But along the stairs is a wall mural of the missions founded by Serra which is worth looking at. Some good interactive exhibits for small children. Good views of city and ocean.,30,Presidio Park,October 2015
MarriedLady2014,Run down and smelly,"There was a broken sewer main in front of the mission and it obviously had been that way for a while. The smell was like an out house. The Presidio/Mission building was run down and didn't feel ""safe"" to us. It needs major improvements. We walked the top of the hill for the view and several palm trees etc were torn down and in a pile...don't know what that was about, but certainly was not visually appealing. ",10,Presidio Park,November 2015
Dan F,Fresh pine in the morning,"I ride my bike through this area and sometimes workout near the dog park fairly frequently. The neighborhood is very quaint and the park itself has a rich pine smell early in the morning around 6-7. The landmarks nearby aren't spectacular, but if you continue going south towards Ft.

GrellisSanPedro_CA,Underrated gem,"As one reviewer noted, this museum is a labor of love for its staff, and it packs quite a bit into Day Hall.  The first floor includes an exhibit about the history of the Mexican American War in California, and a multi-station review of the current boot camp experience at MCRD.  The upper floor is focused on Marine Corps history, shown mainly through the lens of units that were trained at MCRD.  Some of the highlights for me were the room full of small arms that were recovered from various battlefields, and the Iraq/Afghanistan gallery, which includes a piece of the Saddam Hussein statute that was pulled down in Baghdad.  There are also a number of exhibits commemorating Medal of Honor and Navy Cross awardees, and their citations never fail to inspire.  Outside of the museum, the courtyard includes a number of artillery and mortar pieces, both from the US and foreign countries, and you can watch recruits drill on the parade deck.",40,Marine Corps Command Museum,November 2014
MRTNs,Semper Fi!,Marine Corps history through different war eras as well as Marine Corps Recruit Training history. The different Galleries was very well put together and organized.

Hoyt S,Heart and Soul of La Jolla,"La Jolla is a special place, with its unique beaches, stunning vistas, restaurants, shops and art galleries. But to truly experience the heart and soul of this coastal town, you have to visit Ellen Browning Scripps Park. This relatively unchanged stretch of public park has remained the one constant over the years. Homes and buildings may rise and fall, and the sandstone does erode under the constant pounding of the surf, but there is something timeless about the sea and the sky - especially when experienced along the seawall, on a bench or in a belvedere  at this sanctuary of green grass and blue ocean.

TowpilotKen,Good city park,"This is the park that resides on the bluff overlooking Old Town.  It's easy to miss the entrance, since it's a innocuous T-intersection just north of Old Town.  However, if you want to learn about early San Diego, it should not be missed.  This is the site of the original Spanish military camps and fort, and the remains of the fort are still visible as mounts inside the park.  Years ago, archeologists dug this area up, then returned it to it's natural setting.  Park below the Serra Museum and walk around the park, there are many good signs documenting what it there.  Don't miss walking up the hill, there are several old monuments to military units important to San Diego, including the original Mormon Battallion that passed through San Diego in the late 19th century.  Sadly, the park suffers a bit from the City's financial problems, so it's not kept up as well as it should be, but it's still one of the best hidden gems of San Diego.  Rosecrans Ave., the street that you turn off from to get here, is also landmarked as California's oldest commerical street.",50,Presidio Park,November 2012

There are also many historic buildings in the park which are very educational about the history of the original San Diego townsite. Many special attractions occur here too on a regular basis (check locally). This is also the main hub for the Old Town Trolley Tours. While we did not ride the trolley this trip, we have done it before and highly recommend it. You learn a great deal about San Diego, and they cover a huge area of the city and Coronado, with the convenience of many hop on/hop off destinations and 15 minute intervals during the entire day.

Elizabeth D,"Yikes, should not have public access....bring an ice pick/crampons","Wow - If you have any qualms about sliding off a cliff, then bring crampons and an ice pick, or just skip this washed out mess entirely. On 1/14/17 our hike was a slippery, sliding, muddy mess, done on all fours. Good luck finding somewhere to walk upright without clinging to an eroding cliff! ""Narrow"" does not even begin to describe the trail. It is simply gone in some places. You are literally clinging to a wall of sand hoping your feet do not slip down the side of the canyon/whatever is below.... Honestly, I cannot believe the public is allowed to come here, unless the ""trail"" has dramatically changed recently. My plan was to just get to the beach and find some staircase back up that another hiker/slider had mentioned on our way down. Couldn't even get that far. I ended up crawling back up the stream, in the water, past the most washed out parts of the trail (very quickly, I might add, to avoid being hit by other hikers sliding off - ugh). Good luck ya'll and make sure you have a cell phone to call for emergency services. I was too freaked out to photograph the most dangerous parts of the trail. Maybe I was being a big baby, but it was one of those moments I couldn't believe was actually happening.... as in, this was NOT a good idea!! :(",20,Ho Chi Minh Trail,January 2017

kellithetaz,Hard to find but worth it for the pics,"Visited this area with co-workers the day after a hard rain. Since the trail is pretty steep in areas, it was fairly slick, however the view was pretty cool. It was like a mini slot canyon you would see in a place like Utah. The bottom portion of the trail is very steep and was quite muddy leading down to the beach area. Obviously, this area is a favorite path to the water for local. We were passed several times by barefoot surfers scampering down the steep paths to get some surfing in before dark.

The length of the paved trail around the reservoir is only 5 miles, but the named  arms and coves act like little switchbacks to change up the scenery enough with a little bit of tree cover here and there for shade to keep you from getting overheated and bored.

It's a great area to walk. Lake is surrounded by hills and some gorgeous houses sit atop the hills. The terrain is all paved but looks like you can go off the paved path to dirt trails as well. The parking is free as is access to Miramar Lake. There are mile markers and also several port a potties set up all around the lake. The entire thing is fairly flat with some incline but not too serious. We walked with a stroller. There were also people on bikes and roller blades. You can bring dogs there but they must stay on the leash and also away from the water. It's a great place to spend an afternoon.,40,Miramar Reservoir,April 2012
saintba,Great place to go biking/running/rollerblading,There were several people fishing at the Lake as well.   (Keep in mind I think you probably need a permit for this) but a very quiet and peaceful place.,50,Miramar Reservoir,September 2012
LizaKline,"Running, Biking & Fishing...AKA Miramar Lake","Great, peaceful, well maintained park for fishing, running, hiking and biking.  It's a 5 mile paved loop around the Lake.

10ringtraveler,Nice hiking trails.,"I had met a few friends for coffee nearby and decided to walk some of the trails inside this park. Most of the trails are soft sand and very comfortable to walk on. Parts of the trails take you to areas where there are numerous birds to watch. I saw egrets, ducks, falcons and a Great Blue Heron. Very pretty to see. I mostly stayed on the northern end of the park but there is also beach access from some of the trails. It is a nice place to visit.",40,Border Field State Park,December 2017
Tom S,Great place for dogs.,I lived in San Diego many years ago and always took my dogs to Fiesta Island for a swim.I now live in Arizona and make the trip back to San Diego often. I go to dog beach most of the time but it can be crowded and hard to find parking. Fiesta Island is easy to find parking easy access to the water. A little primitive but a fun place to go.,40,Fiesta Island,August 2016
cocoN1,What's not to love?!,"We have been in the Ocean Beach area several times for lunch or dinner and each time I see this pier I want to go out on it. This was the year! The views are incredible. One of the largest/longest piers I've ever been on. Some fishermen and women and of course those of us that just can't get enough of the ocean. It really is amazing to look at from that far out. There is a small cafe that sits on the pier about 1/2 way out. It looked nice, clean & the food smelled good. We'll stop there next time to eat. I would definitely make the walk again.",50,Ocean Beach Municipal Pier,July 2016
BigA1999,Was not amazed,"I didn't expect a lot and had better memories of it. In general it is mainly junk and the rest seems to be actually more expensive then in any shop in San Diego.

I was seated in the lower level and had a terrible view of the field. The vendors ran out of food and alcohol by halftime but told me to walk around the stadium to see if other vendors had what I was looking for, no thanks.

danieltI6875FE,Interesting Place To Visit,I found this a very intriguing place to visit and stand right by the fences bordering the US and Mexico.  It was an eye opener and a lot of families go here to interact with their familes on the Mexico side.  I highly recommend a visit down here.  It's only about 20 minutes from downtown San Diego.  The beach on the US side is dirty and virtually deserted while the the beach was roaring on the Tijuana side.  The water is to rough to swim in. There are clean bathroom facilities and a few picnic tables.  Quiet and secluded.,40,Border Field State Park,September 2016

Traveltilyoudrop_110,The State Park that's been forgotten!,"The road to the beach was closed (someone there said it had been closed for at least a year, not sure if this is accurate) so it was a long walk from where you could park (mapped it and it said 2 miles but I am not sure that is exactly accurate) but it was a very long, hot walk. It was very sad to see families walking with strollers, young children and elders on this dirty, unkept road to visit people on the other side of the border. One elder man made the walk with his cane and very crippled gait. The road and beach were dirty, there was trash, and obviously the area was not being cared for. How can a state park be so abandoned? It was a sad trip for me - I was there as a tourist, most were there to see someone on the other side of the border fence. Surely, we can at least open the road so that the people so desperate to see their loved ones on the other side of the border can access the area without such a long, hot walk! If you go, wear good supportive shoes and take water. I would not go alone either as its very isolated.",10,Border Field State Park,July 2015

Mojo928,Needs updating but fun experience ,"Came in town for the game to see the visiting team. The stadium could definitely use some updating (small screens & hard to hear officials). The biggest complaint was trying to get into the stadium...got in line 35 minutes before kickoff & still ended up missing most of the first quarter. Security was extremely slow & at gate A, there were 3 lines with only 1 door to actually get in, so it was a cluster.... Once we were in we had a good time...sat in section L19 and we were in the sun for first half, shade in second half. Looked like home team side was in the shade if you're looking for tickets for future games.",30,SDCCU Stadium,October 2016

Maybe not up to par with some of the newer domed stadiums but our seats were great despite being in the upper section; plenty of food and drink choices and friendly Charger fans.  Super easy to get to by taking the trolley and plenty of tailgating going on!  WARNING:  Do not bring glass onto the grounds.  Not only do they confiscate but they also issue tickets.    If you take the trolley, expect to use either stairs or ramps to enter / exit the trolley lines.",50,SDCCU Stadium,October 2016

worldtraveller2801,Peaceful state park on the border,"This park is located at the most southwestern corner of the continental U.S.  I've visited 3 times and the park has been closed to vehicles all times.  There is a parking lot just outside of the park entrance.  Park there, then walk about a mile and a half to view the border fence going into the ocean.  It's mostly flat with one small hill to climb to view the fence going into the ocean.  There are 2 options to walk there, follow the road or walk on the path straight out to the beach, then follow the beach to the border.  Both ways are a pleasant walk and I like to make a loop.  No swimming is allowed on the beach.  On the weekends, there is a border patrol officer at the fence.  They allow you walk up to the fence and view the Mexican side.  Families frequently come here to see and speak to their families on the Mexican side.  It's quite humbling and an interesting experience.  There are restrooms and picnic tables close to the fence.  There are a lot of birds at this park.  It would make a good bird watching location.  It's a nice park to go for a walk and enjoy the beautiful scenery along the beach.  It's usually quiet and not many people are around.  This is a good park to bring out of town visitors to.",40,Border Field State Park,April 2014

John M,Irish Rovers Concert,"Nice little theater which apparently was refurbished not too long ago.  Seats on the floor had ample room and were quite comfortable (Hear tell the ones in the balcony are rather jammed packed, so avoid those if you can).  Great concert, the Irish Rovers Fairwell tour.  The only reason I gave the venue a four and not a five was the beer selection or lack thereof:  Bud Light, Corona and Heineken (come on now, this is a micro brew mecca and I expected at least a couple of local selections).  FYI, contrary to other reviews on Yelp or on here, you can take your beverage back to your seat  (i.e. you don't have to down it in the lobby).",40,Balboa Theatre,January 2014

Once the house becomes intolerable, we head down.  Stay as late as we can before the kids get restless, hit Mission Beach for a burrito on the way home, and once we are home, slip into our pool to get rid of the feeling you have from wearing sunscreen and being at the beach",40,Fiesta Island,August 2013
Globe_TrekkerXXX,Excellent Guns N' Roses Event,"This stadium have plenty of parking space for music concert and It was a breeze going in and out of the parking lot. The parking fee is $20 in Qualcomm; much reasonable than in Rose Bowl which is $80 to park right next to the stadium and $40 in the city recreational park. I recommend the parking lot near by the main entrance less people and I noticed most people are parked near by the city trolley station. The concert merchandise store near by gate A had less people, while the second store on the other side had a long line to buy concert t-shirts. They do not allow big bags like backpack and the smaller bag/purse the better and no professional dslr camera is allowed and no selfie sticks allowed either. The stadium food was ok and expensive as usual nothing to get excited about; much better to bring your own food while you're waiting in your car by the parking lot not only you save money and you'll enjoy more the food of your choice.",40,SDCCU Stadium,August 2016

You can walk down to the beach, but it's at least 3 miles, which is not something I can easily do.  I think it really sucks that this park is not easily accessible for the public.

Chappedheel,"A surprising, exciting visit","A library isn't usually at the top of anyone's list, but this brand-new building is a showcase for the city -- and stands out from almost any high point in the city.  Right near Petco Field, it looks like a futuristic steel silhouette of some sort of cathedral, with a partial dome arching over everything.  Inside are commanding, breathtaking views not only inside - up and down within the building, but to the outside, of the Coronado bridge and much of the landscape.  Inside are a beautiful rock garden on the ?8th? floor, intriguing art gallery and rare book/rare stuff room, on the 9th floor (in addition to some great views), and treats like an area devoted to fans' photos of the Padres and stadium, a 3-D printer, and Chihuly sculptures visible only from inside the all-glass elevator.  Rewarding to see the books available to all as well as plenty of computer stations, and particularly exciting to note that the 6th and 7th floors are dedicated to a city-sponsored charter school.  Plenty of areas for meetings, and tours available.  Gift shop is fun!  Give it 1-2 hrs. and surprise yourself.

Mcaliente999,Beautiful Architecture,"If you love books and architecture this is your place. Since I moved back I have been spending a lot of time here. It's a quiet place to study and the faculty is fantastic. There is plenty of room for everyone (seat wise) because the library itself is huge. As most libraries are forced to allow the homeless, this one is different because there is a charter school between 6-7 floors so the homeless drunks and indigents are not allowed in unless they are actually conducting library business. I realize this sounds heartless, but until you have sat on a urine soaked chair to study, you have no idea what I'm talking about. ",50,San Diego Central Library,June 2014
Godizself,Library on a vacation?,"Yes, there are some great alternatives to museums and amusement parks. San Diego is one of those rare cities that provides free entertainment and enjoyment through their libraries. If your family wants a 2 hour activity, after breakfast and make sure the kids (ages 3-7) to a nap before another tourist rendezvous, then,voila the library is the alternative. Plus, most parents feel guilty that the children haven't read the 10 books packed in the luggage. Forego the guilt. The musicians were interactive (Hullaboo, Zydeco Band), the musician was hilarious (Kalamazoo) and all artists were kid friendly and parent funny. The children interacted, were educated, entertained and even spent an additional hour reading books in the library.  Best of all this entertainment was free. The best of tax dollars. Oh yes, we enjoyed all the traditional entertainment but a refresher to enjoy simple fun as well. Go to San Diego Public Library and click events.

We visited Balboa Park, the Gaslamp District, Seaport Village, Old Town, the harbor and even traveled to Chula Vista to visit the Living Coast Discovery Center. Sure, you may have to wait 10 or 15 minutes for a bus or a trolley, but it's worth it. Parking in San Diego can be a nightmare and expensive, so the wait is nothing. Besides, there is a very interesting cross-section of riders that make the trips very interesting! Don't worry, it is pretty safe. We had zero concerns over two full days of riding.",50,San Diego Metropolitan Transit System,April 2016
Bill W,San Diego Trolley To Tiajuana Mexico,"The trolley will take you to the pedestrian crossing at the Mexican border, where you can quickly clear Mexican customs.  Cabs and a shuttle are available on the Mexican side to take you to downtown (Revolution Boulevard) or any other part of TJ.  There was plenty of seating in both directions; no one had to stand on the Trolley.  If you're going to TJ (and I get that a lot of Americans no longer see it as a safe destination), the Trolley is quick, easy, cheap and reliable transportation.  Frankly, I wouldn't want to drive in Mexico.  The Trolley can solve that problem for you.",50,San Diego Metropolitan Transit System,April 2016
Tiffany Y,Needs a serious makeover,"I do like that you can catch the train from the station to wherever you need to go.  Being able to catch public transit is a huge plus in my book.  They could have made it a bit clearer how to purchase the ticket though.  Perhaps, they assume that everyone is from there and already knows how to do this.  I was in some line that wasn't the correct line and had to find the right line just to get a ticket.

8675309bergman,Nice time at Holiday Bowl,"We attended the 2015 Holiday Bowl this past week.  The stadium is easy to get to using the trolley.  We parked at Old Town and bought the day pass for $5 per person to take the trolley to the Holiday Bowl parade and then later in the day to the football game.  We arrived very early so we did not have the long line issues many people experienced arriving 30-60 minutes early.  We purchased tickets on the club level and the food options were definitely better on that level vs. the field level.  They also have nice lounges to warm up in on the club level.  We purchased the first row in section 34 which is a great section because that is entrance J right as you get off the trolley.  The first row however was not the best because although you have great leg room, the metal railing really blocks your view.  If I was to purchase again I would pick a few rows up in the club section.  The half-time show was fabulous!  The stadium overall needs some TLC but overall a good experience.",40,SDCCU Stadium,December 2015

Wis_Badger_Traveler,Take public transit. Get there early. Big lines to get in.,It's not the nicest stadium but it was fine. You should watch the game or event and forget about the lack of amenities. Signage was confusing and it was tricky getting to Club Seats. ,30,SDCCU Stadium,December 2015
men2za,Something Different,Just how everyone is saying its a lonely state park went there on a Saturday afternoon gate was open paid 5 dollars at the booth  for entry drive down the road for 1 mile takes you to the picnic area and restrooms. There's a area were you can walk up to the primary fence and see through the small holes and there's a BP officer at all times there in that specific section. The fence runs all the way to the beach pretty much like everyone that has been here on the U.S. side is lonely and empty and on the others side of the fence everybody is having a good time at the beach.,40,Border Field State Park,October 2014

Ron T,Good transit system,"We spent a week in San Diego and always used the transit system.

Pinehills2,A Pleasant Afternoon,"We took our 9 year old grandson to the Central Library. It is conveniently located and is a beautiful building. We are new to the area so required new library cards. The process was speedy and the staff was friendly. We spent most of our time in the children's area which was well stocked with books, games, videos, etc.  We did a quick tour of the other floors and were impressed with the facility. We highly recommend a visit.",50,San Diego Central Library,March 2015
SDDad,San Diego's Central Library Has Something For Everyone,"I've lived in San Diego for over thirty years.  Everyone knows about our world famous zoo, Balboa Park, beaches, Gaslamp District, and our quaint small beach communities.  Only recently did I visit our new downtown library and it needs to be added to the list of things to see in San Diego if you have an hour or two and are interested in something intellectually rewarding.  Seven of the nine stories are open to the public and each level has it's own attaction - from areas for young kids, to a teenager-only wing, a career center, and dozens of study rooms that can be reserved for small groups, and very pleasing architecture.  While some may think a physical library is an anachronism, I could see that well over a hundred people of all ages were there taking advantage of free computers connected to the internet or using their laptops while sitting looking at a view of the harbor.  It even has a publicly available 3-D printer.  My favorite area is on the top floor where there is a room devoted to old and rare books and a docent to point out the highlights of the collection.  There is a parking garage under the building that is free for the first two hours with validation at the library main desk.",50,San Diego Central Library,April 2015

Kim E,Wonderful Experience!!,"We took Amtrak to San Diego and used the transit system to see all the attractions.  First of all I ordered a Compass Card with a 4 day pass online, so we traveled everywhere for 4 days for only $17!  (includes $2 for the card itself)  You can purchase these cards at most trolley stations too.  Right from the Amtrak station we got on the trolley to a trolley station nearest our motel. The pass is good for buses too, so if the trolley does not get you where you want to go, you can transfer to a bus. San Diego is a beautiful place and SDMTS makes it easy to see the sites.",50,San Diego Metropolitan Transit System,August 2015

Brian S,Good for tourist to get around.,"Excellent system for getting you all over town.  Only $5.00 a day and you can go as many times as you please.  The trolley will take you to all the popular places like Gaslamp, Old town and Little Italy as well as the Seaside area.  If your hotel is anywhere along the trolley line I would recommend getting a ticket.  You can take the trolley and not have to worry about having too much to drink, traffic or parking.  ",50,San Diego Metropolitan Transit System,August 2015
TravelTechPenngrove,Can't say enough good things,"Being able to fly down and enjoy our vacation without getting into a car or taxi was most excellent.  We stayed a block away from the trolley and that provided access to almost anywhere we wanted to go.  To the ballgame every night, to the different districts.  Once we figured out the transit hub, buses and trolley's meant having a fantastic adventure on $5 a day. This transit system if one of the best I have ever used.  ",50,San Diego Metropolitan Transit System,July 2015
145aniad,Great option for tourists.,"My boyfriend and I decided to save money by using San Diego's local transit system instead of renting a car. This worked out well for us, as we picked a good hotel location. We used the trolley and the bus, both were fast and efficient to use. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because they do not offer transfers. It's $2.25 for one way, no matter how many stops. In Vancouver BC, we get transfers that are good for 1.5 hours to use however many times we like. I think the San Diego MTS would be a lot better if they had this transfer system as well.",40,San Diego Metropolitan Transit System,August 2015
Wesley C,Fans Deserve Better,"The game itself was fun and the fans enthusiastic.  They have a lot of fireworks to add to the excitement.

Jufrafay,Birthday football game ALMOST without the celebration!,"We visited the San Diego Chargers as my husband's birthday gift. Being from out of the country, this was quite an experience. We had researched and purchased high-end seating in the Club section, offering us in-seat meal and beverage service.Acess to a lounge prior to the game was very cool and there was also 2 former players available for photo ops and autographs. The seats were cushioned, extra wide and comfy. View was great. We ALMOST had a disastrous moment when I ordered 2 glasses of wine to toast my husband. With the NFL security crackdown, we were each only carrying a drivers license and our credit card. We are grandparents and look like ones, just to explain the context. The waitress who was servicing our section  informed us that she would not be able to serve us any alcohol because the Qualcomm Stadium has a policy to serve only Americans - people with American drivers' licences. WOW. What a ton of bricks. I am an American citizen, living in another country and who left her passport in her hotel safe because of the safety restrictions, was not allowed to carry her purse in (only small clutch which wouldn't fit my passport). After some discussion, she FINALLY accepted to serve us each one glass of wine, to toast my husband's 60th birthday. Maybe this policy chould/should be revisited? Other than that, a marvelous outing in a fine stadium.",40,SDCCU Stadium,October 2016
JohnnyOxnard,Normal Swap Meet,"Decided to stop in to walk around Kobey's Swap Meet while in San Diego.  The parking is free so just drive straight to the main entrance way.  Lots of cars are there but it seemed easy to find a space.  It only cost $2 each to get in.  The port-o-potty restrooms outside the gate are free but inside they cost you $1.  All of them are pretty smelly so try to go before go to the swap meet. Normal booths of people selling there stuff.  I did find some big brimmed hats for $5 each which I use for travel so a swap meet is the best place to buy them.  The same hats in Mexico cost $20.  leather wallets are also fairly cheap in these places.  If you know what you want, you can be in and out within an hour.",30,Kobey's Swap Meet,January 2013

grandslamhomer,""" Great Historic Theater to Watch Plays or Concerts ""","My wife and I have been to the Balboa Theater several times before, but last night we went to watch the ""Australian Bee Gees show"" which was a Multi Media Tribute Concert to the history of the Singing Icon group the Bee Gees. The vintage, quaint, and historic setting of the Balboa Theater made the concert show feel so realistic, everyone thought they were back in the 60's, 70's, and 80's as the Bee Gees went through there three decades of famous tunes. I have never seen people in there 60's, 70's and 80's so involved into a concert, ever !. The sell out crowd of people were standing ,dancing, clapping , and singing along with the entertainers on every song. It was one of the best concert shows I have ever seen. The entertainers not only sounded exactly like the original Bee Gees, but they looked incredibly the same. My wife and I had 2nd row center seats so we could see and hear everything so well. The seating in the Balboa Theater is very comfortable with nice leg room, and the parking at the NBC building across the street for $10 was convenient, clean, and the attendants were  very nice.",50,Balboa Theatre,March 2015

Even during this day of the week there was ample public parking available. This is the 2nd time we have watched this troupe at this venue. The theater harkens back to a bygone era with the ornate auditorium. The lobby is a little on the small side and can become very crowded prior to the event or during intermission. The concert was very enjoyable due the great acoustics afforded by the theater. The seating is very comfortable and with ample legroom.

It's well worth it, but if its a warm day be sure to bring some water. There were helicopters circling the field above, but as soon as we started to approach the wall on the beach they moved over. Three Border Patrol agents also drove and walked by us as we got closer. We were the only people on the beach. On the way back, an agent casually asked us if we made it all the way to the border being such a hot day.

ClassicTheatre,Day pass for $5 is great bargain,"We took several trolleys to go completely around San Diego and got a great overview of the city.  Pass allowed us to use any trolley or bus.  Trolleys and buses run frequently - and on time - and are very efficient.  Big windows, easy to use.  You can pay cash (exact change only) on the bus, but you must have a card for the trolley, which can then be used on bus as well.  You can buy cards at machines at Transit Centers - web site was a little misleading about location, but we finally got ours at metro stop at C and about 1st St.  City Center, or something like that.  Also at 12th and Imperial and I'm sure other major transfer points.  We were very impressed with the public transportation system in San Diego and used it almost exclusively.

At Fiesta, you can circumnavigate the island while your dog gets an even better workout racing into the surf and up and down the short cliff.

Lance P,Unexpected gem,"Although this is a small museum, the admission price is very cheap ($2 Jan/2014) and it has some very interesting exhibits. The main room is divided with on side displaying items from the old San Diego Chinatown, and local Chinese history and the other side showing artifacts from China. In back is very lovely and peaceful courtyard and garden. Across the street was an exhibit featuring a rotating exhibit. The docent we met was very friendly and helpful. The place is definitely worth a stop if you are in the Gaslamp district of San Diego, or by the New Children's Museum.",50,San Diego Chinese Historical Museum,January 2014
Tkyrnr,Great Staff,Staff is awesome and very helpful. Anyone interested in learning more about Asian in California should definitely visit.,40,San Diego Chinese Historical Museum,August 2014
Wanderpair,Intreguing Corner of San Diego history,This small history museum covers a lot of ground in a small space.  This forgotten portion of race relations in early California history is well documented here.  From the gold miners through the first Chinese laundries to the restaurant culture- it spans a great deal of information.  Most of which may not be known to the non-Asian populations.  The docents are informative and extremely knowledgeable; probably because the majority have first hand knowledge of what it means to be of Asian descent in San Diego.  A memorable time spent here.  Easy access via trolley or walking in the Gaslight District.,40,San Diego Chinese Historical Museum,January 2015
eabat17,Amazing!,"My wife and I have traveled around the country and have visited many State and National parks within the U.S. While this park could use some TLC, it is by far our favorite. We went on a chilly day and walked along the beach. This park is simple, but extremely beautiful and unique! We have traveled around the globe and have visited many beaches as well, but this one takes the award for our favorite. Seeing Mexico on one side of the border fence and watching the waves crash on this amazing beach made for one of the most peaceful afternoons we have experienced in a long time. A must see for anyone visiting San Diego! We hope to be back many times! ",50,Border Field State Park,January 2017
SantiagoChago,By the border with friends,"An easy hike to enjoy with friends. The place is free for walkers and $5 if you like to drive in. Many flowers and land bird attractions. The trail takes you by the beach where the border fence ends. There is a square area with benches and tables to rest. Although is not well taken care off you do not stop of enjoying the scenic view of the ocean and the Imperial Beach wet lands. Not to forget that you will view first hand the Mexico border. You will also see many border patrol officers guarding the area. There is place, opened only on the weekends, called the monument neutral area which allows both the Mexican and US citizens see each other crossing the border without passport in a temporary nature. Do not come if is raining as flooding will not allow to enjoy the full experience. This is a really must see experience.",40,Border Field State Park,April 2017
GlobalGypsy_13,Nature Unpacked,"Since cars are no longer allowed into this park (only Border Patrol vehicles), entrance is free. The mile walk from the small parking area with entry sign to the beach includes vistas of Tijuana, birds, flowering succulents, a salt marsh area, lizards, and solitude.  Occasionally you'll share the wide trail to the beach with horses and a few hikers. Most of the fenced off dune area is a breeding ground for Snowy Plovers and the Least Tern; so be mindful, but do enjoy your walk in nature unbound.",40,Border Field State Park,June 2017
abz f,Just wanted to see the border,"Found this walk very interesting. Parked the car in the car park and walked for 15 minutes down to the beach. Great beach and an amazing view. Then we walked another 15 to 20 mins to the border, Found it very strange that on the other side of the fence is a different country. The Mexican side was really busy but we were the only ones on the American side. You can only get to within 30 metres of the fence as the border patrol don't like you going right up to it. Just a reminder take bottled water with you.",30,Border Field State Park,April 2017

Suzanne92107,San Diego has a library worth touring,"This is a library worth visiting, not only for its wonderful book and magazine collection, but also for its striking architecture (the dome is larger than the US Capitol's dome), community outreach (a health and wellness desk), and special collections (e.g., the baseball book and memorabilia collection on the 8th floor). Opened in December 2013, the Library is a cornerstone of the vibrant East Village neighborhood, and just a couple of blocks from the Padres baseball park.  It's worth taking a tour with one of the volunteers (check out the Library's website for details) - lots of nooks and crannies, and interesting tidbits. There is a charter high school occupying two floors of the 9-story building. There are also over 300 computers available for free, and they can be reserved. This is a library that is a vital part of the community and truly serves the public.  Makes me proud to be a San Diegan.  Tips:  The building has underground parking, and the first two hours are free with validation available inside the library. The library has a couple of eating spots (one in the outdoor courtyard by the front entrance, and one inside the building), and a gift shop - so, go have lunch and take a tour!",50,San Diego Central Library,June 2016

Added to that, the librarians are spectacular and engaged and fun ... wow, how wonderful it would be to call this branch your home library.

gtrtravel,Great economical way to get around,"Based on other positive Trip Advisor reviews, we decided to use the MTS ""Trolley"" to get around San Diego one day. As I read the reviews and scoured the line maps, I was surprised I didn't see service connecting with the airport. When we arrived at the airport, I checked in at the Information Desk and asked a few more questions before purchasing the MTS cards from the machine. When I mentioned the lack of connection to the airport, ONE person at the desk was able to say Yes, there IS a way! There is a free, blue, remote parking shuttle bus that picks up in the shuttle lane that says ""Terminal to Trolley"" on the bus. It will take you to a drop off point that is a very reasonable 2 block walk to the closest Trolley station. Voila!! We could have taken any other form of airport transfer to our hotel, but this was the thrill of the hunt to utilize the Trolley & sightsee along the way. Plus, we had intended to use the Trolley to come back downtown later in the day to take a Harbor Cruise (which I highly recommend and will also write a review later). So armed with the info from that ONE Information Desk employee, we were able to purchase an all day, single day ride pass at only $5 each (plus $2 card fee each - that can reloaded and reused) and have airport transportation to our hotel plus round trip downtown passage for only a total of $14 for 2 of us. Quite the bargain I feel, plus I like to ride like a local when visiting any city when I've been advised that it's safe. Great job Trip Advisor network of reviewers!!

It's incredible when you have the place to yourself and you can enjoy the breathtaking views of the beach scene, the darkness at night down the coast to the south, and the stars overhead. Especially when the surf is high. When it's great, it's transcendent. But it's a place you don't need to deal with when it's full of fishermen and you have to worry about getting a hook caught in your ear when someone casts overheard (against the rules). If the best-case scenario sounds good to you, take your chances.",40,Ocean Beach Municipal Pier,August 2016
jagfan73,Just as I remembered It.,"Were here 40 years ago. Went to school at the old Naval Training Center. Pier is showing signs of aging. But it is still beautiful. Goes way out into the ocean. Plenty of room to fish or sit. The views are incredible. North has the surfers. South looking towards Sunset Cliffs. I remember when Jacksonville Fl. built the new pier in Jacksonville Beach. The length was shortened for budgetary reasons. I thought of this pier. If your going to build it do it right. They really missed a golden opportunity. It would have paid for itself. I traveled 3,000 and put this on my list as places to see in San Diego. I don't think anyone from California travels to Jacksonville to see that pier.",50,Ocean Beach Municipal Pier,August 2016

The new garage charges $10.00 flat rate (cash) for the evening (candy mint given out by man at entry), is staffed after the concert, and has good lighting; the only drawback is that the spaces are small, but the location and price makes it attractive as parking downtown is scarce.

Once you enter through the fenced area, the remainder of the beach is fenced off from traffic, so you don't have to worry about your dog running off. The fenced area is huge, it takes me between 20-30 minutes to jog all the way around it. If walking, it takes a good 45 minutes to an hour, but it is completely flat, so it's really easy. The dogs love it here because there is so much room to run, that there is usually no aggressive behavior. Best dog park ever.",50,Fiesta Island,September 2016

40nancym,A nice walk,We visited here when the park was closed to traffic but open to pedestrians. We tried to walk to the border on the road but there was a big mud puddle in the road and we didn’t want to get our feet wet. We got the irony that people go through much hardships to cross into the US and here we were unwilling to get our feet alittle wet to get to the border. We walked to the beach but the sand was too hard to walk to and I had already hit my step goal for the day. We got some pictures of the border from afar but that’s as close as we got. ,30,Border Field State Park,January 2018
Ryan S,Long walk for nothing,Apparently you used to be able to drive right up to the beach and therefore quite close to the park. Now it's over a mile walk JUST to the beach and another 1/4 or half mile to the border park. Add in swamp flooded areas and we chose to turn around half way into the walk. Not much to see as far as I could tell.,20,Border Field State Park,January 2018
Maikokw,Interesting perspective,"2 adults, 2 teens - the walk was pleasant. Had rains earlier, which means that the water is contaminated by sewage - so shoes you can get dirty and jump around in are essential. Walk up towards the bluff near the ocean - towards the bullfighting ring - to a picnic area with tables, bbq pits, very clean bathrooms. And then ponder the difference inactivity on our side of the wall with the other side of the wall. Gotta say, it was interesting, contemplative and made me think. The walk back - along the beach, then inland - was pleasant. Saw rabbit, hawks, but no rattlesnakes. Easy to find paths, easy walk.

Our favorite, which is a big hit with our teenage grandson is the Grilled Steak Tacos.  The portions are not small and the steak sliced perfectly.  What kept me making this an excellent place is because the company running this restaurant inside the park has chosen to include a ""surcharge"" of 3 percent on the bill.  This is due to the fact the city has raised the minimum wage.  So, not only do you get an increase in the price, but an added charge.  ",40,El Prado,December 2017

Also, there are many homeless people camping out nearby and hanging out around it, so exercise  due caution.

Busylady21,Best Fish Tacos ever,"I had the opportunity to visit the stadium during a rain delay.  The employees remained upbeat and assured us the game would be played.  They were right.  I was at a group function on one of the party decks, we were served Mexican food, tacos, beans, rice..   Fish was available freshly cooked on a plank for our tacos.  When that was the meat you choose the employees just sectioned off a piece from the plank and placed it in the shell.  Topped with your choice of toppings it was the best fish taco I'd ever had.  I never would have thought the ballpark was the place to get it.",50,SDCCU Stadium,September 2016

Staff helpful but it took us 3 hours to get out of the stadium because they closed some car exists and only left one open.

David M,"So long San Diego ""Super Chargers""","San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, I am certainly glad my daughter and I were able to attend some of the NFL's San Diego Chargers football games there before the ""Bolts bolt for greener dollars in LA"" moved to LA over some controversial local politically posturing over money and a new stadium. Qualcomm has been rated as #32 out of 32 and last in the league. But my experience attending NFL games and concerts is that Qualcomm is easy to get to and in and out, parking using their grass fields is adequate leaving a short walk into the stadium but the very best part is that it is outdoors in San Diego where it is always nice and beautiful. Qualcomm will continue to host events even though the Chargers moved up the road and I would encourage any of you to attend. ",20,SDCCU Stadium,November 2016
AlexLee-SD,"A bit beat-up and going to exit the stage soon, and will remain in the hearts of the Chargers fans.","The current state and the future of Qualcomm Stadium have been the focus of many discussions and argumentations, and have appeared on many, many voting ballots. As Chargers moving out, this stadium is definitely retreating the stage. Not sure what is waiting for this once glorious stadium during the prime years of the Chargers. But no matter what will happens, the San Diego Chargers fans will always remember it in their hearts.",30,SDCCU Stadium,October 2016

It is open Friday with $1 admission and free to handicapped folks.  Saturday and Sunday are busier and $2 admission.  Not all commercial vendors...thank goodness, so you can feel like you have attended several garage sales. Did get some good second hand bargains and some new things that were priced lower than the store as well.  Only one food vendor and good free parking.  ",40,Kobey's Swap Meet,August 2016
mynahbird1,a must visit pier if you're new to San Diego,"I'm sharing about a place that I love to visit. The OB Pier is a unique pier, located in Ocean Beach.  Ocean Beach is a small hippie town with lots of character.  You can watch surfers catch waves, people fishing, homeless people, painting artist, hippies, etc.  You get what I'm trying to say.  It's a great people watching place! There's a cafe on the pier that sells food, bait & tackle place to get your fishing gear and restrooms. Below the pier offers a whole other world...walking to tide pools during low tide is fun, walking on the beach looking for shells. The entire area is post card photogenic.  A place for all ages.  And during any season.  FREE activity to enjoy!",50,Ocean Beach Municipal Pier,January 2017

samadeuus,The only place in OB that I like,"This pier is fun and adventurous. Whether you walk out along the actual pier itself or go walking along the south of it to some of the little hidden areas of cliffs and beach over there, it is a really fun experience. You want to be careful if you're walking along those rocks and hidden beaches however because it's super wet and slippery over there.",40,Ocean Beach Municipal Pier,January 2017

We parked at least four blocks away. There are lots of little shops and restaurants on the street and people selling things on the beach and pier. The pier goes at least a quarter of a mile into the water. The waves were nice to look at and I probably could have sat there for a while enjoying the wind, sun and waves. Some people were fishing off of the pier. I’m not sure of that was legal or not. There are some tide pools on the opposite of the pier from the beach.",40,Ocean Beach Municipal Pier,April 2017
maryaling,Beautiful building,Such a FUN night. ,50,Balboa Theatre,February 2018
bballwey,Great venue ,"My husband and I saw Beth Hart here and loved the venue. It reminded me of a mini Civic Theatre. One suggestion, I would get as close as you can to the stage because even though Beth was loud, the acoustics didn't carry well to the upper section. It was hard to hear the details in her songs but still worth it.",40,Balboa Theatre,February 2018
heatherj2772,Great smaller venue; great acoustics,"My family and I saw Stomp here and it was fantastic.  Our seats were in the balcony so I was a bit afraid our view wouldn't be good, but it was fantastic, and the acoustics were phenomenal.  It seems much smaller than the Civic Center (differently shaped -- more narrow).  The venue itself is decorated beautifully -- it definitely has that 1920's elaborate feel, but everything seems new thanks to the renovation and upkeep.  The rows are closer together than more modern venues, so there isn't much extra leg room, but the seats were comfortable so it was fine.  Even the exterior architecture is cool.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy tickets to another show here in the future.",50,Balboa Theatre,March 2018
grandslamhomer,""" Absolutely Fabulous ""","We went to the Balboa Theatre to see and hear the "" Ten Tenors "" from down under. The show started started with the song "" We are the Champions "" and that was exactly correct. The Ten Tenors have such great harmony and are so together as their presented there beautiful concert to the San Diego audience. The music consisted of a top of the line piano player, guitar player, and drummer who played all kinds of different sounds. The Ten Tenors were well worth the money, and I would definitely go to see them again. Great Show !",50,Balboa Theatre,March 2018

bigbadbuyer,Wonderful day beach,"This is a great place for a family with small children and/or dogs to enjoy a day at the beach. I would like to see more of a police patrol.

Variegated and also some grafting of other color rose's. We also viewed the cactus garden adjacent.  Just a word of caution for families with children; we saw two vagrants in the cactus garden. One defecating and one urinating on a tree, after he threw his trash in a bush. Then a guy taking rose clippings. This venue needs to be patrolled or at least CCTV to monitor.",50,Inez Grant Parker Memorial Rose Garden,June 2017

667jennm,A Quick Visit on the Last Day,"Somehow, when I googled the address of this Chinese Museum, I went to the wrong address earlier on the trip.  My buddy walked past the right address (the other must have been a meeting place) and there are 2 buildings.  (The main exhibits and the Ink displays across the street).  The volunteers were just starting their shift and did their best to ensure for the $5 admission fees would allow us to tour both buildings in a short time.  It’s not a huge museum but certainly remnants or photos or displays depicting the earlier history of how the Chinese settled in Chinatown.  We exchanged cultural stories of our own cities and it was great to see how the old pioneers migrated to start a new life in the lands of gold!

Examples include Tai Chi in the garden classes (free) on Saturday mornings at 9 a.m., school programs and public lectures, such as Sheldon Lou's riveting personal description of Peking in the 1950s and 1970s.  There's a small gift shop, but no food on the premises except for lectures and gallery openings when snacks are served.  Street parking is metered.

You can see part of the ""wall"" built to keep people from crossing over.  There is a ""friendship garden"" with a lighthouse on the Mexican side that US people can access between 10-2:00 and there is a number to call.  I do not have the number to include.  The most southwest point is noted with a small sign on the mesa near the border.  The beach is lovely.  ",40,Border Field State Park,January 2019
Ryan S,Saw some fence climbers!,Well the wall kinda sucked to get to the far southern most tip but it was worth it! Seriously though its 1.8 miles each direction from parking. And border patrol is constantly there just hoping someone tries something I guess. It was funny seeing people climb the other side of the wall...they were obviously horsing around and not actually attempting to circumvent the fence. It's a nice park...I suppose it's what San Diego would look like untouched. ,30,Border Field State Park,April 2019

Because we had to wait initially for the rain to subside the customers to be seated outside were given complimentary champagne.  Our server was especially cheerful and helpful.  There was a set menu with choices for salad, entree and dessert.  My husband had prime rib and said it was the best he ever had.  My friend and I each had the turkey and it was tender and delicious.  The food was excellent.  It was a perfect meal in a beautiful setting.",50,El Prado,December 2018

Thomas P,Urban architecture holds books and school,"The new San Diego library is one of three on west coast with a dramatic urban architecture. Other are in San Fran and Seattle. Mainly steel, concrete with wood accents, this 9 story building fits both the urban environment and its library purpose. Two floors are wholly dedicated to a charter high school.

There's also a small outdoor café near the Neil Morgan Auditorium.",50,San Diego Central Library,October 2017
miramirasol,Book aficionados dream ,"Gorgeous architecture and I would love to have this library as my 2nd home. This library is modern and simple, I love that there is art everywhere. If you go in the main elevator (the middle) there’s art showcased through a see through wall as you take an elevator ride up. We went up to the 9th floor and loved that there is event space to play, you can rent it out or hang out during the day in the chairs that are provided, granted they are a little stiff and uncomfortable not lounge type but the view and the fresh air is worth it. They also have a gallery on the 9th floor and a section called “rare books” for the book aficionados. Loved, loved the vibe of this library and appreciate the labor of love and mindfulness that went into building this community space out. Now beware, there are some homeless people that do roam inside the building or take a nap, they do have lovely desk that can serve as a nap zone.. so goes the theory build it and they will come. They also have a curated bookstore to shop at downstairs with unique gifts and modern chic accessories that are just to cute not to buy! ",50,San Diego Central Library,December 2017
lmpwm,Beautiful library compromised with homeless,"Well worth a visit, however, expect homeless & SA people outside and in the library itself with security present. 9th floor art exhibit was excellent.

It's a nice place for a leisurely stroll and a nice place to sit in the shade and relax after all the walking we did at the zoo. I recommend it if you have some time to kill or are just looking for a place to unwind. There is this really cool cactus there, unlike any other I've seen. It's huge and all twisty and curvy. Its a cool specimen where you'll be able to capture some unique photos.",30,Inez Grant Parker Memorial Rose Garden,June 2013

Anyway , park at North Beach Torre Pines. Parking along Hwy101 ocean is free but tricky later in day or weekends. Walk up the road and maps are in a box along the trail. This razor point trail is awesome but all of them up tere are great vista views and not too long. Only challenge is humping up the road to get on the top.

Justin G,Nice and Easy Trail with a Good Payoff,"A nice and easy out and back trail in Torrey Pines State Reserve.    The whole hike takes about an hour, and leads out to some amazing cliffs overlooking the pacific with some incredible erosion patterns carved into the sandstone.  The trail was very uncrowded prior to 10 AM, but as we were exiting the trail around 11 AM, there were quite a few people just starting the trail.

Yes, you may like it if you like dull, paved road of 5 miles. Or if your idea of “close to nature” includes bikers, barking dogs, screaming kids, few birds (teal mostly), many signs warning about rattlesnakes or regulations,  and the occasional Portable John.

During our vacation we try to find places ""the locals"" might frequent, and this swap meet had such high ratings it became almost an obsession for us. Unfortunately, we went on a Friday, one of the days they are scheduled to be open. There were only a handful of vendors, and we were told it was pretty much over by 11 on Fridays only.

I always find a wide range of reasonably priced items that jump off the tables and scream take-me-home.  This trip I lucked into bed sheets and fountain pens.  If you are a shopper this is a very pleasant way to spend 1-2 hours walking in the sunshine (when it does not rain mid visit).  there are coupons in the local tourist books to get a discount on the entry fee.

Some surfers, some fishermen, some sea gulls, we did not see any interesting birds, no pelicans, no egrets. Pipe blowers and several street performers, united by one characteristic: lack of talent.

Then find seating at one of their outdoor patios (hint:  there is a patio across the promenade from them that is literally over the beach and directly on the ocean!).  They'll find you with your food.  Just sit back and enjoy.  Be aware there are sparrows and, of course, seagulls that are very clever beggars - even though you aren't supposed to feed them - some of my breakfast ""accidentally"" falls over the glass wall that separates me from the beach and onto the ground below.

Then walked over to the extension across the street where the current Dragon Exhibit is held. Check out a Dragon birthday calendar but found I was not a dragon, other wise I get a dragon necklace. It is so great they have a selfie corner so you can take photo with big dragon on display and wear fancy dragon outfits and fancy empress hat.

LK G,Pleasant Surprise,"I just recently heard fo the Border Field State Park and was surprised to find the open area surrounded with horse stables. A little bit of country in the big city. We went over Labor Day Weekend. When every beach north of there was wall to wall of people, we shared the beach with one surfer and handful of others. This area is a treasure of wildlife, plant life, bird watching and an open spaces.  Several great hiking trails. There is a narrow road that brings you up to the beach and end of the wall, that in rainy season can get flooded, in which case you would need to hike about 1 mile.  The Friendship Circle which allows to talk with people on the other side of the wall is only open at certain times. Put the political issues aside and enjoy what the park has to offer. ",40,Border Field State Park,September 2019
molinda1,Very interesting especially because of all the current news and politics regarding the wall.,"We visited the state park Sunday, 10-27-19 and I found it extremely interesting.  It was not crowded which made it even more pleasant.  Quite a few of the reviews mentioned the beautiful beach but I found it anything but beautiful.  It was rather cool and windy and I did not see anyone on the beach at either side.  There was a seven dollar fee at the gate even tho other reviews mentioned only $5.   The border guards very friendly answering my many questions.  Even tho I do not have friends or family on the other side of the wall I was still able to enter the gated area where people can visit with family/friends on the other side of the wall.  There was a huge stadium on the other side of the wall which I was told was used for bull fighting but now is used for concerts.   What I found interesting is there is nothing mentioned in the travel brochures, etc about the wall.  I came across the information by mistake and am so glad I did.  I can't help but get the impression that the state park is not being mentioned intentionally because the liberals do not support the border wall.  I would recommend seeing the wall.",50,Border Field State Park,October 2019

northcedar,Witnessed an apprehension,"The ""park"" is just a dilapidated few buildings, parking lot and paths through the scrub.  My brother and I joked   about the remote possibility of seeing anyone sneaking across what with  5 military helicopters flying/training overhead at 2pm as we walked the mile and a half to see where the fence reaches into the ocean.  We chatted with the last of the other sightseers returning from the fence and were only about 200 yards from it when two young guys popped up out of nowhere.    Just as suddenly came a Border Patrol vehicle whipping up. The two guys started to bolt as the border agents yelled at them, they stopped and had a brief standoff, and then relented and all involved piled into the vehicle and drove off.  What timing, what a sight to see.  An apprehension right before our very eyes. There were plenty of people milling around on the other side of the fence but these two really did reach, ""The Promised Land"" for better or for worse.

Steak tacos without guacamole or cheese but an abundance of red cabbage?!!!  No enchiladas will be found on this menu, or any other inventive Mexican entrees. The menu is now touted as ""California Cuisine.""  This means it is similar to other Cohn menus and does not have an individual personality or unique and appealing offerings.

A brisk walk took about an hour and a half to cover the entire distant. Just about every point along the lake was scenic. There were distance markers every 1/4 mile so we knew how far we hiked. There were also portable toilets strategically placed along the way.  Vehicles were allowed but were limited to 10 mph. Great place to cycle, jog, hike or stroll. There were also places along the lake near the entrance where families can picnic.  The parking lot at the entrance seem to be quite a lot of parking spaces.

It's a nice area to walk around and take pictures.,40,Tuna Harbor Park,June 2019

indymama1,Walking tour of Gaslight District,"We just finished the 90-minute Saturday morning walking tour of the Gaslight District with John (aka “Alonzo Horton”) as our very knowledgeable guide.  We got a brief overview of the founding of San Diego, mainly driven by the real Mr. Horton in the mid-1800s.  It was in many ways an architectural tour, with lovely old Victorian buildings pointed out that once housed banks, hardware stores, theaters, brothels, and saloons, but now feature taco houses, sushi bars and craft beer halls.  The tour was peppered with interesting stories about San Diego characters of the past.  Great if you are interested in history and architecture.  Probably not so good for kids.",50,Gaslamp Museum at the Davis-Horton House,October 2017

If you like power walking, cycling or roller skating this is the place to do so. It's easy to find cafés and beach bars along the way, like to popular Woody's. What I found the most interesting is to watch people when walking along the promenade. Being here to visit my friend, this was a good way for me to explore the beach and SD daytime when she was working. I'm also a big fan of the beach! On the beach there's always something going on, so much to watch. On weekends the promenade gets pretty crowded, so if you don't like it busy, come on a weekday. This would also be a good couple activity to go ride bikes along the promenade, or to go with a friend.",40,The Promenade at Pacific Beach,October 2018

Tonya C,Great View from the Top,"The California Tower is located in the Museum of Man at Balboa Park.  This was one of the sites I really wanted to see on my first trip to San Diego.  It costs about $10 and it’s a guided tour and I think they only allow a couple of people up at a time.  For those who have some fears about having to climb a bunch of stairs, I think this is doable for most who have minor limitations.  I’m thinking about my aunt who has bad knees and my mom who is nervous about having to climb a bunch of stairs.  The good thing about this is that you stop at each landing and listen to the tour guides so it’s not like you are climbing all the way to the top in one sitting.  Unfortunately, there is no elevator so those with very limited mobility would not be able to do this.  The stairs are a little narrow but the guides are very patient so no one is rushing you up or down the stairs.  While the inside of the tower was nothing spectacular, the view from the top makes for some good photos.",40,California Tower,June 2018

TravelFan48105,Fabulous view!,"While researching sites to visit in Balboa Park, I discovered that the California Tower had opened to the public a few weeks previously.  Although the tour was a little pricey ($22.50) I decided to visit and was not disappointed.  Our excellent guide explained that the tower was built for the Panama-California Exposition in 1914 and had been closed for some 80 years, but opened in January 2015 following a three year restoration. We climbed the 125 steps (with a rest stop and commentary from the guide at each floor along the way, so the climb is pretty easy).  On reaching the top there is a fantastic 360 degree view of San Diego.  I was lucky to go on a perfectly clear day and was able to see many Balboa Park and San Diego landmarks.  Note that only about 14 people tour per time slot, so you should make an online booking ahead  of your visit.",50,California Tower,February 2015
PebblesCalifornia,Great Tower,last weekend we went to Balboa Park and had the opportunity to see the California tower. We took some lovely pictures and reviewed a lot of history on it. The touristy part from the Museum of Man. Unfortunately by the time we got down there the tours were booked. They told us that you could register for the tours online which we plan on doing when we return to Balboa Park with our annual season pass that we purchased for our family.,50,California Tower,March 2015
Patty L,Best view of San Diego,"When visiting San Diego this tower is a must see. The tour guides will fill you in on the extensive history of this beautiful structure. The views from the top are breathtaking which is a vast understatement. To my knowledge this is the only place in SD to see the entire city from all angles. Be prepared to make quite a climb. The guides stop along the way to narrate interesting facts about the tower and history of all around the area, so it makes it easy and enjoyable.",50,California Tower,April 2015
Travelair36,Stroll along the Waterfront,"Take a stroll along the harbor waterfront and get a feel for the nautical history and significance of what San Diego represents as a port city.  From tourist attractions, restaurants, shops and trolley stops, the waterfront is a central starting point for any visit to San Diego.  Located here you will see the Maritime Museum, Fish Groto, Bay Cruise Tours, The USS Midway, and continues down to Seaport Village with shops and restaurants.  One of the main stops on the Old Town Trolley, here you can jump on and off to seek out other locale area attractions.  Beyond the attractions, you have the scenic view across the bay to Coronado Island with its massive naval base.  I happen to catch sight of two V-22 Osprey tilt rotors as they made an approach into the naval base. Take your time and do some people watching as you meander slowly along the walkway taking in the sights and sounds of being down on the waterfront.",30,Waterfront Walkway,June 2014

Chris S,Excellent museum,"I enjoyed my time at the San Diego County Sheriff's Museum.  The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, and all of the exhibits were fantastic.  If you want to check out police cars, firearms, photos and displays of law enforcement you must come and check this gem of a museum out. Also, you get to try out the handcuffs, gun belt, take a photo of you behind bars or a mug shot, and even hop on the police motorbike.  Loved it.  Even though it's free, please donate to keep it up and running.",50,Sheriff's Museum,October 2014
Basiluzzo,Tap room is a cut above,"I took a group of co-workers here after a team-building event and it was the perfect spot. It's in a convenient location in this part of town (note the road has been named to AleSmith Court). The indoor and outdoor areas are both large and comfortable, full of light and air. The bar is loooong and the service really helpful. The selection was great and on a late afternoon the vibe was laid back and not noisy. One note - there's no food other than whatever food truck is there that day. Be sure to pick up a .394 Ale pint glass in the store - very cool!",50,AleSmith Brewing Company,June 2016
johnlong3711,Great Beers,"I didn't get to spend too much time here but the time I did, it was great.

I wish I could say more but next time I'm in the area, I'm going to spend more time here.",50,AleSmith Brewing Company,July 2016
Kendu24,Alesmith..... Nice!!,"My friend and I visited on our brewery tour. It was on my must go list, and it didn't disappoint. Craft beers are great! 4th brewery of the day, but they have a distinct flavor. Relaxed and literally open door sitting area. Tony Gwynn food truck, cornhole game readily available. Can't wait to see the the TG museum that they are building! True taste of SD. Cheers!",50,AleSmith Brewing Company,August 2016

33KJ,Best brewery in SD,I was in SD for a long weekend and hit about a half dozen breweries of all sizes.  This was my favorite.  Food truck out front and amazing beer.  Located near some others as well so easy to brewery hop as well.  The coffee stouts were ridiculous and the double IPA (and the other IPAs) were top notch.  Really cool facility.  Crazy what they can do with a warehouse in an industrial park!,50,AleSmith Brewing Company,August 2016
EWhitmore,Nice beach,"The sand was clean with very little seaweed.  If you want to surf or boogie board, it's a great place to do that (especially for beginners like my son).  There is beach parking however it fills up pretty quickly so get there early.  There is a small fee to park.  Has restroom facilities and a shower to wash off before getting back in your car.",40,South Carlsbad State Beach,August 2014
TheChad6266,Nice but needs work,"I have been coming to this beach for over 30yrs off and on. We have come the last 2 yrs., still great views and bathrooms are good. But some of the sights need work. Our fire pit is barley holding on. They only have a few working stairwells to the beach so depending on where your site is you might have a long walk. The park needs to invest their money and start rebuilding their stairwells they have closed off to make it easier for those you have problems walking. The park staff has done a better job this year being visible and making people turn their generators off when needed so you can hear the ocean. So over all still a very nice place just needs to be updated and it would be perfect. ",40,South Carlsbad State Beach,July 2014
Miknet,Fun discovery!,"Happened upon this museum while visiting old town with friends.  The San Diego Sheriff's Dept. had the foresight to save everything!!! It was really fun to visit, and the museum facilitated spirited talks and reminiscence with our friends.  Free with donations accepted.  Highly recommend a stop here.",50,Sheriff's Museum,May 2013
Jsaxm,Nice Station,"Just be aware, you need to line up early because that's just how people do it down here, they get in line way before the train even gets to the station. So, if you are traveling with a family, like we were in the business class car, then just go an stand in line early to make sure you get on the train first and can have first pick at the seats.",40,Santa Fe Depot,June 2016

FLworldwanderer,"Cars, motorcycles, and memorabilia .... Nice!","Nice collection of cars, trucks, motorcycles, specialty vehicles, and more.

psteelerfan77,Average Automotive Museum,I consider this attraction average at best. If you like obscure older vehicles that most people have never heard of and old motorcycles you will probably like it. The good news is it's $9 and you could look at everything close and still get done is less then an hour.  The bad news is that it smaller and didn't have anything great in my opinion.,30,San Diego Automotive Museum,June 2017
Howdidodi,Don't miss it,We got the trolley bus tour as we had limited time in San Diego . We got off in Balboa Park and saw this museum by chance. We were a little unsure whether to bother going in or not. I like my cars so we headed in. They had a collection of Japanese cars some of which were never sold in the US. They have a Delorean however the highlight was a car converted by Louis Mattar. Look it up but it's well worth going into the museum just to see this fab car.,40,San Diego Automotive Museum,June 2017

voyagerSussex,The setting is everything,"We stayed for one night on the rv park and loved the location with easy access to a beautiful beach watching pelicans and whales. The welcome was pleasant and helpful but the one negative was that Reserve America's paperwork hinted at but did not emphasise a major problem with electricity on this site, hence we had to use our generator. This one niggle apart the site was clean and well organised",40,South Carlsbad State Beach,February 2014

trippy l,Awesome Brew,"This place is awesome.  Food trucks in the back on weekends.  The brew is fantastic.  The servers are so enthusiastic about what they are serving.  Dogs are permitted (I think) although the tasting room is really small so I wouldn't bring any dog that even is remotely aggressive or stressed around crowds.  Weekends in particular can get where you are 2-3 deep to belly up.  Rumor has it they are in the process of building a bigger/better place in Mira Mesa.  Regardless, this is a place you need to go to.",50,AleSmith Brewing Company,April 2015
Techkraut,Excellent selection of high and low gravity craft beers,"This review is for the Cabot Drive tasting room location.  AleSmith is currently building out a new location a couple of blocks away.  The new location is known as the Observation Room and is already open for limited hours.  The Cabot Drive location is small with seating for >20 at bar tables and standing room for maybe another 30-40.  The atmosphere is modern pub meets sports bar.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  You order at the walk-up bar at 2-3 locations.  Traffic sometimes backed up a bit, but waiting time on a wednesday evening remained reasonable.  I thoroughly enjoyed the beers on tap, which can be previewed online.  Whether you are a Horny Devil (tm) or and Old Numbskull (tm), AleSmith offers a beer to match your disposition.  For an insider house blend, you may want to ask for a brain freeze.  Another amazing brew currently on tap is Decadence, which is basically a wheat version of a barley wine.  I had never tasted or even seen that beer type before.",50,AleSmith Brewing Company,July 2015
Kenmarsam,Great beer great people,We stopped by with some friends because we wanted to try the Tony Gwynn beer. All the beers we tried were excellent and the staff is amazing. They are all very friendly and knowledgeable about their beer. We thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent at the brewery. I would highly recommend the beer and will definitely go back when I am in the San Diego area. They are the  second oldest brewery in San Diego and I can see why they have been in business for 20 years.  ,50,AleSmith Brewing Company,September 2015

Took my two year old grandson who spent time trying to figure out why the mannequin police officer wouldn't say ""hi"" back to him. :) The Steve McQueen display was amazing. Have a passion for motorbikes and was surprised at how many were on display. The museum is small museum but they have some awesome automobiles and motorbikes. Was intrigued by Louis Mattar's car as I had never heard about it before. Will definitely go back and put it on the list to take my folks to next time they visit. Dad has a bigger passion for motorbikes than I do so I know he will love the bikes on display.",50,San Diego Automotive Museum,February 2017

Celebrating its centenary this years, the building bears an architectural style that bears a resemblance to colonial Spanish and Mexican buildings.  Its whitewashed exterior features a pair of bell-towers, each of which is capped with a tile-covered dome.  There's an airy sense of space inside with a high multi-beam arched ceiling.  Look at the walls and you'll find them covered with a tiled panels with a design that celebrates San Diego.

We went in the lat afternoon to try Alesmith's selection and were very pleased.  Sample prices were great and it gave us an opportunity to try things we can't get in our hometown.  You will need a car to get here if from out of town but definitely worth the trip if you are a beer lover and enthusiast.,50,AleSmith Brewing Company,October 2014

Omar N,Small but still cool,"The collection on display is pretty small but nevertheless still awesome! If you're a car enthusiast you will enjoy killing sometime here looking at the current collection on display.

Alexandra T,Small but well designed,"The San Diego Automotive Museum is in Balboa Park, so there is a lot of free parking available. The special exhibit was about station wagons. There were old commercials from the 50's about the newest and latest do-it-all car, and quite a few examples of station wagons through the decades. There is also a motorcycle display and a wonderful display of Louie Mattar's $75,000 car. Louie bought a 1947 Cadillac and in 1952 drove it non-stop from San Diego to New York and back! The actual Cadillac is on display with a video detailing his spectacular car and subsequent interviews with Louie. He is a CHARACTER! ",50,San Diego Automotive Museum,November 2016

It was very busy, so I wish there were a few more tables, but we were able to find a counter to stand at without much difficulty. I really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. People even had their dogs and kids with them! They have sodas and water for people not wanting to drink beer. No kitchen, but they have food trucks scheduled that you can buy from and bring in!

Allison D,Great Beach Camping Spot,"As many reviewers have noted, this is a great state park campground located on a bluff above the Pacific Ocean.  Overall, the sites are large and well maintained.  Ocean-front sites are $50 per night, while the inland sites (closer to Carlsbad Blvd) go for $35 a night.  Spend the extra $15 a night and reserve an ocean-front site - it's well worth it!!  Sites book up months in advance for the summer season, but you can usually get a spot during the off season.  Park rangers strictly enforce the 2 pm check-in time, so don't try to check in early.  Showers are plentiful and take tokens to operate.  Tokens are dispensed from a machine near the camp store and take bills only, no coins.  $1 will get you 2 tokens (6 minutes of shower time).  Don't worry if you forget something - the camp store is well stocked and there are plenty of stores within a two mile drive of the campground (including Costco).  Kick back, enjoy the view and watch pelicans soar by.",40,South Carlsbad State Beach,March 2013

coharahawk,Simply awesome beer,"Alesmith has a very strong reputation for brewing great beer within the craft beer community.   I've visited the brewery on 3 occasions now. They have remodeled significantly for the past few years.  They are located in an industrial park and you will likely be making a special trip there (unless you happen to work nearby). The tasting room consists of a fairly large area with oak barrels serving as cocktail tables.   The severs/brewery staff are all extremely friendly and willing to help you out with selecting beers. The draft list is always amazing with several rarities. The beer is served in $1 tasters that are about 2-3 ounces and allows you to try several beers.  There is no food.  This place is simply awesome, and I will make an attempt to visit anytime I'm in the SD area.",50,AleSmith Brewing Company,March 2012

Justin V,"Great beer, small space",Alesmith brews so many good beers that I don't even know where to begin. If you have never tried a beer straight from the tap at a brewery I suggest you do so. The smells and flavors you experience are on a whole other level than those of bottled beers. The tasting room can get a bit crowded and food is only available on Fridays via a food truck but it is well worth the sacrifice.,40,AleSmith Brewing Company,August 2012

I was able to take numerous photo's and we had an interesting conversation with one of the antique car owners who said he visits with customers one day a week. The museum included antique motorcycles as well as antique autos and special models of limited edition sports cars. It took a little over an hour to take it all in. It was a worthwhile visit that we both enjoyed for a very reasonable price.",50,San Diego Automotive Museum,September 2016
Icb1976,Not much there,They have a pretty good motorcycle collection but the car collection needs some serious help. They have a mirror on one wall that makes it look the size size it should be. We bought a groupon so it only cost us $4 each. The staff inside was really nice and willing to tell the history. It was just a ways out of down town to see such a small collection. Kids would probably like a few of the cars like the green hornet or the long distance car. ,20,San Diego Automotive Museum,October 2016

Ryan M,Definitely a brewery to visit!,"This place is awesome/standard/alright all at the same time.  I always want to avoid drinking and driving, so the location is a shame for me, because I don't want to hang out in that area, but maybe it's getting better....  As far as many micro-brews, they have the standards: food truck grub option, growlers, t-shirts, etc...  What steals the show for me, they have some excellent stouts!  I've been on a bit of a stout kick for the past two years, and so far, in all of San Diego, for me, they have the best stout!  The Dark Seas Imperial Stout.  Very Rich!  Have fun!",50,Mission Brewery,May 2014
Simpsonatc22,Lost my business,We weren't sure where it was so we called and called and called. Nobody would pick up the phone so they clearly didn't want our business that badly. ,10,Mission Brewery,May 2014
Ronnie_texas67uk,Scobby Van!,Wasn't expecting much and greatly surprised by this gem of a museum. Well worth the visit. Now if they'd of allowed me to drive away in that .....,50,San Diego Automotive Museum,July 2016

Such variety of history cars and movie cars with a wonderful display of motorcycles too!  No one was bored today!  ,50,San Diego Automotive Museum,August 2016
GriseldaC2,Small but Good,"1st time going to any of the museums in Balboa Park. I took a nephew to this museum since he is into cars. It IS small, but decent. He really enjoyed the motorcycle exhibit. I enjoyed the Star Cars exhibit, short but nice.",30,San Diego Automotive Museum,August 2016
Columbus9,Absolutely Great,We found a Groupon to attend and it was worth way more than the price of admission.  There is a lot to read and experience.  A real diamond in the rough type of museum.,50,San Diego Automotive Museum,August 2016
sulphursister,Site 52 - Awesome spot!,"This is a nice larger campsite where the ocean is your backyard.    Went here on a Monday, and the campground was basically empty.....won't be the case after Memorial Day but it sure was a nice evening out with friends.   Site 52 is a great spot!",40,South Carlsbad State Beach,May 2013
J Warren R,Must visit while in San Diego,"Located in the old Wonder Bread factory, this brewery rocks.  Most if not all of their beers are available on tap.  After a flight of 4, the bartender took a few of us at the bar on a tour to show the whole production line.  Great to see an old facility be put to good use. Mission has an attractive setting, decent location downtown and friendly staff.  No food served on premisis so you’ll have to have a liquid meal or hope the food trucks come by.  Overall a fun place, with a wonderful selection of beer.",50,Mission Brewery,February 2015
Victoria K,Fun Tasting and Tour at Mission Brewery through a Groupon,"Bought a $17 groupon for my husband for tour and tasting for 2.  Very fun.  Only 13 people in the group - wide range of ages.  5 tasting samples - all of which were delicious and very generous!  Got a free glass at the end too.  No food, but food truck(s) outside - kind of fun!  Recommended for something different to do!  April 2015 - I still see the offer on Groupon!  Nice building - 100 years old - it was the original Wonder Bread Factory in San Diego!",40,Mission Brewery,April 2015
mr_hand,impressive beers from a low-key brewery.  the hard root beer is a home run!,"We were recommended this place by a lady we met and we were glad we checked it out.  We stopped in during a Padres game and there were only a couple other people inside.  The beers are good and they have plenty on tap.  The bartender was great, giving us samples and telling us of the history of the place.  We were told the hard root beer was one of their more popular beers - a combo of their porter and their root beer and it was awesome.  Can't wait to be able to buy it here in Texas.   Beers are reasonably priced here as well",40,Mission Brewery,April 2015
Louise M,More than just a tasting room!,"I usually can't find a lot of things to taste at a brewery as I am not much of a beer drinker.  They had so many options, like the hard root beer, that I had no trouble finding enough to make a tasting worthwhile!",50,Mission Brewery,April 2015
baywatcheroly,"Great selection, great pricing.",Enjoyed this small brewery.  Great selection.  Took the advice of the brew staff and tried their limited Speedway Stout with Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee!!  EXCELLENT!  But we are there for the IPA's...and they were good too.  Taster's started at $1....,40,AleSmith Brewing Company,January 2015
jmiller559,Great Tasting Room,The AleSmith tasting room is a little off the beaten path but worth the search. Their selection is good with a large group that are only available at the tasting room including a cask beer. ,50,AleSmith Brewing Company,January 2015

Opened in 1915 at a cost of over $300,000, the architects, Bakewell and Brown of San Francisco, drew on the Spanish, Moorish and Mexican lines exhibited by the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, located in the town of Oceanside north of San Diego.  The grand interior of the depot features natural redwood beams and brightly colored ceramic tile wainscot.",40,Santa Fe Depot,September 2015
zmclain75,It's OK,"Don't go out of your way to see this Union Station, but if you're nearby, it's probably worth stopping in just to see it.  Make sure you aren't stopping in to use the restroom though, we couldn't find any for the public which is understandable considering the area and the homeless problem.",30,Santa Fe Depot,September 2015
pgm1212,Great Place For Young Kids! (Better for kids than the North Carlsbad Beach....),"We found this beach at the end of our stay, but really enjoyed.  There is a small break near the shore in shallow water so the kids can just stand there with their boogie boards and jump in front of the waves.  The bottom is all sand.  My kids were all novices but they had a great time.  We found this place on the last 2 days of the trip which were Saturday and Sunday and we went both days.  The beach was fairly crowded by mid day, but not uncomfortably so.  I wonder what it looks like during the week in terms of crowds...  Parking was a little tricky.  A lot of the locals like to park on the side of PCH because you don't have to pay, but this parking was filled up by the time we got there each day.  There is a pay parking spot ($15 for the day on weekends and you can pay by the hour on weekdays).  It is a little tricky to find and I drove by it the first time.  It is right at the end of the beach where there are a large amount of cars parked on the sand.  Right past this area is a small road that leads to the parking area so you want to veer right onto that... I have 5 year olds, a 9 year old, and a 12 year old.  They all enjoyed this beach very much.  They didn't really like the North Carlsbad Beach very much....",50,South Carlsbad State Beach,August 2013
SweetassOC,"Great Beach, OK Camping",The middle of the campground has the best beach with multiple stairways down.  The south end has a more rocky beach and the north end has fewer ways down to the beach.  I'd recommend you spend the extra money to get a cliff spot as opposed to the one nearer PCH.  Waking to the sound of waves is always a great thing.,40,South Carlsbad State Beach,August 2013
337justing,Great place to meet locals!,We ate at the food truck and tasted their yummy alcoholic root beer. Good place to meet locals and a pub you can bring pets too. ,40,Mission Brewery,May 2015
Kenmarsam,Good beer fun place,The beer at Mission is very good. We tried 7 different beers and didn't find one that wasn't a quality product. The building is very old but they have done a great job with it. The Hard Root beer was very good. Make sure you say hi to daisy the chocolate lab that serves as the official greeter.,40,Mission Brewery,September 2015

We will be returning every SD trip we make! ,50,Mission Brewery,September 2015
DawnandPeteF,Good brew concepts,Nice brew house and tap room; an easy walk from the convention center.  Had the tasting flights and enjoyed each one.  The spiced amber seasonal was my favorite.  The staff was friendly as well.  They have different food trucks each day. ,40,Mission Brewery,October 2015
Tpolisher,Mmmmm beer!,"This review is for the Cabot Dr location. The brewery is small but they were getting ready to move to a new location.

Karen S,Camping on the bluffs was extra nice,"We took the kids camping at S. Carlsbad State Beach campground on a beautiful, hot March weekend.  Our spot was huge and on the bluffs over-looking the ocean.  It was the perfect spot.  We were just a few spots away from the stairs to the beach (very convenient) and near the bathrooms.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the dirty bathroom with no toilet paper and the confusion we had over shower tokens.  The shower tokens were minor but the bathrooms got pretty messy (the campground was full) and quickly ran out of toilet paper.  Fortunately, we always have extra tp with us (3 kids and all).  We loved it and can't wait to go back in June.",40,South Carlsbad State Beach,March 2014

Pete7919,Good beers but I wish they had food,I just wish it was easier to get food.  I had walked over from Gaslamp and it got a little dark and unwelcoming on the way.

StuartGustafson,Great Brews and Atmosphere,"We went to AleSmith primarily because of their 394 Pale Ale (that honors Tony Gwynn's 1994 Batting Average of .394). We sampled a few others, such as the Spring Bock and the Speedway Stout (that one's a bit heavy for me!). Everyone was quite friendly and I'm looking forward the opening of the Tony Gwynn Pavilion that they're assembling!",50,AleSmith Brewing Company,May 2016
HollyBerryElf,charming old station .. sadly overshadowed by skyscrapers,"a place to see some of the charm of old-time train travel ... lots of ceramic tiles on the walls, Spanish style arches for the side rooms and overhead, even some of the old signs (such as the ""Ladies Waiting Room"").  Sadly San Diego has chosen to let new construction intrude on the station so you miss much of the charm.  A sad loss ....",40,Santa Fe Depot,June 2016

NWTravelerz,Fun Brewery to Check Out,"We went here a couple times during our stay in San Diego, mostly because it had great beer and it was close to where we were staying. I enjoyed a flight both times, because there was just too much to choose from! (Their hard root beer is definitely work trying, even for beer fans.) Rustic warehouse setting with no outdoor area that I saw, so bring a jacket if you're used to the San Diego heat. No food served, although they offer chips and salsa and some bagged snacks. Still, we spent hours here and loved it!",50,Mission Brewery,February 2016

The high wooden ceilings with sky lights and chandeliers are beautiful. There is a large bar and a lot of big tables so plenty of space to gather and hangout. We like to do flights and really liked all of the Mission beers we tried. We collect pint glasses and the logo is cool so that was a bonus.

TallTexWally,Historic Train Station in Downtown San Diego,"The Santa Fe Depot is one of the most outstanding historical railroad stations in California.  It was opened in 1915 to handle the many visitors coming to San Diego for the Panama-California Exposition in Balboa Park.  It was built on a grand scale in the Spanish Colonial Style.  It's still a fully functional railroad station, with Amtrak trains arriving and departing daily, as well as the busy San Diego Trolley stopping here.  The interior is large, with many interesting architectural features.  It's located at 1050 Kettner Blvd.  Pacific Highway and San Diego Bay is just to the west.  Broadway, which heads east through the heart of downtown San Diego, is just to the south.  A lot of historic train stations across the USA have either been abandoned or torn down.  I'm glad San Diego still has the Santa Fe Depot intact, and it is worth a visit.",50,Santa Fe Depot,June 2016

Sadly the high rise buildings are developing nearby and this land mark may be lost from a harbor view.,30,Santa Fe Depot,October 2016
Michael H,The California Coaster,"We arrived by ship, and it was only a few blocks to the Santa Fe Station. There we boarded an AMTRAK train which would honor our California Coastal online pre-purchased tickets. Don't sweat the cost (Seniors 3-zone RT $5.50), it's the bargain of the century. For a nice, relaxed, scenic ride up to Oceanside with 7 other destinations provided, the Coaster is the way to go. Best of all, you avoid all the traffic congestion in the area. Our ride back was on a California Coaster train.",50,Santa Fe Depot,October 2016

The lower 180s and upper 170s are small lots with little privacy.

Christopher E,"Interesting museum, but a bit small","I love cars and was excited to visit the San Diego Automotive museum. I went with my brother and 7 year old niece. The museum had a lot of interesting motorcycles as well as some cool cars - Lamborghini Countach, Bizzarini, Ford Bronco, Austin taxi, Cadillac V16..and the star of the whole place: Louie Mattar and his 1947 Cacillad car and trailer - the fabulous 75.000 dollar car! Seeing this made the visit worth it! I felt that otherwise, the place was a bit small and there were too many hot rods and custom cars for my liking. However, if in the Balboa Park area, go and check it out! You can also visit the Aeronautical museum next door and the Museum of Art, which is only a close walk away.",30,San Diego Automotive Museum,March 2018

Traveling with four children under 10, we took about an hour inside. With our AAA discount it was the cheapest thing we did in San Diego. (Bonus, the air & space museum is right next door.)

They have an impressive array of guns from the ""olden days"" to present. If you are interested in history or law enforcement, don’t miss it.  Free admission with donations requested.",50,Sheriff's Museum,July 2015

Link2Leo,"genuine, unforgettable SoCal experience","Noticed that people are confusing SOUTH Carlsbad State Beach (campsite on the beach) and Carlsbad State Beach (camping NOT allowed). Both beaches are incredible but do beware of rocks, n coastal erosion. There is public access through the campsite so if you're jogging, biking, or skating why not just go through it rather than parallel to it? ",50,South Carlsbad State Beach,March 2015
mommy_from_YVR,BEST camping with view of the beach!,We LOVED our camping here! Too bad we could only get 1 night. We stayed at site #6 and it was perfect! Didn't have to back up into our site. Our site was sideways and parked our van and pop-up tent trailer without having to back up a million times to readjust. We had unobstructed views of the beach. The sunset was beautiful! We were across the street from the washroom/showers/garbage. Extremely convenient as we had 3 kids. Short walk back to the entrance and the stairs down to the beach. LOVE this beach! Kids loved the swimming and boogie boarding! Only downside is this place is very hard to book (hence we only got 1 night).,50,South Carlsbad State Beach,August 2015

rizznizz,Beautiful fairly quiet camping.,"We stay here a few times a year. Always have a great time. The view is awesome and a lot of times you can see whales right off the beach. Beach side sites are the way to go. These sites fill up real fast so make your reservations WAY in advance.  The campsites are all different shapes and sizes so go on a campsite photos website to make sure you will fit comfortably. This place is fairly quiet for the most part. I'm talking about ""neighbor noise"". Like every other campground,  you can end up with noisy people next to you but this place is pretty good about regulating noise.

Williwillinui,"Relatively flat stroll suitable to walk, run, ride horse or bike","I enjoyed this 6.5 mile out and back hike near Poway - roughly 15 minutes from the San Diego city center in good traffic.  There's pockets of shade, and due the the recent rain-also pockets of muddiness.  There are parts that parallel the main route, but are off limits for bikes closer to the creek bed or along it.  Plenty of locals flock here to walk their dogs and get their exercise in.  The waterfall is off the main trail but only about a minute or two (shortly after mile marker 3).  I didn't like the horse droppings along the route-dog owners were good at carrying out their trash when I was there.  Overall, a great place to walk a dog or exercise.  For the most part it's fairly flat.  The little bit of elevation change is short-lived.  There's a port-a-potty at the start of the trail in the parking lot area.  It costs 3 dollars to park here.  Keep in mind mountain lions do live in this area, and while attacks on humans aren't too common, children should not hike far ahead of a group or behind.",40,Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve,March 2012
InquiringMind99,Kind of a suburban oasis with more trails than advertised,I think you could continue on after the waterfall but we decided to double back at that point.  This hike is well worth the time invested in my opinion.,40,Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve,July 2012
msdvah,Messy trails,"The hike was a good change and not very strenuous, but soem of the pathways were a bit messy because of the horses leaving there messes behind, but after gettine pass that after 2.3 miles then it was more enjoyable , and teh streams were nice to see along the trails, I would say it was a good place to hike and it's not difficult.",30,Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve,August 2012
ianwyj,A pleasant walk year-round,"At just under a mile and a half from the northern curve of North Harbor Drive near the airport to its southern end, the waterfront walkway is a pleasant 30-minute walk/stroll, or longer if you choose to take in the sights.  I find it hard to describe the walk as scenic but it does have its highlights.  Avant-garde standing sculptures and mosaic-decorated benches provide a sense of artistic flair along the upper stretch of the walkway.  The docks for the ferries that do whale- and dolphin-sighting cruises are usually busy several times a day.  Then there are the historic boats berthed around the Maritime Museum, including the 18th-century HMS Surprise and the World War Two submarine USS Dolphin.  And how could you miss the huge and still-magnificent USS Midway, now a museum?  Further south, you'll find the fishing boat marina and the pierside market as well as several good seafood restaurants.  Finally at the southern-most end of the walk, you'll come across Seaport Village, another nice place for a bite and a spot of shopping.",40,Waterfront Walkway,November 2014

The personnel at the ticket counter are a friendly group who are very helpful in providing great travel tips for your trip.  One might be mindful to line up outside about a half hour before your scheduled departure instead of waiting until the boarding announcement is made over the public address system.  If not, you will end up in the rear of a long line that has already formed for boarding.  The boarding process is smooth and moves quickly.  For approximately $20. more you can travel in Business Class which is well worth the extra expenditure for the added comfort.  I am looking forward to the next opportunity to travel to and/or from this lovely, old train station.",40,Santa Fe Depot,September 2017

When I went into the bathroom it was dirty and disgusting and smelled bad, so I got out of there as quick as I could. If you are not riding the Amtrak or Coaster I would not recommend stopping here.

Scarlettangel,Must see!!!,"We tried to visit this museum a couple of times but found it closed, luckily we went back on our last day and it was open. Worth noting they do not open on Mondays and Tuesdays. I have to say this place is well worth a visit, its a free museum though you can leave donations if you want to. Its a very hands on museum, where you can climb on the motorcycles, get in the police cars, sit in the witness stand etc. We got some amazing photo's. There are loads of exhibits, a couple of short videos and lots of things to look at. The staff were fabulous and I cannot praise this place enough. Its an absolute gem. I grew up watching US cop shops, and it was like walking through the set of one of them. We spent a couple of hours there and would have stayed longer if we'd had the time. I was surprised that some folks came in, walked around and left. They missed out on a lot. Please go along and support the museum - gift shop also full of goodies.",50,Sheriff's Museum,March 2016

Nicely set up so that you can actually put on a bullet proof vest and experience the weight of this and the other equipment that they have to carry. Also great for taking photos wearing this equipment, in a judge's robe, or take a fake mug shot. It is self guided through several rooms that come alive with some sound effects and good photos.

On a whim, we bought tickets to this show for a night out. We had no idea what to expect out of ""immersive experience"" of urban dance, but we were delighted by it nonetheless!  Each of the dozen dancers was incredibly impressive. The show--though the plot was a bit hard to follow with minimal dialogue--culminated in a crescendo of better and better choreographed sequences.  Highly recommended!  (Though a word on seating--all the seats are roughly equivalent in such a small theater, so go with the cheaper ones).",50,Beyond Babel,February 2019

In a small 130 seat theater. you are right there & experiencing this epic dance-opera.  There was extraordinary dancing, choreography and scenery.  The creators and the dancers are among the best.   I was unprepared for the high level of professionalism given the Imperial Ave location.  I have paid much more to see many various types of dance recitals.  This was most assuredly my favorite.  I will be coming back to see more.  It is just a wonderful experience.  You feel like you are seeing the birth of a new dance form.",50,Beyond Babel,February 2019

Kevin B,5 1/2 hours spent away from the rat race!!,"So I read some of the posts and am disappointed with some of the complaints.  This is a very leisurely hike through the canyon preserve.  This has wide trails for everyone from walkers/joggers/runners/bikers/horseback riders.  And there were a lot of folks walking their dogs as well.  This is the place for everyone.  Also seen a lot of folks that were not so outdoorsy...not so fit type but this is the place to get the body moving without serious strain on the body.  The trail meanders on the both the north and south side of the creek and the trails are easily marked to criss cross the water in various areas.  Your highlight as it shows in the photos is a small waterfall that is surprisingly refreshing after nearly 3 miles out to it.  Depending on the time of day you will see mule deer (sunset/sunrise) and coyotes.  Also says to keep an eye out for bobcats and mountain lions on some of the postings.  Parking is free and unsure why some mentioned paying? You park at or near the ball fields and walk in about 5 minutes to the entrance.  We picnicked on the ground near the waterfall as well so just sit back and enjoy!!  Highly recommend for smaller kids, kids with bikes, whatever!!",50,Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve,January 2015

In celebration of their 30th anniversary, the theme the day we visited was a ""re-cap"" display: one example from each of the various themed exhibits they had held during the past few decades; this made for an interesting mix. In one corner of the showroom, there was a video featuring the ""plank highway"" that once existed in Arizona--very interesting and new to us.

Eric E,"Good beer, poor service",The beer is good but the staff needs to be taught how to serve its customers.  Senior management should take a hard look at the customer experience and re-calibrate.,20,AleSmith Brewing Company,October 2017
Overlooker,A step back in time,The building has the grace of an old rail depot and some nice flourishes such as handmade tile. There is a nice courtyard outside the old main entrance.,40,Santa Fe Depot,April 2018
388masumiy,Beautiful ,"This is a very beautiful architecture which is still used as a real train station. Even though your itinerary has nothing to do with train ride, it is still worthwhile to visit here. It is like a scene from old movie.",50,Santa Fe Depot,April 2018
Nprus,It's The Amtrak Station !,"We weren't disappointed though, as the outside and inside of the building is spectacular.  Built in the Spanish Colonial Revival Style (no we're not architects, we Googled it !), the building is on the National Register of Historic Places.  It includes a lovely waiting area, a small snack shop, and a nice rack of brochures of places to go and see.",40,Santa Fe Depot,April 2018
lovetotravel92630,Sante Fe Depot train station is a amazing architectural gem built in 1915,"The Sante Fe Depot train station (Union Station) is an architectural gem constructed in 1915 for Panama-California Exposition. The train depot is the southern terminus of the Amtrak and Coast train lines. Also you can get a San Diego Trolley  at the train station.  Special note to look at the wall tiles, beautiful and craftsmanship of a former period. This is the perfect starting point for a walking tour of downtown San Diego and the water front boardwalk from the Maritime Museum of San Diego to Seaport Village. The waterfront area is about a three block walk or you can take one of the several other transportation modes along the Boardwalk, including Pedi-cabs, rental bikes or scooters. I prefer to walk as I have more flexibility in stopping and seeing the sights. Along the Boardwalk is the San Diego Maritime Museum, Midway aircraft carrier, several memorials and Seaport Village. If you drive, parking can be an issue on busy weekends, so the trolley/train option is great. There are ample areas in beautifully landscaped areas to sit on a bench and watch the people and enjoy the cool of the ocean front.",40,Santa Fe Depot,July 2018
DannyWasserman,Great Depot for moving around the area  !!,"This is a busy place.  It reminds me a lot of Grand Central in New York City, but on the west coast.  The lines aren't too bad and they can pretty much take you where ever you need to go.  Very spacious and the attendants are very friendly.",50,Santa Fe Depot,April 2018
noddie11,"Wonderful, informative and fun hands on museum","Really interesting insight into the law enforcement departments. A couple of touching displays around staff who had lost their lives in service. Very helpful staff and lots of fun photo opportunities. No entrance fee but donations. Well worth at least the $5 suggested. 4 ladies from UK spent a very fun afternoon here, with lots of photos to show!",50,Sheriff's Museum,October 2016
davidmP7608YO,Very Good Law Enforcement Museum,"If you like law enforcement ""stuff"", this is a good place to visit.  There are many separate rooms and displays to visit over the two floors of the museum.  Vehicles, badges, uniforms, jail cells, weapons and so on.  Interactive things for children to do. This venue is also free but donations are accepted.  A gift shop with various items is also on site.  Highly recommended.",50,Sheriff's Museum,October 2016
CascadiaPNW,Great Fun and Interesting!,"We had a great time at this free museum in the Old Town area of San Diego.  There were lots of interactive displays that I think people of all ages would enjoy.  There were also a couple of interesting exhibits about specific crimes in San Diego Co, including the people who got sucked into the Heaven's Gate community and eventually committed suicide together.  There was also a sobering memorial to the men and women who have lost their lives in the line of duty.",40,Sheriff's Museum,October 2016
NYCaliKara,Fun for a Quick Visit,"It would budget to spend about 45-90 minutes at this museum.  It's located in Old Town, so you could combine this with a visit to one of the delicious Mexican restaurants and the historic park.",40,Sheriff's Museum,May 2016
danlou324,Short fun activity,"Hubby and I are both very interested in Law Enforcement and corrections. This was fun to walk around and speak with some good old boys.

Hannah A,A MUST WATCH FOR DANCERS AND NON-DANCERS,This show is a must watch. The sheer talent of each and every dancer on the cast is absolutely INSANE.

Peachez X,Beyond Amazing,Writing this during intermission. This is an amazing show. I don’t even need to finish it to tell my friends to come watch.

James H,Stunning Ocean Views,Great State Park with limited full RV hookups.  Spaces are large and wide.  Rules say max size is 35' but they are very lenient and we saw many at the 38-40' length.  Easy walk to the beach and plenty of restrooms and showers.  Excellent dry camping sites overlooking the beach and ocean.  Small convenience store.  Rates for full hookups is a little pricey @ $75 per night but the view makes it worthwhile.,50,South Carlsbad State Beach,September 2016
NickiG555,Great Carlsbad Beach,"South Carlsbad Beach, or Ponto Beach as the locals call it, is a great beach for walking along.  I have started here and walked all the way to Encinitas when the tide is out.  The locals like to park right along the roadside, but there is a parking lot.  Of course, it is an undeveloped beach area and does not have the amenities that Moonlight Beach in Encinitas, but it is a great walking beach, and good for a picnic, and good for launching your kayak and such, if that is what you like to do, although I prefer La Jolla Cove for kayaking.  It's the best in my opinion.",40,South Carlsbad State Beach,September 2016
Brandon H,Great place to camp!,"Man can't beat the price for this location! Great ocean views and beach access. Great people too. The camp store is reasonably priced, in fact get your fire wood there, at the Ralph's down the street, it's 2 doll hairs more. Since the campground is on a cliff, you do have stairs that could be rough for some people. If that's the case we drove to Oceanside everyday for the beach, since you could literally park the car and walk across the street. No electricity at this campsite, so have battery banks or solar charging available yourself. Bathrooms were clean and presentable. ",50,South Carlsbad State Beach,September 2016
James W,Terrific beach,"This is one of our favorite beaches to visit in this area. Of course living close to it helps. The picture shows it realistically and it is frequently not crowded. Good waves for surfing and boogie boarding. Smooth sand and warm sunshine, what more could you ask for?",50,South Carlsbad State Beach,October 2016
HappyAdventures41,Beautiful Place to Camp!,"My son had booked our campsite months ahead to get a spot so if you want to camp here you need to plan ahead for sure.  We were right on the ocean side and could hear the waves all night long...so peaceful to be lulled to sleep by.  The bathrooms were individual, clean and well light.  There were a number of step accesses to the beaches.  The beaches were well maintained and not to crowded.  Though the camping spots were close together there was brush between each spot so it felt somewhat private.  We would return here for sure!",40,South Carlsbad State Beach,September 2016

Sal_Paradise767,Great Brewery,"The neighborhood this place is in is a little sketchy but the brewery makes visiting worth it.  It's in a massive former Wonder Bread factory and it retains the feel.  They have a ton of rotating taps with a focus on IPAs (great for a Hop Head like me) and all pints are a reasonable $6.  They do have flights, Cannons and Growlers and there's also shuffle board.  I don't know much about their food options except that they have home made chips and salsa for $9.  Definitely worth a visit.",50,Mission Brewery,November 2017

KramerOn,Nice place to hang out and taste some good beers,"The Mission Brewery leans a little more toward dive than some of the slicker craft breweries in San Diego. Just a little. And that's a good thing. It felt comfortable. The beers we sampled were good. I liked their system of writing the names of the beers you want on the tasting board with an erasable marker. There were quite a few people there when we visited, and it didn't feel crowded, and wasn't too noisy. Dogs are allowed, including a really cute, calm one during our time there. We played some shuffle board in the shadow of the big stainless tanks.",50,Mission Brewery,December 2017

urbanrenewal,An unexpected detour,"On our first trip to this area, we just glanced at the map at the trailhead and even took a picture of it, but didn't really pay much attention.  Well, there are only a few crossings over the creek in the bottom of the canyon--so to make a long story short, we did more hiking than we expected and even did a crotch deep crossing (this was shortly after the big rain).  But it was an adventure and lots of fun.",40,Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve,January 2016

TravelBuddy0406,Nice views and good historical tour,"Don't let the amount of steps stop you from going on this tour. They're easy steps to navigate and there is a landing to rest and receive historical info along the way. Gives you time to get ready for the next set of stairs. My only wish was that we could have gone all the way to the top, but because the staircase isn't structurly sound, that's not possible.

Radiohutch,Interesting Small Museum in Balboa Park,"Recently Lynn and I and friends visited the San Diego Auto Museum. This was not only our first visit to this museum, it was also our first visit to Balboa Park. There are many museums, a zoo  and other attractions in this Park so be sure that you know exactly where you are going. There are several large free parking lots. The museum is not large, but it seems that every car displayed had an interesting story behind it. Many were previously owned by celebrities. For instance there was a British cab that had been owned by Frank Sinatra. One of the many motorcycles on display was owned by Evil Knievel. ($8.00 senior). I liked the museum and look forward to visiting other attractions in Balboa Park in the future. ",40,San Diego Automotive Museum,May 2019

Then we moved on to the lower main part of the museum where you can take a mug shot, listen to story about first women sheriff, look at various communications devices, you can sit on a motorcycle and go inside a police car and helicopter, upstairs they have a crime scene laid out, and the kids can dress up as a judge. Totally recommend for kids/family",50,Sheriff's Museum,March 2018

The beach & ocean offered a great escape from triple digit heat.

Extraordinary806577,Winter camping trip,"Was lucky to score a double full hookup site facing the beach this past weekend. Not an easy thing to do, even in the winter. Site 220 had the most beautiful views, it was amazing. We were able to see dolphins, surfers and even a whale. Gravel was a little messy the first night since it was sprinkling, made quite a mess. A large rug would have been great. Site included a table and firepit, one less thing to pack. Had zero shade so an easy up is recommended. It had a lot of stairs down to the beach, 93 to be exact.. lol but so worth it. Lots of rocks at beach so it's best to wait for a low tide to get some sand if the kids plan on playing in the water. The beach was so peaceful and empty (it is Jan). It was a great bike ride around the park and bathrooms were clean and well stocked. This is now one of my favorite parks!

Sand between the toes and a few chilly dunks in the 60 degree water will always stimulate the senses and make you miss the ocean.  This day we saw a huge pod of dolphins 100+ and whales about a mile off shore.  The whales breached three times and fully came out of the water, wow!!  It was later in the afternoon so they were back-lit so even with binoculars we could not distinguish the exact type of whale but assume it was a Gray Whale since its that time of year.

dougs477,Heritage Homes,"We enjoyed strolling the grounds around each of these beautiful homes at Heritage County Park that have been relocated to this new location from where eachnwere originally built in the city. The detailing of the exterior craftsmanship represents a time gone by. The interior of the homes must have been just as beautiful. One can only image as the homes have not had the interiors finished for touring, which is the old disappointment about visiting the park. ",40,Heritage County Park,March 2016
sarahe832,Beautiful,"This is one of my favourite parts of San Diego. Tucked behind the Mormon Battalion just outside Old Town this area is made up of a cul-de-sac of wooden houses moved to this location from elsewhere. One is a little museum, the others aren't open but you can wander right up to them. When we went there was only us there so we got some beautiful photos. There's a nature trail walk up at the back of one of the last houses on the left which leads you up onto the hillside & gives a brilliant view down over the street & beyond. It feels like you are on a film set as the area is so peaceful, unspoilt & a bit surreal. A flock of green & red parrots were feasting on the tree on the roundabout when we were there which made this extra special. Historically the synagogue welcomed people of other faiths to use its facilities before they had their own & you can still go inside today. I'd highly recommend a visit to Heritage Park.

Melissa H,"Nice, but not too much to see.","We decided to hike to the waterfall and it was about 2-3 miles each way.  The area was beautiful, but much of the site was the same throughout the hike.  By the time we reached the waterfall, it was little lackluster.  On top of it, there was a kids camp (~30 kids) that were there in their swimsuits all over the area.  Needless to say, not many pictures could be taken and it was not a time for relaxing with all those kids there.  I wouldn't do it again that's for sure.  Torrey Pines was a much better area for us to hike.",30,Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve,June 2017
kelly f,LITTLE SHADE!,"I would not necessarily call the water source we played in a ""waterfall"" as the signs and other reviews labeled it. We did hike 3.2 miles to the creek surrounded by boulders with several pools. It must have been Boys and Girls Hike Day so it was very crowded. There was very little shade on the majority of the hike--a few chaparral areas--so I recommend an early start, lots of water, and sunscreen. It is a very easy hike for all ages.

A small stream (no fishing) that has a waterfall during the rainy season can be found about 4 miles from the ranger station. Free parking is available. If you are lucky you might see some small wildlife.  Coyotes, skunks, squirrels, bobcat, raccoons, snakes, birds, lizards. If you stay on the trails a hike of 3-8 can be fun.

We stepped off at the small shopping village and walked back around the waterfront which takes you past the military ships/ museum and some great wartime statues.

The history with these homes and one Temple is one of a kind.  The vibrant colors and design will make you wish there was a listing to move in.  And in the center, a lovely Coral Tree that we first say in New Zealand.  That I may be able to get.  We were late in the evening and the homes were not open, but the stroll was great.

FunDiegoFamily,One of the Top Breweries in the US,"San Diego is known as the craft beer capital of the U.S.  In a short stretch along Miramar road there are some of the countries top breweries.  AleSmith is arguably on top of the list.  AleSmith is probably best known for its award-winning Speedway Stout.  It is a great beer but definitely not for everyone (12% ABV).  Thankfully AleSmith has all kinds of great beers, including a lager made in conjunction with the 1990s band Sublime (who broke up in tragic circumstances right as I was getting into them).  There is also a beer created with Tony Gwynn right before he died (.394 Pale Ale).  But the beer is actually only one reason to go to AleSmith.  This is one of the most family-friendly beer places around.  There is a huge open, two-story floor plan with a large outdoor patio.  There are games and an entire museum of Tony Gwynn memorabilia.  On my website, fundiegofamily.com, we are creating a guide on going to San Diego breweries with kids.  Right now AleSmith starts at the top of our list.",50,AleSmith Brewing Company,December 2018

Mister-Markie,Very cool hiiden gem!,"I can't say enough about how impressed I was with this museum. Formed through a non-profit organization, it is a work of love of the The Honorary Deputy Sheriffs Association. Their efforts are tremendous, and I know the sheriffs themselves have been supportive - this symbiotic relationship is evident in the beautiful and professional displays. Wherever you stand on some current issues of policing in the community, I think a visit here would be good for folks to see how vast, rich and intricate the history of the sheriff's department has been and continues to be as it evolves with technology and society. It was a pleasure to chat with the two retired deputies now volunteering their time to meet and greet visitors, and even help with a mock courtroom session!

outdoorsguy,My Favorite Beach To Camp At,"This is my favoite beach to camp at, second place/ close to a tie would be San Clemente State Beach. Being this far South the water is warmer than the farther North Beaches and the people are warmer and friendlier. They both sit on the bluff but have easy pathes to the beaches. The biggest plus for South Carlsbad is that 1/2 the campground is Ocean Side Vs. San Clamente only has 3 spots ocean side. Both are great spots though with clean showers and rest rooms",50,South Carlsbad State Beach,July 2019

This year, however, the bathrooms and showers were not maintained to the level that they were previously.  There were days where it was obvious that the bathrooms had not been cleaned a all.  There are a lot of campers there who rely on those bathrooms and they were a mess!! I do not expect spotless bathrooms while camping, but this was beyond gross.  I was also disgusted that they are taking donations to fix the stairs leading down the beaches.  We have surplus of a few billion dollars in California and we pay a lot of taxes here!  Send a few bucks to maintain the California state parks!  ",30,South Carlsbad State Beach,July 2019
FunDiegoFamily,Nice spot in Old Town,"Old Town San Diego is one of the cities busiest tourist attractions.  Heritage Park is a much quieter place across the street and up the hill from Old Town.  This small park has a nice grassy and several restored Victorian homes from the 1800s.  This includes San Diego's first synagogue.  With the exception of the synagogue and tea shop, and park office you can not go into the buildings.  However, the views of San Diego and Mission Bay are great.

Mister-Markie,Great place to get a sense of Old Town San Diego houses of a century ago!,"Came here before a visit to Old Town SHP, and was surprised by what I found! This park is an architectural museum of sorts, where the people of San Diego wisely and graciously chose to save some of their city's examples of old houses built and owned by some of the people who made San Diego what it is, from around the turn of the century (as opposed to Old Town SHP which showcases the colonial ere). A Jewish synagogue and six houses from the 1880-1890s are visual gems of a style of architecture and time long lost. The park is simply a replicated cobble-stone street and cul-de-sac, around which these buildings have all been relocated. The small red one, the Stennis Cottage has a one room historical display explaining some of this process. The temple, the first Jewish house of worship in San Diego, was actually cut in half to move it! A good place to start, this cottage room and the Temple Beth Israel (1889) are the only two buildings open to the interior for visitors. I would love to see other building renovated and restored for interior looks, as the architecture is so intriguing, McConaughy House (1887) has a small ""tea room"" operating within it as well. All in all a nice stroll, and if you love Victorian styles of architecture, this will be a great place for you!",40,Heritage County Park,October 2019
Pam S,Beautiful park of restored houses,"Started here before going to Old Town. The old original houses (1880-1890s) were moved here to this park and are a beautiful example of the early architecture of San Diego. Each house is totally different to the next & beautifully preserved, and has a description of its history. One house is open to the public, as a gift shop & tea rooms. The Jewish Synagogue is open & today is used by all religious faiths for weddings etc. Well worth a visit to this beautiful park.",50,Heritage County Park,September 2019

Didn’t love the barley wine myself as it was a little dark for my personal taste, but I’m sure there are others that would love it. Also liked the golden haze (can’t quite remember the whole name). Reasonably priced flights and pints, good options for beer, and frankly I loved that they’re cool with outside food. Not crowded, which is awesome, big venue, and random games available. Only downsides were the tabletops being sticky and the somewhat sketchy area. Lots of people sleeping on the sidewalks nearby. ",40,Mission Brewery,September 2019

The best part about the hike is that at the end of it, you reach a waterfall that's pretty cool. You can climb across the waterfall, but the issue is that apparently this is not a loop trail. A lot of the people from the other side said that they came from a completely different entrance to the hike than the Los Peñasquitos entrance. So we ended up taking a couple of pictures for the books and then turning back around the same way we came.

thereefs,Great walking on the coast - nice views.,"Had a very nice time walking around the reserve, not really a hike although there are a fair number of steps down to the beach.  I was concerned about parking, which I have found to be tough around San Diego.  At 10am on a Saturday there was no free public parking on the main road, and a few spaces in the reserve parking lots, which were obviously paid for in the entrance fee.  However, by the time we left around 2pm many people had left already and there was plenty of parking available inside the reserve.

We parked about a mile away since there was no room near the coast so with that, the hike up the hill, then the long loop to get to the beach, it was a few hours, almost 8 miles total, lots of stairs (not good for bad knees and hips). The plan was to get down to the beach but the high tide was in so couldn’t get to the beach safely. Wear sunscreen! Bring water! You’ll probably need a bottle refill from the water stations before walking back down and it’s warm-ish water. If you want cold water you’re out of luck unless you bring your own.

Teresa M,Amazing Urban Art Experience,"Designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016, beautiful murals cover otherwise drab concrete pillars under the Coronado Bridge.

MidtownEats,Frat row by the ocean,"Although there seems to be a smattering of decent-looking accommodations along Pacific Beach, the vibe (at least when we visited in late August) is decidedly spring-breaky. Mostly young adults renting the beachfront houses, playing loud music, engaging in drinking games at the bars, etc. So, if that’s your thing, you’ll probably like Pacific Beach. There’s also a pier for fishing and for watching the surfers.",20,Pacific Beach,August 2019

There is a long walk/bike trail above the beach, dividing the beach from many restaurants, hotels, and homes. You can rent bikes or get a scooter.  The ""main drag"" is Garnet, running West from the 5 freeway ending at the pier...which is a nice place to walk and get more views. Mission Blvd., the street running parallel to the ocean, is filled with eateries and shops also. You can go north to La Jolla or south to Mission Bay Park and the famous old roller coaster.

I highly suggest you YouTube the short documentary to understand what you are seeing.   This park is a testament to very determined and brave natives.

You have full view of the city skyline & the boats In the harbor, as well as the famous Coronado bridge. On a balmy summer night, it is heavenly. Add in the symphony and all your senses come alive. We watched the symphony accompany a big screen movie, La La Land, which appealed to all ages. They even shot off some fireworks at the end. So romantic! You can bring a picnic dinner, eat there, or visit one of the nearby restaurants. Season tickets are the Best Buy but you can buy individual tickets as well. Tip:  the bleacher seats don't come with a glass of champagne like the table seats but they are darn good. You can see & hear it all and they are comfortable individual seats with backs.

We bought tickets at the door for seats in the grand tier section. These are usually the best seats for sound and view, as they hangover the main floor towards the stage. However since there was no Orchestra I believe the sound was a little challenged for voice performances. Otherwise Patti Austin did an amazing job with Cole Porter tunes and Ella Fitzgerald renditions for wonderful wonderful night a great value",40,San Diego Symphony,November 2017
Joyce P,Beautiful Murals Under a Bridge,"This place is vibrant and full of beautiful art! The art work is prolific and so well done! I was so excited by its expansiveness-- there were so many painted pillars!  I practically ran from pillar to pillar just to see what came next. But then I slowed down and admired the color, the detail and the story they were telling. The powerful messages of self determination, pride, and liberty have stayed with me long after I left.  Bring a camera. Better yet, bring lunch and spend some time absorbing it all.",50,Chicano Park,October 2017
Sylvia5083,Proud Hispanic Pride,"Being a Mexican American from Texas, I was very happy to see this park full of historic and symbolic murals. We don't have anything like this in Houston!

Walker S,8 acres below the Coronado Bridge in Barrio Logan,"It contains the country's largest collection of outdoor murals in this immigrant community of central San Diego.  Chicano Park, like Berkeley's People's Park, was the result of a militant (but nonviolent) people's land takeover.  The takeover started on April 22, 1970 by two college students who spread the news that bulldozers were about to destroy the area designated by the city as a park.  By noon Mexican-American students walk out of schools to join the protest.

Although we didn't have tickets to get close to the orchestra, we were able to hear them play while we were in the park.

txtfa001,AMAZING Place,"I was at a conference and we went down to look at the murals after a session in the morning.  The murals are very reminiscent of those seen in Mexico and I was told that some of the artists traveled to Mexico to view murals.  However, these are not copies they are original and creative.  They have a website that you should view before you go if you are nfamiliar with the symbols and famous historic figures.  It is literally under the freeway and the bridge to Coronado.  It is also worth your time to read about the history of the park before you go.  It is also worth noting that the freeway bisected a once unified neighborhood which is sad.  It was nice to see what the local people have been able to do with this space.",50,Chicano Park,March 2016

Recently I went to the Scripps Institute campus that includes a pier and beach in addition to classrooms. The glorious sunset over the Pacific gave a vast and endless feel.  You can also experience a good sunset from the plaza adjacent to the US/Mexico Center, but beware of the raccoons that hang out here.  Throughout the campus you'll experience wonderful art from the talking tree near the library to the stone bear near the engineering area that also has a tipsy house atop one of the science buildings.

Programme included the West coast premiere of a composition by Judd Greenstein and it was an additional bonus to be able to chat with Mr Greenstein during the interval. Usually not a fan of ""modern"" music, but his ""Change"" composition was highly unusual and interesting to listen to.

We have a great symphony, and you will certainly enjoy hearing music you've heard bits and pieces of, but weren't sure where they came from.  Enjoy.

There are a set of preserved houses, old businesses, the first public school in the city, among other attractions. The oldest building in the city is from 1820 and is called Casa de Carrilo. The region developed around the first Spanish military fort, when the region did not even belong to the United States, as, as you know, California once belonged to Spain and Mexico. At the time it was called El Dorado because of the gold in it. So, to visit the Old Town is to travel a little in time and in a very nice way. There are more than 35 restaurants, many of them Mexican and, of course, very lively, 17 museums and dozens of small shops. Enjoy a nice outdoor stroll taking a few photos in front of the buildings and monuments there, try authentic California cuisine in the area's restaurants, or shop at the magnificent handicraft shops in your area. The fun there is more than guaranteed, so enjoy it.",40,Old Town San Diego State Historic Park,December 2018

Parts of it have eroded to the point where the trail is so narrow, slippery, and slopes towards the ravine, with no railing.  I myself have slipped and almost fell down the cliff, one hand grasping a little rock and hanging on for dear life.  Luckily two other hikers came by in time and pulled me up before my arm gave way.  I would not recommend this trail to anyone without the proper equipment.",20,Ho Chi Minh Trail,October 2017

Lola Elizabeth M,Major hike to the beach and lots of work to get back up!,"So, for this, you park on the residential street, and then walk to the trail.  It is steep and you need to wear proper shoes.  Going down is not so bad, but coming up, locals call it the 'push me, pull me trail' as in you might need to be pushed up and pulled up if you are not in good shape.  It is a major surfing beach and also you might see some nudists.  Many consider it to be a gay beach but if you are not gay, don't let that distract you.  In low tide, you can walk from here on the coast up to Del Mar.  There are no services of any kinds.  Just a really nice beach.  ",50,Ho Chi Minh Trail,January 2018

The concert hall is great and all the seats have a good view. The also have camera's roaming amongst the symphony and shown on TVs so you can watch as well. The drinks at the bar were expensive, but the cost goes towards the music so it's worth it. Parking inside the building is a bit tricky but there are plenty of paid lots near by. Highly recommend attending at Symphony Hall or the summer outdoors Pops.",40,San Diego Symphony,May 2014
SoCalMediaSurfer,"Wonderful Entertainment, Great Music, Ballet and More!","I attended most of the City Lights performances this season.  I was also so pleased at the Ballet performances for 2013/2014.  The San Diego Symphony is more than just classical music. There are great Ballet performances, concerts by well known artists, both for older and younger audiences.  The Hall is spectacular and I believe the best venue in San Diego for music.  The best seats in the house are actually the Grand Tier, just above the stage, you see better for dance and the sound of the symphony rises up to meet you.  If you have never been, GO, it is so worth it.  San Diego is proud to have such a great place to enjoy music, dance, and a history lesson or two of local stories.",50,San Diego Symphony,February 2014

Peacenquiet2013,Symphony Pops is a San Diego Summer Must-See,"For locals and visitors alike, the San Diego Symphony Summer Pops concerts are a unique opportunity to hear and see our symphony in a beautiful and casual setting. Ticket prices allow everyone to enjoy the event depending on the experience you want. Lawn seating is the most affordable and can be the most fun. Bring a picnic in a small cooler, some low back chairs, and a couple of blankets (it gets cool and breezy right on the water) and you get to see the symphony up close in your jeans and t-shirt. Get there by the time the doors open at 6 and you'll have a big selection of lawn area to choose from. Enjoy your pre-performance picnic (you may bring food and beverages, but no alcohol into the venue - you can purchase wine and beer at the event, if you choose) and then enjoy the show. There is also tableside seating for a slightly more formal feeling. Most shows offer fireworks after the concert which is the cherry on top of the concert. This is also a great way to expose your children to quality music.",50,San Diego Symphony,June 2014

It was early morning and there weren't many other people on the sand.  Later in the afternoon, we got out all of our gear and this is the beach we enjoyed for awhile.  Again, I looked for sea glass and found a lot!  With our 3 month old with us, we needed some shade and the coves and caves down at shell beach were perfect for that.  So unlike the east coast beaches, but nice with having an infant in tow.  We even got our feet in the water and it was cold, but fun!",50,Shell Beach Tide Pools,February 2018

There are a couple of guides in the courtroom and theatre that tell the history of the house.  There are also guides walking around  if you have any questions.  You can take all the pictures you like, they encourage people to take pictures.  But no video or audio recordings.  Beautifully restored home.  Informative guides.  Another haunted location checked off my paranormal bucket list.  I did take a lot of pictures. While looking over my pictures I did see something interesting....

The garage is so convenient to the theater once you get parked. If you arrive early enough, you can enjoy a drink or some pricey snacks outside before the show.

The museum might me more fun for kids 5 and under, but even then it might be disappointing. We did eat lunch at the museum, and it was fine, but if you plan to go, take your own lunch or eat somewhere else. The options are limited and NOT for picky eaters. The food would not appeal to kids under 10 and I was surprised my normally go-with-the-flow kids found something to eat there.

zombie1979,Great area!,"My wife and I went to Hillcrest the night of our marriage, we are a lesbian couple. Hillcrest is the place the go as there were a variety of things to do, shops, clubs, you name it. We ended up at Urban Mo's and had the time of our lives there. Not particularly a gay bar, but it was a great atmosphere and a variety of people just having fun.",50,Hillcrest,August 2013
b l,Great little neighborhood with eateries and shops to browse,"We took the trolley from our Chula Vista hotel and then the #3 bus here because we heard parking was hard to come by here, which is certainly true.  The # 11 also stops around the area of University and 5th Street.  They had all kinds of restaurants, Indian, Asian, and some more upscale dining.  We went into a bookstore and the Whole Foods.  We also decided to eat at Burger Lounge, which had grass fed beef.  The meal that we got was totally awesome.  We will certainly return!",50,Hillcrest,October 2013
randallblaum,"It is, to be frank - a dump.  Bad sound, bad sightlines, years of dust on the wall carpet and worse","This is just a place that is so far past it's prime it's not even funny.  I have wasted so much time and money seeing what should have been great productions only to walk away miserable and disappointed at the house.  Cramped lobby, old, dirty, not enough restrooms and then you add this to a lousy presentation inside the auditoria and what's the point.  I learned my lesson - this is not a theatre, opera, or music lovers venue. ",10,San Diego Civic Theatre,February 2016
Rebecca J,"So balcony level, is truly nose bleed.","Just went to see the Book of Mormon and had an amazing time, but it was difficult to hear some of the more ""hushed"" dialogue and the balcony is like no other balcony I have ever experienced. It is at such an intense angle that you feel dizzy. Not the greatest set up, also in a pretty bad part of town, not much to do around the area other than shop, but who likes that anyway? A very average theater indeed.",30,San Diego Civic Theatre,February 2016
Rodvalente,"Not Bad, Not Great ","Theater was OK. Saw Book of Mormon. I had tickets on my iPhone. When I got up to usher she could not scan it. Said, I had to go to the third line. Put a sign up! We are from DE and were not aware. Because of the crowds we were a few minutes late. They closed the doors and we could not go in until after the first song. If you can't accommodate the crowds coming in don't start the play. Poor service! No comparison to Philadelphia or NYC. Not impressed. ",30,San Diego Civic Theatre,March 2016

Fred B,Enjoyable Area,"Hillcrest was about 5 blocks from my bed and breakfast.  Nice area to check out.  Not a lot of shopping there and what was was on the expensive side.  But there were tons of restaurants featuring any type of food you might want. A Taste of Italy was exceptional.  I had lunch there and got a cup of soup and a 6"" sausage sandwich for $5.99.  Couldn't beat it.  Also found a Penzy's there which is a seasoning shop.  There's one in Michigan but was glad to find one there.  Bought 3 different seasonings.",30,Hillcrest,December 2013
Richard B,"Nice vibe,great city neighborhood","Hillcrest reminds me of Boystown  and Lakeview neighborhoods in Chicago, a little smaller with much much better winter weather. Diverse people, lots of shops and restaurants. Not far from downtown and just far enough from burbs. An easy 15 minute drive from most parts of inner San Diego. North park is very near, as are Mission Hills and Balboa park. Friendly. Parking is horrible....go 3 or 4 blocks west off of Robertson and you'll do better and probably for free. Wonderful Farmers market with 150+ vendors in the neighborhood. Eat here! Drink here. University and 5th would be a nice places to start. Buses go here,",50,Hillcrest,January 2014
Gil M,Overpriced--More for kids than adults,"We took a visiting German student to visit this place as something for her to experience.  We were happy that we received reduced prices as seniors.  We really loved the IMAX movie that we watched and that was worth going for, but you can't buy just the movie.  The exhibits that you can experience while you wait are very hands on and mildly interesting for adults.  I think the hands-on part would be very interesting for kids but not so much for adults. Recommended length of visit below would depend on whether you have kids or not.  The time recommended is for kids and includes seeing one of the movies.  For adults, I would recommend about half (unless you are very scientifically inclined).",30,Fleet Science Center,January 2017

jacquim883,Downmarket mall,"At first sight, Westfield Horton plaza looked innovative and attractive with its brightly coloured multi-level outdoor design. The mall was deserted until lunchtime, when people came to use the food court. Choices for food were limited to low quality fast food. The shops were empty except for Macy's which had a sale on. However, to get to it from Broadway, I had to cross the Horton Plaza which was home to many down and outs sleeping rough, talking to themselves or shouting at tourists. Apart from the spectacular Irving Gill water fountain and other water displays, there was little to cheer the visitor.",20,Westfield Horton Plaza,March 2017
HelenaGuerra,Young and vibrant area,This area is different from the rest of the city. It's very young and it has lots of people around. You will need less than 1h to visit it (not big).

Scott P,An eclectic part of the burg.,"Hillcrest has it's own following, it is a nice little corner of downtown with some great restaurants and shops.

Luann H,Have Broadway/San Diego Theater Tickets at this Venue.,"This is a nice place to see the musicals that are touring the country.  As a season ticket holder to Broadway San Diego, I have seen most of the  many of the wonderful musicals that are performed here.  If you are just thinking of getting tickets, make sure you get Orchestra Tickets, because they are the best seats to see these great Musicals. As for parking, just get there a little early and park on the street, it's easy to park and easy when it's time to leave.  A few restaurants within walking distance, so that makes it easy to go early, have dinner and get a good place to park.  Enjoy the Theater!",40,San Diego Civic Theatre,January 2015
RaptorMD,Excellent Theater Experience in San Diego,"My wife and I visited the San Diego theater for the first time last week.  We saw the award winning ""Pippin"".  Pippin was excellent, as the reviews proclaimed it would be.  We parked at the event parking garage next door for $10, which is very reasonable considering the some of the lots that line the streets charge up to $25.  Food ranging from lite meals to snacks such as cookies and caramel popcorn are available for purchase.  Beverage options range from a limited selection of beers, wines, and sodas to coffee.  We sat in the mezzanine section, which I believe is probably the best option due to the high level view and the acoustics of the theater.  The San Diego theater is very casual, I observed ladies and gentlemen wearing from nice kaki shorts and jeans with collared shirts to nice slacks and dresses.  This is a great starter theater if you want to try theater.  Season tickets and various plans are available at a cost savings if there are more than one shows that you want to see.  The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, several of them were senior citizens who were there more for their love of the theater than for a paycheck, overall it was a wonderful experience!",40,San Diego Civic Theatre,August 2015
Walker S,"Home to the San Diego Symphony, San Diego Opera, 3000 seats","Always an event to see at the Civic Theater, musicals such as Frozen, Grease, Mary Poppins, Phantom of the Opera and many others.

unhappytraveller123,Great way to spend a few hours or a day,"We heard praises of this Balboa Park museum,but testing it with our grandsons proved its worth.Starting with the IMAX, Under the Sea, the experience was amazng as the entire wall and ceiling becomes your screen( thanks Canadians for this invention)  for an hour and you see the Coral Triangle and the Great Barrier Reef, getting up close and personal with sharks and cuttle fish and seals. The changing exhibits are geared towards kids as well as excellent permanent ones. We loved The Tape Project as if you were climbing through the chambers of a human heart. All the buttons to push, pendulums to program, switches to manipulate are great fun for both kids and adults. If you live in San Diego, get a membership. Seeing the IMAX is worth every reasonable penny.",50,Fleet Science Center,August 2016
MeganG6457,Hmm,"There were some interesting science  exhibits but we were in and out of here within 30 minutes.  The kids found this place very entertaining and could have spent more time.

2travelersasof2001,Wicked was Awesome-Theater....Good,I had not been to this theater in a very long time.  I went with a friend in June to see Wicked and enjoyed myself so much that I purchased tickets again and went with my husband.  Did not enjoy the time with my husband as much because we had seats second to last row before the back wall on ground floor.  Thought this would be a nice area but the ushers kept talking and trying to seat late comers.  The sound also seemed to be off in this area.  Some of the show was hard to hear because the sound would bounce off the back wall.,40,San Diego Civic Theatre,July 2012
CAMom92082,Jekyll and Hyde,"Love the shows that come to the S.D. Civic Theatre. Jekyll and Hyde was just as I expected - a dark and scary story of good vs. evil. The two women leads were fantastic and Constantine Maroulis was superb as Jekyll / Hyde. The only negative would be the theatre itself. It is in total need of a make over!  It reminds me of an old, musty movie theatre with the carpet on the walls. We have been to many other theatres, such as Pantanges in LA, which are beautifully ornate. The S.D. Civic Theatre is dull and dreary. Hope they can refurbish it at some point.",40,San Diego Civic Theatre,October 2012

dlwintermia,A very good venue,"This is a tough one to rate.  It deserves four stars for many of its services and features.  However, seating is critical here.  The acoustics can be troublesome.  I won't and don't go unless I'm in the front or first several rows.  It is absolutely worth the money to purchase the best seat you can afford.  There are many very poor seats available and even if you think your safe, you find yourself in a seat that makes you want to get up and leave.  Enough said about that.  I do like the service in the theater, especially the upstairs bar where you can order your drinks for intermission in advance.  They are placed on your table just prior to the break.  Instantly you have a cocktail and conversation and you don't have to deal with lines.  I highly recommend this premium service.  The bartenders are also very accommodating.  I've never encountered anything but a smile and a prompt yes.  If you need air during intermission, there are always a couple of stations serving food and beverage.  I like the place very much, but seating is critical.",30,San Diego Civic Theatre,November 2012

There are some unique artistic features, a huge checkers board, two large chess boards, stores, restaurants, and a movie theater here.

pezdisney,Been to the house several times & never disappointed. Got ghostly pics too.,I'm really into ghostly stuff and this house is amazing. I found ghostly activity almost every time I've been here.  Bring your camera and take several pics in all the rooms.  Day time you can take your time and go through on your own pace and night time is a guided tour.  Oct is very busy so if you go at night add extra time.  Of course you can't always plan on a ghostly experience as they can't plan a ghost to appear at a specific time.  Be open minded and positive and then the spirits are more app to appear in a spirit orb and even full on apparition.  Tour guides are very knowledgeable and I especially like talking to Brett.  They dress in period costumes to add to the flare and the house is interesting in of itself too. They also offer actual ghost investigations monthly for the public to join in with San Diego Ghost Hunters that don't take a penny for their investigation as all monies paid go directly to the restoration and upkeep of the house.  Highly recommend going back often.,50,Whaley House Museum,October 2016

Crocusflower1,More suited to younger children.,We visited with our 12 and 14 year old.  We have been to many different science museums and this one was a little underwhelming.

There are rooms you cannot enter, but can view through glass.  I appreciated the historical handout that included information regarding the hauntings.

linda g,HIstoric  Home with an Interesting Story,"If you enjoy history and visiting historic homes, you will enjoy the Whaley House in Old Town, San Diego.  Built by a wealthy entrepreneur, the building's first floor housed a general store and the county courthouse.  The courthouse is set up in the museum as is a small store.  The family lived upstairs and then moved to the first floor when the grocery business moved out. For a few months, a theater group rented a portion of the second floor and the museum recreated an old time stage and auditorium in the room where it was. But the home's claim to fame is its reputation as one of the most ""haunted"" houses in the U.S.  Evidently, the land on which it is built was where the county gallows were located, but it is the family story from which the legend grew. One of the daughters married a scoundrel ignoring her parents' disapproval. After a short time, she realized her error, and her parents urged her to divorce her husband. She did and returned home but was very unhappy and took her life.  They say that she haunts the house to this day.  A cool way to get your older kids interested in history!  The docents are knowledgable and friendly. Check out the museum shop in the building next door!",40,Whaley House Museum,February 2017

pcbeaver,Don't waste your money! ,"Don't waste your almost $20 per person to visit this museum. We visited with our two children while on vacation and were looking for a fun indoor activity for our kids.  While this place has the potential to be great it is lacking. You walk into a large room with scattered science displays.  They all seem haphazardly placed and although there are many it only takes about 15 mins to do all of them.  The kids place area may be good for local mom's who buy an annual pass,  but not for visitors.  The infant area has blocks that are too large to be manipulated or explored by small children. It's basically just a small square with oversized blocks and nothing else.  The rest of the kids area could use a good refreshing. It all seems old and tired. We made the mistake of getting the all in one tickets to the museum that included an imax ticket. We were not told it was for family seating only.  Don't get the family ticket if you want to pick your seat.  We were told we could only sit at the very bottom so we could exit quickly if our kids needed to leave.  We wanted to sit higher up,  but were told those were for people who purchased tickets-we did purchase tickets! Also our children are accustomed to visiting imax shows and did not need to be quarantined to the kid area. Overall very disappointed, save your money for another attraction.

Richard K,Historic visit,"Interesting tour. The in-character guide will not only provide you with the history of what is said to be the most haunted house in America, but he will also try to interact with the ghosts that he claims to see.

christinestaszko,Here for the Haunts,"The tour is self guided and is finished in about 15-20 minutes, but I'd definitely do it again. It is a historical property that is fun to learn about and if you are already in Old Town its easy to pop by. The docents were very helpful and kind and since admission is not that expensive, stop by!",50,Whaley House Museum,April 2017
Libby243,Awesome.,"One of the most interesting places We have visited. The Gentleman on the door and the Lady in the shop made us feel most welcome. The Lady in the shop took so much time out to listen to us, advise us and tell us her story and was such a lovely person. The Lady , Pat, in the house was amazing, friendly, interesting and also a lovely person....I could have chatted and listened to her for ever and a day.

Can't wait to take my kids!",50,Whaley House Museum,April 2017
rhartoonians,Historic place ,We enjoyed our visit we had a family visit with the 10 years old daughter and we all enjoyed historic state of building we went in the morning tour  but we heard the evening's tours are much better  specialty for couples or families with teenagers . We recommend this place for family visits. You might have a short visit but it's enjoyable.,50,Whaley House Museum,April 2017
cnc123,Overrated,"I was looking forward to visiting this mall on a recent family trip to San Diego after seeing many mentions on Pinterest.  This mall has seen better days, And felt run down with many closed stores.  Not worth the $10 to park.",20,Westfield Horton Plaza,November 2016
Escape-overseas,Shopping in the centre of the city,"A shopping mall with a quirky Art Deco design. Lots of the usual  shops, similar to other malls, although a little smaller, despite being located over 4 floors. Lots of parking available, and with a food court on the upper level. No visit to San Diego would be complete without a trip around the mall, if only to view the sights.",50,Westfield Horton Plaza,December 2016
ist389,Not terrible,"It isn't really living anymore. It was really empty when I got there. Some sellers are making a talk and don't let you go, that is annoying. Lots of stores are vacant. The stores that are there are okay.",30,Westfield Horton Plaza,December 2016

Walt S,Not what you'd think,"It's been a long time since I visited this museum and it has definitely changed for the worse. It amounts to 3 eating areas with a couple souvenir sales locations, and a small area that offers a somewhat antiquated series of ""science things"". It does have the Imax but it really does not have much more to offer. Even the kids that were there running around seemed bored with what was supposed to be an ""educational""  experience. In my estimation definitely not worth the large expense of admission.",20,Fleet Science Center,November 2016
MeNMiSelf,$20 for an IMAX Film and Worn Out Broken Down Kids Displays,"Having been to many science museums/exhibits in many N. American cities, this is one of the worst.  Now, if it was JUST for kids, it would still be a waste, as many of the displays are broken.  It is run-down and just so very small and so sad.  As adults, you pay $20 for an IMAX movie.  They are open 365 days a year but do they take advantage of that!  Such crappy, broken, run-down displays that you can see in ten minutes and then there is an IMAK show which is not presented well, as it is too close to the screen/dome so you area always looking around.  It's OK. but nit very good.  Very expensive for what they have.  Sadly the displays are worn out and old.  Shame.",20,Fleet Science Center,November 2016

Laura P,10:30pm Ghost Tour,One of the better Ghost tours I have been on and would highly recommend visiting if you are curious about the paranormal.  I would not recommend this tour for young children under the age of 16 as I feel it might be too scary.  The tour was well worth the money I paid and the tour guides were all helpful and well informed.  I did get some good photo's but didn't see any ghosts.  The house was truly amazing.,50,Whaley House Museum,June 2017

toddone1,Pretty good open-air shopping mall - but missing something,"This is a good gateway into parking and walking around the Gaslamp Quarter though I do not know if it is worth it as a destination in itself. The outdoor shopping with multiple levels lends a nice ambiance, and there is plenty of shopping, though the stores are mostly typical mall-fare. Ended up being pretty disappointed in the place overall, it was pretty dead, and several stores were closed which kind of gave it a boring vibe. I would search for better places to shop or even walk around - as I said earlier - great place to park and walk the Gaslamp Quarter to shop, dine, or people watch, but not a great destination in itself.",30,Westfield Horton Plaza,April 2017
krystalr263,Ok but not really worth the price-except for the movie,"The IMAX movie was the best part of the museum for us. It was amazing. If we ever go back, we'll probably just go to 2 movies and skip the rest of the museum. ",30,Fleet Science Center,March 2017

That happened to us, and the place was packed.  Had to wait a few minutes to get into the play area for kids 5 and under.  Lots of hands on exhibits that our son enjoyed.  Also really liked the IMAX movie on engineering.  Museum is worth another visit, when it is less crowded.",40,Fleet Science Center,April 2017
scott r,"meh - the ghost story isn't all that good, the house is rather so-so as well","Don't really believe, so wasn't looking for ghosts - but there isn't anything particularly compelling about this haunting anyway.  Do like historic buildings and as far as this one went, the docent explanations weren't all that clear and this is mostly self-guided - which is fine, if there is enough signage to explain what one's looking at.  As it is, you can fill in the blanks, but really, it barely scrapes the price of admission.  (Sorry)",30,Whaley House Museum,October 2017
yajairacastrejon,The Whaley House,"Before you walk into the Whaley house you must first head over to the Whaley House Museum to purchase your ticket into the Whaley House. Upon entering the Whaley House you are greeted by two ladies who five you a brief story of the house and hand you a self guided tour sheet. The tour begins in the courtroom, a room full with chairs and and a judges bench. The next room you enter is the Whaley General Store which displays items that Thomas Whaley used to sell such as tobacco cigarettes, inkwells and fountain pens, and even spirits and liquor. In this room there is a cabinet display of some of the members of the Whaley family and they're personal belongings. Items such as China, shoes, books and even a small handgun are displayed here. The next room you enter is the dining room which an 1860's theme dining room with chairs covered in woven horsehair and a small stove oven on the opposite end of the dining table. The kitchen has common kitchen items of the era such as a straw broom, cinnamon sticks, a butter churner. After the kitchen the instructions on the tour sheet say to proceed upstairs onto First Commercial Theatre in San Diego. The theatre has individual seats, wooden chairs, and a stage which was decorated with a christmas tree due to the upcoming holidays. After the theatre is Thomas and Anna Whaley's master bedroom which consists of a bed with handwoven sheets, a sewing machine, and small fireplace.Across the master bedroom is the children bedroom which has common toys of the era and the family crib which was used by four generations of Whaley's. As you make your way downstairs you make your way to the guest bedroom, which connects to Thomas Whaley's study and and the Parlor. Overall the tour is really entertaining and you can take your time observing everything. It really takes you back to the era of an 1860's home. Although the place is known for being haunted, above all its known for being a historic site.",50,Whaley House Museum,December 2017

T9194LCjuliag,So sad how far this downtown mall has fallen,"I used to love this mall.  It had a Nordstrom and many restaurants and shops.  It's now a virtual ghost town.  Nordstrom closed and now Macy's is the only large store to remain.  Most of the nation wide chains have left.  It's now filled with off brand, limited selection shops and closed store fronts.  There is a Jimbo's supermarket.  The last time I visited, I was aggressively approached by a woman who screamed at me and demanded money.  There were also scary looking people in the stairwell in the parking garage.  This mall needs to be closed and renovated.  Parking is free for the first hour unless you get it validated at Macy's where you can get three hours.",10,Westfield Horton Plaza,June 2017

jamu421,This mall has gone way down hill,We used to come visit this mall for years and this USED TO BE lovely. It has been a few years since we were last here and we were so disappointed at how derelict this plaza has become.  We won't be back.  It was so dirty at the food court we couldn't believe it.  So many stores are closed now...it's really gone down hill.,10,Westfield Horton Plaza,July 2017
NormLWat,Not worth the stop,"Disappointed in the plaza.  It is laid out over several blocks with various levels which are confusing and difficult to navigate.  At one time it may have been a shopping destination however, there are now more vacancies then stores to shop in.  Stores that are still there, are spread out and on different levels which adds to the frustration of walking the mall.  The Macy's was also disappointing, not the normal selection or tidiness that you would expect.  Unfortunate as this is a central location that could be quite the destination.",20,Westfield Horton Plaza,May 2017
oliveiror2017,Tired mall with a few stores for quick stop,The Westfield mall appears to be a spot for minor convenience. I don't think most residents and visitors really come to the Gaslamp area to shop. It could be a visit to purchase an essential item such as a Banana Republic or Gap shirt / jeans or a visit to Macy's. there is a large gym at the ground level and a few stores with random offerings such as baby wear or massage parlours or hairdressers. There is a food court too but I avoided it. ,30,Westfield Horton Plaza,July 2017

We were only going to do a quick visit because the kids were tired from zoo but stayed longer than we planned. IMAX movie included and saw one About the national parks which was good. Then we hit the exhibits. The video game exhibit looked good but most of the good games were squatted by people so didn't get to try a lot out ourselves. Upstairs was the regular exhibits and they had a lot of interesting ones that were cool. Definitely worth your time to visit if in balboa park and near the zoo.

Alison52,Disappointed,"Had heard quite a lot about the Whaley House but were disappointed. Unlike most of OT's other attractions, the Whaley House charges a fee ($8) even for a self guided tour. Fair enough if there was a lot to see but there isn't. Its a relatively small building and whilst its furnished with antiques, few, if any of these are original to the house and most have to be viewed behind glass or ropes. I suppose I'd been expecting something more akin to the Winchester House of Mystery, which it certainly isn't. If you're in Old Town, much better experiences can be had for free at the Seeley Stable and the Mormon Battalion museum.",20,Whaley House Museum,February 2018

We both had a flight of four beers. ",50,Modern Times Beer,December 2015

traveltrixie,Unique taproom,"Check out the ultra hip taproom while you try the good beers. They also serve coffee if that's more your style.

merlot1234,Don't waste your time,"Overpriced and touristy.  They used to validate parking but no more.  I was there last week 45 minutes and had to pay $6 for parking.  I was here in San Diego when it opened in 1985 to revitalize downtown shopping with a mall in a condensed space. It was touted for its architecture and wild colors and designs, but what I never liked since the day it opened was that you are in a maze.  You are the white rat trying to find your way around because one side is a half level higher than the other, you need to find a bridge to cross over, and that some escalators go only one way (one going down without its mate going up).  When it first opened it had good stores, since the Convention Center opened it has shifted to tourist trade. Drive to one of the malls in Mission Valley instead.",10,Westfield Horton Plaza,October 2017
Pomerols,Mediocre shopping...,"Very mediocre shopping... a few stores with so-so merchandise and a layout that is very confusing.  The plaza has several floors and levels but not a lot of indications as to which floor is which.  I had to use the location of the store I was standing close to on the mall map to know which floor I was on.  There are not enough stairs to move from one level to the next.  It was probably conceived to make the shopper walk pass more stores and browse.  Unfortunately, a lot of shops being closed, it give the mall a shabby atmosphere instead.",20,Westfield Horton Plaza,October 2017

Parking fee is $2 per 20 minutes and few shops are open, Macy's being the only major anchor.  We have no idea what the parking cost was because the machine never gave us a receipt; we waited 5 minutes to process the ticket and finally gave up after we called someone and were told to go to our car and exit.",10,Westfield Horton Plaza,October 2017

Sadly, it has declined in the last few years, The loss of a major department store, shop and restaurant closings, and a few unfortunate deaths have pushed the space into a seemingly tailspin.

Maybe not for everyone but if you have an appreciation for antiquities and history this was very enjoyable.",50,Whaley House Museum,April 2018
dlg127,Save your money and time.,"The most haunted house in America?  I don't think so. Our tour guide, though extremely nice and dressed in period costume, lacked the necessary storytelling skills to make a tour of this sort interesting. Bless his heart, he kept repeating himself and a lot of the ""hauntedness"" relied on account from fellow visitors of a ""feeling a hand"" touch them, or a ""dog barking"" during a tour.  It is somewhat interesting from a historical point of view, but a lot of what was in there were reproductions rather than original to the home.  I would say, save your money read the history online, and do something more interesting with your time and money.  Oh, and our guide said that our phones would mysteriously lose battery power once we stepped inside.  Not one of the 4 of us lost a single percent, nor did any ghostly apparitions appear on any of our pictures.

At least 16 taps pour a wide selection of fruit beer, to IPAs to Stouts – lots in between.  The Fruitland’s was a Passion Fruit and Guava infused treat.  Oneida was a very crisp and clean Pale Ale. The Shoulder of Orion was a wonderful collaboration with Fair State Brewing Cooperative and showed what talents the talented Brew meisters possess.  City of the Dead was a nitro charged coffee barrel aged stout – Wow – bursting with flavors. …and the Black House was another well done stout with coffee beans roasted by Modern Times.

Really imaginative interior, a hardworking and friendly staff and of course good beer.  They have just upgraded, adding a cafe inside as well as a merchandise shack.

Won't have to deal with traffic or parking and especially won't have to deal with a DUI!",50,Modern Times Beer,August 2016

I like the mix of the old and the modern style in their beer and in their venue!",40,Modern Times Beer,February 2016
Patbow,What an interesting museum!!,"When I was visiting, there was a special exhibit on the history of cannibalism. Yes, I thought that sounded strange but it was very enlightening; cannibalism isn't all that you think! What is funny is at the end of the exhibit, there is a giant 'operation' game, just like I had as a kid, and you can remove the 'parts' with tongs. Each body part comes with the name and number of calories! EEK!",50,San Diego Museum of Man,May 2018
Angelina N,What happened to the museum of man,Disappointed San Diegan,10,San Diego Museum of Man,June 2018
IaMNeverL8,Underwhelming exhibit,"The current special exhibit ""Cannibals:Myth & Reality"" was a major disappointment.There were very few historical items on display and the main thrust seemed to be that indigenous people have been given a bad rap in history and that it was really the Europeans who make up most of the flesh eaters. I saw the previous ""torture exhibit"" and it was well worth the price with many, many historical artifacts. You can't buy a separate admission to the exhibit. You have to buy an admission which includes entry to the Museum of Man as well.If you don't want to go the Museum of Man and just want to see the Cannibal exhibit, it's not worth the price.   If this sort of thing is your cup of tea and if they would sell a separate admission to the exhibit I would say it is worth no more than five dollars. Even if you are the type of person who likes to read every placard and check out every display, you can easily see the complete exhibit in 30 to 45 minutes.",10,San Diego Museum of Man,July 2018
Bear H,The cannibal  Exhibit is the bomb,The museum has small exhibit spaces and a tower visit where you can see most of the San Diego area.  Tower costs extra.  The best part of this visit was the cannibal exhibit which was a spiral show.  Takes about 90 minutes to do it well.  Kids love it and it is most interesting,40,San Diego Museum of Man,July 2018

GeorgeH-LI_NY-ExPat,Beautiful & Unique Shaped Mall,"A very unique mall with many stores on five different levels arranged around a large open air courtyard. While each level has its own interior walkway, some of the walkways do not form a complete circle, but just dead-end, so you have to go back to a large store, and go up or down to the next level & then out to that level's walkway. There are several large anchor stores, such as Macy's & many smaller specialty shops, along with several restaurants & fast food choices. We really enjoyed shopping in this mall and it was also very close to a transit system station, where we were able to catch the subway/train/trolley back to our tour bus.",50,Westfield Horton Plaza,August 2017

Cal F,Beautiful Campus,It's honestly one of the nicest campuses in the country. They have great facilities and the education is great as well. All the student are very friendly and it's easy to ask questions and have conversations with them as well. The architecture is very nice and has a Spanish castle feel to it. It's also located in a great location in Mission Bay not to far from the beach. It's a really gorgeous campus.,50,University of San Diego USD,November 2014
Kiddo67,Hidden San Diego Gem,"Situated atop a promontory over-looking San Diego Bay sits the stunning campus of the University of San Diego.  The site offers a respite from the usual tourist fare and rivals Balboa Park with its collection of Spanish Rennaissance buildings.  Stroll through the campus and marvel at its pristine cleaniliness (this is a campus after all!!) and its many intimate and immaculate gardens.  Peer through the doors of the buildings to admire the stunning architural details, sit in one of the many gardens with fountains and even an brilliant blue infinity pool, and end up at the edge of the promontory where you can admire the views stretching from Point Loma to La Jolla.  This is probably the best view in the whole city.  At the end of your tour, relax in the newly opened and upscale Gran Terraza dining room with views over the Tecolote canyon.  We enjoyed every minute of our half-day visit.",50,University of San Diego USD,December 2014
Debbie K,One of the Most Beautiful Campuses I Have Visited,"I have been on more than a hundred campuses worldwide and this one ranks as one of the top two in terms of aesthetic beauty. The picturesque location atop a mesa known as Alcalá Park overlooks Mission Bay and the north side of San Diego. The vistas from the various parts of campus are lovely. We went into the Shipley Science Center which provided terrific views from the rear balcony. However, the preeminent feature that is so striking is the architecture. The white buildings constructed in a style reminiscent of Spanish architecture are especially striking at night when they are beautifully lit. Taking a stroll up the pedestrian mall after dark to better appreciate this is a must. Overall, this is a campus well worth seeing if you are in the area. It will be a memorable visit.",50,University of San Diego USD,December 2014

We didn't catch any ghosts, but we did learn a lot of history and learn about the way things used to be. Put it on your must do list. When I go back I'll be ghost tour at night!

There was also a good exhibit on beer through the ages and cultures, and indigenous art local to the area.",50,San Diego Museum of Man,January 2018
allbeers,Pass it by.,Displays and exhibits were extremely simplistic and lacked timely information which was quite noticeable to the most novice of museum visitors.

Kristin T,Not worth the ticket price,"The ticket is pricey for what is offered - the exhibits are minimal and not as developed as most museums.

There were many interesting aspects in the history of man museum (race, human evolution, different cultures, mummies, and serveral others) and the tower tour was particularly nice.  There were many steps to climb, but there were several floors to rest, so the climb was not too bad.  The tower view was beautiful.  The cannibal exhibit was particularly interesting (although perhaps not for everyone).  I specifically wanted to visit the Museum of Man (Balboa Park has many different museums and other sights), and I was not disappointed.",40,San Diego Museum of Man,November 2017
Dmarkwind,Interesting anthropology museum,"We also opted for tickets to the separate Cannibals: Myth & Reality exhibit, which was located across the street from the main museum.  The exhibit was larger than any of those across the street, and listed various pieces of literature and films featuring references to cannibals, but also explained that calling someone a cannibal is a way to deny both their humanity and their rights. From stories of Christian soldiers during the Crusades eating their enemies, to Aztec ritual sacrifices, to New Zealand Maori allegedly devouring members’ of Captain Cook’s crew,  to the 1961 disappearance of Michael Rockefeller in New Guinea, to folks who resorted to cannibalism after being stranded atop the Andes Mountains in the 1970s after a plane crash, there were a lot of examples. My favorite part of the exhibit was the life-size “Operation” game where you extracted rubber versions of life-sized human organs, and there was nutrition information on the back of each. You also got a button for the exhibit as you left.",40,San Diego Museum of Man,December 2017

We picked our favorite museum to visit, the Museum of Man. There is something to pique the interest of every age group. One exhibit opened our memories to our previous visits to the Mayan ruins. Another exhibit showed the history of beermaking and how it has developed the craft brewing business in California. We had seen the exhibit on Race  in a previous location of its tour, but it was worth a second look. Unfortunately it was not well attended when we were there. Most people were at the Monsters exhibit or the Man and Animals exhibit. You can buy a base ticket and add extensions to the exhibit on cannibalism and a tour of the recently reopened tower which had been closed for the past 80 years. Plan on  a couple of hours for the basic entry.",50,San Diego Museum of Man,January 2018

LuckyBobAZ,Founders Chapel - Stunning white campus on the hill,"Hard to find without a map or navigation system.  We were invited to a wedding at Founder's Chapel at USD.  Having seen the stunning white campus buildings up on the hill from the 8 Freeway, it looked very easy to get to.  Not so!  When we finally found the correct road to take us up the hill to the chapel, we couldn't figure out which building we were supposed to be in for the wedding.  We had been told not the building with the blue domed roof.  We were told to park on Marian Way.  That was under construction.  We ended up next to the blue domed building, unsure of which building was the Founders Chapel as the sign outside on the wall said Sacred Heart Chapel.  It was all walled off from Alcala Park Way, but we found an opening and walked down the steps.  The nearest open door led us through the nave.  We almost walked into the front of the chapel.  Thankfully the priest stopped us and directed us down a narrow hallway to the main entrance.  Once inside, however, the chapel was beautiful.  The priest was wonderful.

Of the three, only the tower tour was worth doing.  The museum itself was not only boring but could not have been more left wing if it tried. The Race exhibit and the Animal exhibit were designed to make you feel guilty and the rest of the exhibits were just plain boring. The cannibal exhibit was ok at best but was rather short and not sure how they justify an additional $7 per person to see it. Overall a gigantic waste of time.

Tonya C,A Nice Historic House,"I have to admit, I was not too familiar with the story of the Whaley House until I started planning my trip to San Diego.  I learned that it was one of the most haunted houses in America.  It cost $10 and it’s a self-guided tour but you are given a sheet of paper that kind of guides you through the house (tells you about each room).  Although the directions were pretty clear, I think I went out of sequence but I just wanted to explore.  You really can’t walk into most of the rooms because they have glass barricades, which I guess makes sense because there’s really no one there to stop you from taking any of the items in the room.  However, if you’re trying to take photos to catch an apparition, you’re likely to just capture a reflection instead.  There was a woman in the theater upstairs dressed in a Victorian dress and she told a few stories about the house.  She was very knowledgeable and it was my favorite part of the tour.

While the day tours are self guided, as we were there on a Tuesday around 11am, we basically had the house to ourselves and after asking the docent a plethora of questions, she basically gave us a tour of the whole house.  The history of the house and  the entrepreneurial bent of Mr Whaley (ie the house was used for so many things - general store, court house, live theater) was really interesting and of course you throw in the ""haunted"" aspect of  the  house, the story gets even better. Docent did relate some of her own haunted experiences a she has been giving tours for over a decade.  Her theory as why so many of the family members remain had to do with early and tragic demise of daughter Violet!  Overall don't need to spend more than an hour (less if you don't engage with the  docent) but  interesting local history.",40,Whaley House Museum,February 2019

In the years the major department stores have left as have most upscale specialty stores.  Jimbo's, a health food grocery store opened a few years ago and is the only really nice place to shop for groceries. There are tattoo parlors, downscale stores and lots of empty spaces.

MatthewL1978,Enjoyable early morning hike,Decided to hike Cowles Mountain this morning.  After reading a few reviews I decided to hike the eastern side which is much less crowded.  The entrance was on Barker Way and there are two paths you can choose.  I chose the Cowles Mountain Service Road.  This is very steep in places and definitely puts your thighs through a workout on the way up.  The summit is pretty and has some different signs to read.  On the way down I chose to follow the Cowles Mountain Trail and then take the Barker Way Trail.  This brought me in a complete circle back to where I started.  The trail on the descent was much narrower and not clearly marked in a few spots.  All together this was a great hike.,40,Cowles Mountain,March 2017
Mark_Rondeau_USA,Expect Crowds & Other Dogs,"Bathroom facilities at the base with running water.  Lots of tourists, children, and dogs on the trail.  Well maintained.

snookie57,Vacation,"Enjoyed the museum. It had a monster section for kids where kids could play. On the first floor there were huge Mayan stone carvings and the tools they used to do the carvings with. Upstairs or take elevator was about Race and the mans ancestors which was cool. There was Egyptian sarcophagus, mummies and bowls etc. across the way is a kids play area that looks like fun. There is a computer, hats and digging tools to pretend your finding things . There is a section on beerology where fermented grains were made for ceremony, libation , socializing , or used for trade. All of this was interesting. We paid extra to visit across the street to hear and read about cannibalism . Totally somber feelings but learned a lot. They even have a giant operation game where you try to get pieces out with out hitting the sides which are metal that buzzes and a light goes on.it is similar to the kids game operation. I think it was worth seeing. To lighten your mood on exit you get one pen to put on your clothes that has a saying on it. Enjoy!",40,San Diego Museum of Man,June 2017
volcanogirl,Beautiful Architecture and Interesting Exhibits,"We came to the Museum of Man because we were interested in climbing the tower, and you can only access it through the museum building. We were pleasantly surprised by the exhibits we found inside - the one on race was particularly interesting. It talked about the origins and development of man, DNA, how people perceive themselves, etc. There was also one on ancient cultures and their consumption of beer; that one included some ancient growlers that were fun to see. For a small extra fee, you could also tour their cannibalism exhibit, and we enjoyed that one too. At the end they gave us each a witty button as a fun little giveaway. There are other exhibits that are more appropriate for children - a monster section, a section on pets, etc., as well as some areas with ancient Mayan and Egyptian artifacts. The museum itself has beautiful Spanish architecture with incredible detail, and the view from the top is gorgeous and worth the extra fee they charge. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and we were happy that we came.",40,San Diego Museum of Man,April 2017
GlobalGypsy_13,Old but trendy,"This traditional museum in architecture and cabinet of curiousity cases has touches of the modern.  Currently, both the Monster and Beer exhibits are well worth seeing as they both give a historical and/or global context to these 2 topics.  However, other parts of the museum and exhibits are dated.  The iconic tower that looms over Balboa Park is now open for tours at an additional price.  There is a small gift shop in the entry room.

This was not easy at all. Very high up..1500 feet. I was exhausted at the end! Not long to walk up... about one hour... down was steep too and I was afraid to slide or twist my ankle.

To make it really worth your while, hike the back side. The trail head is at the end of Big Rock Road off of Mission Gorge Road in Santee. Compared to the popular trail up the other (Lake Murray) side of the mountain, it's uncrowded and feels more like wilderness. The view from the top is worth the panting and sweating.

The Pause Play exhibit {currently featured, interactive big kid kinda things} was overly crowded but did have some neat things. We had the Go Card, so I didn’t feel too bad being there.

The hike up is nothing too special. There's not a ton of pretty views while you're hiking up, but getting to the summit is worth it. Bring lots of water and some sunscreen.

lhs624PA,Very hands on but very crowded,My two kids (12 and 9) really seemed to like this place but the crowds made it hard to focus on things and it was sensory overload.  We got there about an hour after opening time so that was our first mistake. Should have gotten there right when it opened but we had spent the morning at the aquarium.   We were able to get our hand stamped to leave the museum to get lunch in the main square of Balboa Park (happened to be a food truck festival the week we were visiting) which made for a nice break before returning for the IMAX movie which was really good (Great Barrier Reef),40,Fleet Science Center,April 2019

When we went back to the room that night I played it literally 100xs frame by frame.. 1st we see a moving mist in the courtroom. I went frame by frame and I kid you not, at least 4 faces. I couldn’t sleep the last couple nights. Weak right? Hah. I just feel like we caught something worth looking into. There’s clearly something there. We took pics outside of the trees and when I replayed the Live Photo it glitched in every tree photo, not in any other of my photos.. just of the trees. I also listened to the audio when I was doing Live Photo inside the house and caught creepy noises. I don’t know how to really edit pics but I’m gonna post them anyways. The one with the circle and arrows all around it is a face of a man with a mustache, he’s sideways. Another one is in between posts and has a weird face and there’s another face by it. I had to zoom in and brighten the pics so it looks a little crappy. I wish I could post all of my findings but there’s just to much.

While i was able to place an order fairly quickly the couple next to me struggled for about 20 minutes. One of them got up and got in the beer line but after 10 minutes ran back to his seat when his female companion started to order. I requested 3 tasters - Dealers choice after I described what i liked and wasn't disappointed.  I ended up getting 3 more tasters after perusing the menu but the first 3 were my favorite.

After Cowled mountain, you can walk further to the other peak which is about 30-40mins hike away.  Highly recommend for a short morning exercise!",40,Cowles Mountain,January 2015

hikingbug0116,Great view of East county ,This is a great place to hike. It is enough of a workout that it doesn't kill you and is doable with kids and families. The last time I was here there was the San Diego fire department running the mountain in full gear so that was a cool site. Once at the top you have a great view of east county and part of SD. But don't forget to touch the rock/ stone sign at the top of the hill or the hike doesn't count ,50,Cowles Mountain,October 2014
MarineAir10,A Great Mall,Something for everyone’s.  This is a downtown mall that goes ‘up’ and not out.  A wide variety of shops can be found on the different floors and we did some neat shopping.  The food court on the top floor offers a wide variety that pleased everyone in our group for lunch and had selections normally not found in a mall.,50,Westfield Horton Plaza,April 2019

At the peaks of each trails, some beautiful views of areas.  I would suggest to bring lots of water, however there were no restrooms on the trails that we hiked.  We started at the Barker trailhead.  This site had limited parking, if it is busy, you will have to park a distance from the trail start.  The trails that we hiked were marked adequately with signage, and there were trail maps at the trailhead.  You could spend a couple of days hiking all of the trails at this park.

It is a very very well used trail, which causes it to be somewhat slippery with the finely ground dust.

PsychRN12,A Much Better Experience,"I visited here several years ago and was disappointed. This time around was much more different. They have obviously renovated and remodelled the center and added new exhibits. There was lots to see and do, including many hands-on exhibits that are fun even for adults.

Karen T,Beautiful Place,I had an afternoon to kill in San Diego so I decided to visit old town.  While there I came across the Whaley House.  I had heard this was one of the most haunted places in the US so I was curious to see if I could experience anything.  Well the dining room is beyond creepy.  It has a very negative presence.  I also picked up an herbal smell in that room.  A docent told me they don't use any air fresheners and that I wasn't the first to comment on an herbal smell.  Upstairs I picked up a strong male presence in the master bedroom and a female presence in the back bedroom which I was told was Violets.  All and all it was an interesting visit.  I enjoyed talking to the docents.,50,Whaley House Museum,September 2019

Our visit started off strong with a large exhibit on Canabills (kind of odd but we went with it), but as soon as we moved onto the main museum we were underwhelmed.  All it is, is a large open area with small exhibits.  Took us about 15 mins to go through.  Not recommend with children.  ",30,San Diego Museum of Man,August 2019
simiseeu,The cannibal exhibit was the highlight,"The admission price has been reduced during the construction taking place.

Such a Gas-lamp icon, now gone! We were told that the owners waited for all the leases to expire and will re-vamp it, somehow. I was expecting it to be leveled and more high-rise condos built. Hopefully, not! It was just creepy walking thru the multi-level, once thriving mall, now eerily quiet and unoccupied.

Lynne0725,Demise of Another Mall,I was in the Gas Lamp District and saw the Macy's and decided to stop by. The parking lot across the street was extremely expensive--something like $2 for every 6 minutes. Anyway we left through one of he rear exits of Macy's and discovered the mall is pretty much deserted. It was kind of creepy so we didn't linger to see if other stores remained open. This is a shame.

SPN21,In the middle of a vibrant area in downtown San Diego,"Lots of attractions and things to do all around this large, interesting structure. A terrific Macys store anchors what should be the beating heart of the Gaslamp Quarter.  We spent time and money there.  But there is a need for more 'experiential', themed businesses like the theater, Jimbos Natural food store, the juice places and the 24 Hour Fitness center which is a large well run and clean operation with a stream of patrons. Security is in evidence especially at night so why shouldn't there be more entertainment venues in this place? It sits in the midst of a part of town that has many such businesses that appear to be doing well.  We have gone there two or three times already and plan to go back to shop Jimbos.   This is a good spot for health related businesses like The Joint or fun oriented Dave & Busters, etc., etc.  Would love to see it develop under modern management.

Hidden in a little alcove is a drop dead gorgeous brass statue of what appears to be Kwan Yin, the Chinese Goddess of Compassion.  This was a highlight for me.  The constant sound of running water and strolling through the gardens at your own pace is very relaxing and meditative, a beautiful way to spend an hour or so.  Don't miss it.",50,Japanese Friendship Garden,April 2019
cpyourprofessor,cozy little park,Came here to see the cherry blossom trees in bloom... did not disappoint... they were beautiful. The Koi pond was nice as well.

GlobalGypsy_13,What a Gem!,"The Timken Museum of Art is NOT a hidden gem at Balboa Park as it's located at the heart of the park across from the Visitor's Center.

eblocker4460,Nice Display ,We enjoyed this display of various artists of Russian Orthodox tradition of scenes of the life of Christ. Those by Rembrandt were also very enjoyable. In the other galleries were paintings in the French Romantic period and others by famous artists that were all very enjoyable. We were happy to find this gallery to be free of charge. We recommend this gallery if you're in the area.,40,Timken Museum of Art,April 2018

pedz55,Uniquely California,Coming from New York where we have our share of farmers' markets we really enjoyed this one.  It has a California feel to it with more health related stands and lots of other interesting food and flowers.  We got a nice souvenir here and got a good initial impression of San Diego as it was the first thing we did.,50,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,August 2017

ellenbee56,beautiful garden on multiple levels,"We visited here at the end of December as part of our day exploring Balboa Park. We had free admission as AHS members. Before we entered the garden, we noticed the lovely view down into the lower garden, which can be seen from the road. Once we began our stroll, we saw that much of the garden is down in the valley and required a fairly long walk down a winding path. We could see that the long walk back up that incline would be too difficult for me, so we did not go down to the lower garden. The view was beautiful, but the terrain was rough. I am glad we did not pay admission, since we did not stay there long afterall. If you are up for a bit of a steep walk (both downhill and uphill), you will enjoy this garden; otherwise, enjoy the view from the road and save your money.",30,Japanese Friendship Garden,December 2018

We always love to spend time with the Russian icons in one of the galleries; these are rotated.  The current (Nov. 2017) Monet exhibit is small but quite good. The docents are proactive and a tiny lobby gift shop with a good selection was added in 2017.",50,Timken Museum of Art,November 2017

Rastafa_Targaryen,Good family activity,What I liked about the market was that most stands took credit card. I had the uni poke from the market. It was delicious but it was $17.

Don't forget to bring a few shopping bags and cash... most of the market operates on a cash basis.",50,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,October 2017
lauracS9347XB,Museum That is Worth a Visit,"This museum is not fancy.  The write ups on the Marines who have served their country and have been given medals by our country was inspiring, however.  A lot of men have given their all to serve their country and preserve our way of life.  Just visiting this museum and being aware of their sacrifices is important.  They also have a field full of different jets, jet fighters and helicopters.  You can see close up how it would be to fly one of these machines and what it might be like to have to make the decision to 'eject' if you run into trouble. This museum only takes donations.",30,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,September 2016

A place to walk and see the amazing colors,  flowers and enjoy the atmosphere.  The park is huge and you can't see it all in one day. But make sure you go see and visit this place.

GlobalGypsy_13,Variety,"If you want to enjoy a buffet of painting, this is the place for you.  The current ""Visible Vaults"" exhibit gives a good overview of the various collections and with pull out drawers, you can see as much or as little as you want.  The iconic water fountain in the main lobby is gone, but not the amazing patinings, such as ""The Adoration of the Shepherds"" by El Greco, a small painting for this artist.",40,San Diego Museum of Art,December 2017

The last couple ""farmer's market"" I've visited were more or less craft fairs.  I loved seeing all the local fruit and vegetables, cheeses, oils, and flowers in addition to the food vendors who sourced locally.  While there still was a section of handmade goods (non-food) it didn't dominate the market.  ",40,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,June 2017
jjjSD,BEST Farmers Market Ever!,"The Little Italy Farmers Market is one of the best I've ever been to.  The range of prepared foods, produce, meats, and other delicious artisan products is amazing.  There are also vendors selling handmade jewelry, clothing, home decor, baby items, and other unique gifts.  For non locals, it's a great source for souvenirs.  The market is usually pretty packed so go early or later, after lunch.  It stretches for several blocks and has views down to the bay.  If you want a sit down Little Italy is a prime spot and all within a few yards of the market.  On a sunny Saturday, there is nothing better!",50,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,July 2017

Jack Cooper. He is a former fixed and rotary wing pilot with extensive experience flying helicopters in Viet Nam. His knowledge of the museum exhibits is encyclopedic and his comments were both entertaining and educational. Being a pilot, I was able to appreciate his commentary and his responses to my questions. This museum is a must see for both pilots and non-flyers young or not so young. The fact that it is free is amazing!",50,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,February 2016

It also had several short movies about varying subjects.  Nice opportunity for students and adults alike to view these nice displays.",40,San Diego Natural History Museum,December 2017
Dmarkwind,"Nice, but smaller than we were expecting","Dinosaurs are typically my top interest in visiting natural history museums. This place had a few on display, but the exhibit they were part of, called Fossil Mysteries, was actually a timeline from the age of dinosaurs to the ice ages, so the emphasis was more about prehistoric mammals and what came after the dinosaurs. My favorite area here was the third-floor exhibit called Extraordinary Ideas from Ordinary People, which featured stories about citizen scientists. It talked about people from the San Diego area who weren’t trained as scientists, but made a difference for science and the environment. We also enjoyed Unshelved: Cool Stuff From Storage, which was just a collection of items from the museum’s archives that hadn’t been on public view for a while. Other exhibits covered skulls, California ecology, conservation, and there was a nice exhibit of photos from Baja California on the fourth floor, which was basically a balcony for the lower floors. What they had seemed well done, but I guess I was expecting more and larger exhibits. We got through this museum in less than two hours, which is surprising for us, since we tend to take lots of photos and read almost everything.",40,San Diego Natural History Museum,December 2017

deborahsapp8,Too expensive - nothing really to see,This was not worth the money or time to visit. It is a nice path to stroll but could have skipped it. I can see asking big for a $5 donation or something  like that but it is $12 and literally takes like 15 minutes to stroll through and there isn’t any fantastic gardening. The highlights are the man made streams. ,20,Japanese Friendship Garden,July 2018

Matt C,Great Farmers Market in little Italy ,"Fresh Sea Urchin with Poke - it was so good, if you're an adventurous eater, you'll appreciate and love this dish, and yes, it really is delicious. Again, it's all fresh,  so you won't have that fishy taste, rather, it's a clean, meaty tasty, slightly sweet from the added sauce they mix the poke with, but quite delicious. As we continued our market crawl, we picked up some organic pistachio brittle (delicious brittles of several variety from Linda's Brittles), as well as some amazing Guiness PB Cookies - big, soft delicious Guiness infused peanut butter cookies with the added over the top addition of crispy bacon bits mixed into the cookie, getting an added treat in every bite.",50,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,March 2017

Now, belly up for your wine tasting and learn that you can walk around this cute village, wine in hand, and amble into the sweet shop and get a chocolate tasting/pairing to go with your wine - you can do this each time you taste!  Nice little cafe where you can also get a charcuterie/cheese plate/sandwich to go with your wine.  Other little shops to explore here, too, clothes, olive oil, etc.  Plenty of outdoor seating while you sip and taste.

The only disappointment was when it was time to leave.   The restaurant, Cafe Merlot was wonderful, robust salads, Mimosas and outdoor seating to take in the people and music.  The Sweet Shoppe has exotic mixes of chocolates, and the owner gives little taste pairings with your wine. The wine itself was not fantastic,  but I am not giving up, this place is special..I may choose from the library selections next visit.  I am hoping to go back this week to share this hideaway with a dear friend.",50,Bernardo Winery,September 2016
lindanueva,Winery,"Great atmosphere and wine. We went on a Friday evening and they had a live jazz band. I had a salad for dinner and it was just okay. Other people with my group really liked their food so maybe it was just my salad. I probably should've read the menu better as mine had purple onion which I dislike. Also the feta cheese was a little to strong for my liking. Prices were reasonable, I only paid $12.99 for my salad. ",30,Bernardo Winery,October 2016

Delicious!",50,Bernardo Winery,October 2016
SusieRick,Great Al Fresco Treat!,"I love this place for so many reasons: first off, it's tucked in an exquisite little winery that's packed with adorable shops and fun little places to sit and enjoy. Second, I love the experience of eating outside on a Sunday morning, sipping a mimosa while listening to someone playing the keyboard. (Don't pass on the mimosas, by the way - they're sensational!). I also love the top-notch, warm and friendly service Joy and Linda provide - it's always a treat to see them. As for the food, some days have been sensational, while most others have been okay and not really memorable. Still, I'd always recommend this place for all the other reasons.

I think you could see it all in less than an hour, but I stayed for longer: I found a shady bench and spent some time with my sketchbook after wandering the paths. It is built on a hillside, so you may want to take that into account if you have mobility issues.  There are wheelchair accessible routes, but I imagine it might not be ideal if you just don't like climbing hills.    We were here on a Monday in January so it was not at all crowded, but the sunny weather was perfectly comfortable.",40,Japanese Friendship Garden,January 2018

It was a reasonable way to spend an hour in Balboa Park but I probably would have enjoyed myself more were it half the price.,30,Japanese Friendship Garden,October 2017
Walker S,Often over looked but worth a few minutes to check it out for FREE,"Known as San Diego's ""jewel box"" of fine art, the museum is free admission and located in the heart of Balboa Park.

Two corporate donors provided the colorful umbrellas, chairs and tables in a previous parking area.  SDMA has added some sculptures to the mix;. On one recent Friday evening, a few food trucks had pulled in, long lines of eaters snaked around the plaza while live music got a few people dancing in the street.

mbcHAMMER,Not your typical Winery,"Think of Bernando Winery as a little village, there are shops, restaurants and such in this cute little middle of nowhere location. The tasting room leaves a lot to be desired as there really isn't one - they expect you to sit outside and constantly go back in to get another sample. This place isn't your typical ""dream"" winery that you could find elsewhere in CA. The stores inside the little village are good if you are 50+ otherwise the contents inside will seem very outdated and nostalgic. The lady in the chocolate shop was pretty rude; there are also signs everywhere NO DOGS ALLOWED (we saw 3 dogs) ONLY 1 SAMPLE, I mean can everyone relax? What was the hidden gem here was the coffee shop, best latte EVER - seriously, so good I'd return just to get another. This place overall gave me sort of a weird vibe, maybe its a community of vampires & zombies?",30,Bernardo Winery,June 2016

Enjoy!",50,Timken Museum of Art,April 2015
Belgo96,Exquisite musuem the highlight of Balboa Park,"The most striking feature about virtually all of the exhibits in this exquisite little museum in San Diego's impressive Balboa Park precinct is their immaculate appearance. From the Russian Icons painted on wood (and notoriously susceptible to decay), to the delicate French tapestries, and the discriminating collection of paintings. The standard of their condition is exceptional. I'm not sure if this is a result of thorough restoration or careful maintenance but seeing art look so 'alive' is a rich and rewarding experience.",50,Timken Museum of Art,September 2015
Annette_and_Wes,Worth a visit,"As others have mentioned, this is a very small museum. They have not tried to cram the space with lots of art.

rpcverin,Seasonal Experience,"I went to the garden in October. Unfortunately, very few things were in bloom. I definitely see the potential for this facility to be lovely in the spring, but it's not really worth the admission fee in the off-season. If I remember correctly, the map actually listed peak times for blooms as between March and July, so perhaps it's a better experience during that time. The garden does have seasonal exhibits as well for an additional cost. ",20,Japanese Friendship Garden,October 2017
ed_in_510,What an awesome museum!!!,"I've been to thi museum before and really liked it.  I enjoyed re-visiting some of the permanent exhibits, like the Fossil Mysteries, the Coast to Cactus and the Skulls exhibits, but two new exhibitions really hit home with me, and in different ways.  The Photo Ark exhibit, a series of photos of mostly threatened and endangered species, but also some with stable populations, was dramatic and moving, especially with the narrative pieces on the walls talking about some of the animals displayed in the photos.  Truly a dramatic and powerful exhibition.  Do not miss it!  Also the new permanent exhibit, ""Extraordinary Ideas from Ordinary People:  A History of Citizen Science"" is a wonderful celebration of the inherent curiosity of ordinary people, and how that curiosity matters and can make an impact in the world.  Inspiring, and really great for kids and adolescents!",50,San Diego Natural History Museum,December 2016
Ian B,"Manageable size, good for all ages","While not as large as equivalent museums in other cities, I still found San Diego's version enjoyable. We especially enjoyed the local focus of the exhibits, showing what ancient fauna lived in the area at different points in time. The admission is reasonable. If you plan to see several of the Balboa Park museums, get a multi museum pass. If you are a member of a fellow ASTC institution, you may be able to get in free, as we did. Just remember your membership card. Many of the exhibits are hands on, so suitable for small children. When we were there, they museum had a small play area set up on the bottom floor where bored little ones could blow off some pent up energy. We'll be going back as we didn't get to everything in our too short visit.",40,San Diego Natural History Museum,December 2016

Matthew B,"Unfriendly staff, not kid/family friendly.","I love Balboa Park and hate to write a negative review about anything, let alone a place in this beautiful park. However, I have had several lousy experiences in this place. One example-and the last time I will ever go back to this place-I brought my young daughter, who was excited to see the latest exhibit of art. At every painting we stopped at to admire (every single painting, without exaggeration), we were 'reminded' by staff to remain the requisite distance away from each work of art we tried to see. The staff, I believe, were wigged out because my daughter is of grade school age and the art work is priceless. However, we clearly were respectful of the rules-as we have been to many art and other museums, and we understand the rationale for the rules, especially when it comes to trying to protect old and important works of art seen by countless numbers of admirers.  The annoying staff admonished us like school kids to stay behind the line at each painting, regardless of the fact that we were not even close to approaching the line.  Their overzealous and-I don't think it is too strong a word to use-simply obnoxious reminders at every single piece of artwork we stopped at just ruined any ability to relax enough to enjoy and 'see' the art. It was such a turn off that I complained and got a refund. Aren't museums supposed to intellectually stimulate patrons and impart a love of and enthusiasm for what they exhibit, in this case, art? It reminded me of a high priced snobby gallery rather than a museum. They give lip service to being child friendly, with a drab drawing room, but what's the point when the staff invokes fear in your child of potentially getting too close to their precious artwork (my daughter simply wanted to see the paintings, as she is small, as expected for a child). Perhaps they treat their donors' families better. I hope so. If you are not a donor, there are better museums in San Diego for families to be able to enjoy art without the fear of being scolded. Like all reviews, this reflects just my experience/ my opinion, and I was frankly annoyed that my daughter's excitement to enjoy art was ruined during this experience.  San Diego is beautiful and has a wealth of beautiful and worthwhile places to see. Balboa Park is well worth a visit, just not this 'museum' in my opinion.",10,San Diego Museum of Art,May 2016
GlobalGypsy_13,What a deal!,"The SDMA has spilled out with sculptures unto the plaza area, the new heart of Balboa Park. You can enjoy the sculptures while watching history pedal by in vintage carriages for two (see snap) that are modelled after the ones used in the Panama California Exposition of 1915.  You can dine in Panama 66, SDMA's outdoor cafe with adjacent  sculpture garden at one end of the plaza, or catch a quick bite from one of the vendors to eat under one of the many umbrellaed tables around the water fountain. Or just relax after visiting SDMA and watch the world of Balboa Park go by.  Extended through the end of 2016 is $5.00 admission after 5 p.m. to SDMA on Fridays, and through September food trucks are also scheduled for the plaza.

They have a large external exhibit garden with fighters and attack aircraft from WWII right the way through to the current F/A 18 and all manner in between.

We were told that the dinosaur exhibit would be closing in a couple of days, and that the admittance charge was nearly double the regular admittance fee.  We went for the exhibit rate, as we definitely wanted to see some dinosaurs.  The big limited exhibit was neat, but a little much for a 2 yr old.  I think it would be great for a child 5 yrs old and up.  After we checked out the big dino exhibit, we headed upstairs.  My son loved the baby mastodon!  As we explored more, we ran into some dinosaurs!  These were great because my son could touch them and take pictures near them.  These dinos were included in the regular admittance fee.  It would have been helpful if the folks at the front/admittance desk had let us know that there were indeed some dinosaurs to see with the regular admittance fee...kind of felt like they were just going for the higher admittance fee.

Bruce M,"Compact, but worth a stop.","This is not the Smithsonian or NYC Natural History Museum.  And, it's pricey if not bought on a package or a free Tuesday (one per month).  But membership is covered for less than two visits and special exhibits can be fabulous for a museum this size.  For little ones, the second floor is a great exhibit of dinosaurs and more modern critters.  Older children will enjoy an hour or two, especially on a docent-led tour.  Adults have more to ponder.",40,San Diego Natural History Museum,October 2017
BBHJplus3,FREE Marine Corp museum - lots of history,"Did I mention free???  This is not in the city, but if you are nearby, and are a history buff, it's worth it.  We spent less than an hour inside the trailer, and less than an hour ourside looking at all the planes and other vehicles outside. There is a small giftshop inside as well.  Veteran volunteers are onsite to answer questions.  Very nicely done.",40,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,November 2014
Heidi D,"Great, Free, Full of History","A great, free, fun place for people of all ages and abilities. It is amazing to get to see up close and personal relics of history that mean so much as Americans. I think it is places like these that need our support! There is even a gift shop with something for everyone! And a coupon is available for a discounted item inside the local tourist magazine. A MUST SEE!",40,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,November 2014

ColinW757,Fourth visit in 9 years - outstanding.,We dropped in to the museum for the fourth time as we had enjoyed the friendly and well displayed airplanes and artefacts. This time we met the awesome Richard 'Touch' Toettcher who was full of fascinating stories and facts and really enhanced our visit. I also noticed they have added several new aircraft and renovated many to a very high standard. Outstanding museum very highly recommended. We will be back on our next visit for sure!,50,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,December 2014
DebMRoswell_GA,Fabulous,"I wish we had planned a longer day here.  We arrived after lunch at about 1, and we had already eaten.  But there is a little restaurant there that looked delicious.  We found a table and settled in as it was Sunday and at 2 they have live music.  We had a flight of red tastings- the wine was all good:)  The place was eclectic and adorable- shops to wonder through and people to watch.  Would go back in a heartbeat!",50,Bernardo Winery,April 2017

Recommend you take the doscent tour as they add highlights you may not have considerated. I was surpsied at the variety of art in the museum. I especially loved the modern sculpture on the main floor. The museum was updating their works so some of the rooms were under construction as they changed over. Had a handicapped person with us and they were great about waiting for them to take the elevator and catch up. Friendly staff and knowledgeble. Lots of other museums in the park worth visiting.

MushnKit,Good Marine Aviation Museum Next To Miramar,"This is a reasonably sized museum and air park located adjacent to NAS Miramar. The internal museum exhibits are informative and well laid out (the models are great), although a little cramped (so try not to take too much in). There are two air parks, one out the back of the museum building, which is the larger one, and one out the front opposite across the car park. Dont miss the smaller one, it contains a good selection of A-4 that show the type development, and three rare to reasonably rare airframes : an RF8G, an RF4B and the last production A4, an A4M. In the main park do not miss the F9F8P at the far end. Staff are friendly and the exhibit is free. It is also well signposted on Miramar Road.",40,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,November 2015

garygeorge3,Well worth a stop,"Located just down the road from Miramar base, this is a great little find for young and old alike.  With ample parking and free entry, this just needs to be enjoyed.  You are welcomed by a volunteer, who asks for nothing more than your zip code or if like us, your country of origin. A short explanation follows, then you're able to wander round at your leisure.  There are two display areas, one containing a lovely display of A-4 Skyhawks, at the rear of the building, is the larger display, a footpath leads you around the exhibits, each with an explanation of the type and a history of the aircraft concerned. Back in the main building are several interesting rooms each with a theme, and a gift shop with very pleasant and friendly staff. Do remember to leave a donation before you go, they rely on these. A lovely way to spend a few hours.",40,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,January 2016

Vendors galore, samples are very generous (you won't get yelled at here) and delicious.  Music, aroma of the food and flowers fills the air.  The vendors are happy and nice.  Great variety from food to drinks; citrus to veggies to homemade and unique art.  This is a great place to spend your Saturday morning while in San Diego. The market opens at 8 to 2 but if you get there a little early you don't have to wait like cattle for gates to open, just meander through the 5 long blocks of happiness.  We thoroughly enjoyed our Saturday morning - there is something for everyone!!",50,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,July 2017

It is a quirky little place - winery owns tasting room and the small restaurant and sweet shop, other small businesses are leased out.  This is in the middle of a residential area so don't expect to see acres of grapes.  The old barn from the original wine making days is still there and rented out for events.

Davigeta,Meh,"Outside of the museum looks nice. Inside, there's a very limited collection. If you are not interested in scenes of war brutality or Russian icons or Jesus/the Virgin Mary, you will find little to enjoy. Yes, there are some famous artists and a few good pieces, but not enough, I think. Worst part of our trip was the woman who ""greeted"" us by confiscating my wife's purse and my small bag. No big deal, EXCEPT everybody else was allowed to carry bigger items all over the place (we had some very valuable things in there, thankfully nothing stolen). They should NOT single out some people like this. In my opinion, they need to be consistent on this policy, one way or the other. Definitely a place you can miss,",20,Timken Museum of Art,May 2017

The oceans movie was good, and the Ice Age one was informative although a bit too much CGI. The water exhibit was cool and relevant. The fossils section was alright but nothing exceptional. The museum is a bit pricy at $19, but I would recommend it to someone that has time to spare and is interested in the stuff.

I enjoyed it because its centered around Marine Aviation.,30,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,January 2017

You can take your wine glass when tasting wine and walk down to the chocolate shop to sample chocolate or stroll to one of the other shops on the winery property and shop.. I was disappointed because the cafe is closed right now but they tell me that the cafe will have special Sicilian cuisine when they reopen soon. The day we went to the winery (Friday) was the Farmers' Market day.  So many vendors and so many wonderful things to buy.  A wonderful experience.  They also have music on Sunday afternoons.

The travelling exhibits are always first rate (in fact, we have several times driven to San Diego primarily to go to this art museum for special exhibits) and the permanent collections, though small, are curated well.  One thing to consider, though, is parking which, though free at Balboa Park, can be quite congested so plan your route beforehand.  There are several locations of parking areas.",50,San Diego Museum of Art,May 2018

If I was a local, I would probably go there every day just to sit and be at one with nature.

The docents are pleasant and knowledgeable and some of the old timers really had a long history of active and nonactive/retired service so chatting with them is the key to the experience. The planes are weathered and you can really see the harsh use from military service.  Admission is free and donations (standard $5) is money well spent.

We bought fresh bread, fresh goat cheese and a fragrant olive oil to share with a bottle of wine at Water front park( again, just a few blocks walk) we would’ve loved to indulge in the fresh veggies and fruits, but we were just visiting!",50,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,May 2018
Mytravelbucket,Farmers Market at Little Italy,"In order to avoid traffic and any parking issues we hopped on the trolley early Saturday morning and arrived at the Little Italy Farmer's Market around 9am. The weather was perfect and the crowds had not yet arrived. There were plenty of booths/kiosks set up with a wide variety of products. Our first impression was that this is a great activity for the family with little ones and teens. The morning we visited there was a box car race happening at the elementary school. The kids showed off their cute box car decorations and raced down the side street. At the market there are tempting prepared foods, sauces, smoothies,cookies, fresh baked bread and fresh organic vegetables. As we strolled thru the approximate 5 blocks of booths the crowds did eventually arrive but everyone seemed to be having a great time. You can stop and taste organic peanut butter or maybe a smoothie. We opted to buy a bag of Tumeric Tea  which is delicious and a loaf of fresh made bread. The Farmers Market is a fun place to spend a Saturday morning. We plan to visit again next month to fill our supply of tea and discover something new to eat.",50,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,May 2018

Vitalina2,Bernardo Winery was so charming,"We visited this Bernardo Winery during our visit to San Diego and we had a very nice time.  We got there with reservation and we got a table at the restaurant right away.  We were in the mood for Pasta.  Well let me tell you, it was the best pasta we had in a long time, it remind me of the pasta we had in Tuscany last year.  They have their own garden and all the produce are fresh and with a taste our of this world.  We had a bottle of rose wine and I wanted to keep on drinking but we had not done the wine testing as of yet.  They gave us one of the wine as asked us to go the the chocolate stand outside to get a sample and the taste of that wine just exploded, wow, wow, wow.  Love it.  We stoped at the gift shot and we got a bottle of olive oil with a Jalapeño base taste, super good.  We walked around the property and took a few pictures of the winery.  I would definitely go back while in town.  ",50,Bernardo Winery,August 2018
Joe G,"Historic, sprawling collection of shops and winery.",This place is more than a typical winery in that it incorporates historical aspects of life in the 1800's including unique shops with one of a kind items for sale.  The wines are great and the tasting room is wonderful.,50,Bernardo Winery,September 2018

Henry B,"OK Wines, quaint shops","My wife and I spent part of a beautiful Sunday afternoon here. The shops are supposed to be artsy and non-chain, but have you noticed how they all look alike and have the same stuff? This place is no different. We sat in a shady area eating a cheese plate (enormous with 4 different cheeses, pomegranate, strawberries, figs, grapes and fig bread, crackers, and rosemary focaccio) big enough for 4. The wines were OK. The live jazz trio was fun and lent a relaxing ambience to the area.",30,Bernardo Winery,October 2018
crg505,Unexpectedly Blown Away!,This is a fantastic museum!  I ended up there for several hours in the morning and then went back to see the rest after lunch!  The American Art had a wonderful selection including some by Georgia O'Keeffe that I had never seen -special for me coming from New Mexico.  The European Art is incredible with something by all the greats!  The paintings from the 1300's to 1700's were exquisite.  The light in paintings of Venice from the 1700's was marvelous.  The art of East Asia with the ancient Buddhas was powerful.  I can't say enough about how wonderful this museum was!,50,San Diego Museum of Art,July 2018
pinayp2016,Very impressive museum ,"It was a hot day in SD Balboa Park. so we decided to stay cool inside the museum of Arts.

PB-Drew,A hidden special spot,"As a San Diego native, I find it always interesting to find forgotten or less known places of ""Old San Diego"", The Spruce St. Footbridge is one of those hidden gems. Easy to find with a great view of the canyon below. As noted by my fellow contributor, Please be respectful of the local residents. The first thing you will notice is the construction and old school beauty of the bridge, The walk across is exciting and bouncy (Suspension type) so if you have a problem with motion sickness, be advised. That said, take in the view and the wonderful experience of walking through yesteryear",50,Spruce Street Footbridge,August 2015
ReneeVG-,Fun!,Just happened upon this little gem. The views are beautiful here. As we went on a Sunday there were quite a few people on the bridge. Definitely not for anyone with a fear of heights or motion sickness. The bridge felt very sturdy and safe but it does move quite a bit from people walking across! Coming back with the kids. ,50,Spruce Street Footbridge,March 2016

barisaxman,A quirky side-trip if you like bridges,"This suspension bridge gets you from one side of a deep canyon to the other side in the Bankers' Hill section of San Diego. For foot traffic only, and built over 100 years ago.  No one else on the bridge mid-Friday afternoon when I found it. When it's empty like that, you can jump or shift weight from side to side quickly and make the structure shake.  I enjoyed that, but you may not. And I don't recommend doing it when there are strangers on the bridge.  they many not enjoy it either!",40,Spruce Street Footbridge,October 2016
HawaiiAndi,Short Visit,"This was a quick visit, maybe 10 minutes. Walked (and swayed) across the bridge. The bridge will sway with a lot of people walking across. Its well maintained.

chickabeegrrl,Free for all,Excellent museum that is absolutely free to the public. We easily spent an hour in this museum admiring the various works of art. Each painting was well curated and very interesting. It’s not designed for children but any fun and informed adult can use this museum to really educate children about the arts. It helps that the place is small so that can work well given that children have short attention spans. ,40,Timken Museum of Art,June 2018
alicecH3793RF,Cherry Blossom ,"We went to Japanese Garden in Balboa Park for the scenery of cherry blossom. Lots of people lined up to get in. The cherry blossoms were great, we took some pictures.

We plan to come back  again when it’s free for San Diego county residents- every third Tuesday of the month.",40,Japanese Friendship Garden,March 2019
Jekela,Gorgeous Stop,"This was a beautiful and peaceful stop in Balboa Park.  It is wheelchair friendly (one member of our party was in a wheelchair), but not overly convenient.

GrandmaNancyC,"Good museum, great movies","We were able to get into the museum free because of a membership we have at another museum.  I would not give this one five stars as a museum--maybe 3 1/2--but I gave it this rating because by paying only $5 we were able to watch ALL 3 of their big-screen movies.  The other museum nearby charged $10 per movie.  What a great way to spend an afternoon.  We hit the free Tuesday for locals without knowing it, so the museum was pretty crowded, but good anyway.  I would rate it higher for kids than adults.",50,San Diego Natural History Museum,January 2019
redbar0n17,Free (closed on Mondays) volunteer-run museum with mostly outdoor aircraft exhibits,"This volunteer-run museum has a ""mom and pop"" feel to it despite being at MCAS Miramar. Closed on Mondays, and look for ""open cockpit"" days when you get to sit in selected jet and WW2 aircraft. The indoor exhibits (and restrooms) are in a small temporary building and include mostly memorabilia - no flashy multimedia here. Since it's free this would be a good place for a large family for 1-2 hours, as long as the smaller kids are not running wild. There is a picnic table if you bring your own food. The gift shop has some unique souvenirs and toys related to Marine aviation.",40,Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum,August 2017

The choices are great, and they for the most part have given more room for people to walk. A great place to see and taste the local happenings!",50,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,August 2018
cortp,Huge farmers market ,This was a great farmers market with plenty of fresh fruits and veggies and lots of treats to try. The vendors we spoke with were all very friendly. Not a ton of artisans or anything besides food vendors. You also have to cross several busy streets with crossing guards. Overall a fun way to spend an hour and get some treats.,40,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,September 2018
nitpicky-traveler1,Stressful with no parking spaces and crowds,"We tried the Mercato Farmer's Market for the first time. I have been to many in several different states and California usually has some of the best with all the amazing produce options BUT... part of going to a farmer's market is to relax and enjoy the booths.  This farmers market is downtown and of course the City of San Diego wasting their money on the $30 million library forgot to actually first fix their streets downton.  So it took us over 35 minutes to find a metered parking spot...only ones left unless I wanted to pay $30 for 12 hour parking at one of the lots!!! Then we walked about 15 minutes to get to the farmers market which stretches onto several streets. The food booths and produce were the typical ones you would find at any farmers market.  The prices were just about the same, except the crowd was about triple.  The people with dogs and double-wide strollers were having  difficult time maneuvering through the crowds. We looked at most of the booths, some make their rounds at every farmers market so if you missed it here, you can go to another one with less crowds and better parking to get what you want.  I probably will not be going back and actually the Sunset market in Oceanside is much nicer and much less stressful.",30,Little Italy Mercato Farmers' Market,October 2018
TouristMYLover,Lovely farmer's market in Little Italy,"Staying at Little Italy for 2 nights and by chance there was this lovely market on Sat morning. Lovely market with local fresh produce such as flowers, fruits, organic produce, sauces & a lot more. Not much food stalls selling hot food to-do go though.

Susie1028,Winery in San Diego,"I love this winery located in the Rancho Bernardo neighborhood of San Diego. It is located in the suburbs, so it doesn't provide nice views of vines and rolling hills. But it does offer a cute collection of old-timey shops, restaurants, and wine. We did the tasting (16 dollars for 5 healthy pours and a complementary chocolate with each glass). We sat outside on a Sunday afternoon, enjoying live music and some food from one of the restaurants along side our wine. A nice place to spend an afternoon.",50,Bernardo Winery,March 2019

TrademarkTraveler,Great if you live around San Diego,"The San Diego Museum of Art is a very nice local treasure.  It's in Balboa Park, which is a lovely place to picnic, walk, relax - and see some art.  The museum has a fascinating collection - but let's hope you already know a lot about the works on display, because the description information is Modern Minimalist.  Here's an example.  In the display of Near Eastern art, we saw a bowl with two painted figures and a lot of Arabic script around the inside.  Probably the writing describes something - and may offer a clue as to the purpose of the bowl.  It might even have identified the individuals shown.  But, who knows, because the description of the bowl is along the lines of ""Persian bowl, 1100 AD.""  One of the few translations provided was with Diego Rivera's ""The Hands of Dr. Moore.""  That was helpful.  Wish there had been additional descriptions/translations to assist us in appreciating the beautiful art before us.",30,San Diego Museum of Art,January 2019

carol700752,A fun little treasure. Easy.,This was a fun adventure.  We saw some interesting San Diego homes along the route getting there.  We parked very near on a neighborhood street. The suspension pedestrian bridge offers a high view of local flora.  It sways just a bit.  Easy to do if you want a wee bit of adventure but can't walk far.  My 85 year old mother thought is was a hoot. A local told us the bridge was built so the well to do on one side could get to the train stop on the other side of the big ravine. There were about 5 steps.  Perhaps no steps on the opposite side though?,40,Spruce Street Footbridge,August 2017
Galen C,Lots of Fun!,"I made a point of visiting this bridge while on a walking trip through the Hillcrest neighbourhood as it's not too far from there. Crossing this bridge was a thrill. It wobbles and sways as others walk along it. The guard wires do not leave you feeling particularly safe from certain death were you to fall into the picturesque ravine below. But if you're not afraid of heights and you enjoy a little perceived danger, this is an attraction I'd suggest making a stop at.",50,Spruce Street Footbridge,October 2017
Nutria2008,Fun quirky bridge to experience.  Over a century old!,"I ran there early morning.  Neighborhood looked nice, no signs of anything unpleasant and the area of the bridge and around was clean.

Over the past 3-4 years, my husband & I have become acquainted with & grown to love Green Flash beers at local restaurants at home in the Phoenix metro. During our trip to the San Diego area in August 2017, we decided to tour the brewery (partly based on the positive reviews). Great place, & we very much enjoyed the informative brewery tour led by Devin! We have toured several breweries over the years, & we both agreed that the Green Flash tour was one of the most interesting tours. We loved seeing & hearing all about this growing brewery! It was nice to sample several beers we don’t yet have available back home, too. Between my husband & I, I have a stronger preference for IPA beers, so I really enjoy the range of beers produced at Green Flash. Although I enjoyed all of the IPA’s I tried, my favorite was the Nelson beer (made with New Zealand hops). Although IPA’s are not the type of beer my husband would drink on a regular basis (he’s a bit more into amber or red beers), he definitely found several that pleased his taste buds while on tour.  The brewery has a nice tasting room with over a dozen brews on tap & had a food truck parked outside during our visit. Thanks for the great tour, Devin & Green Flash! We will definitely return! Cheers!",50,Green Flash Brewing Company,August 2017
DaveC2012,Great Place,"1st visit here and really liked it.  They have a large selection of beers and all of them I had were very good.  It is a large warehouse type environment which is very cool.  There is also seating outside.  They have counter service which basically means you order your drink at the bar and take it to your table which is pretty typical for this type of establishment.  They do not serve food but they do have a food truck available if you're feeling hungry. You may want to check their website for food truck hours but I think it is there every day.

My favorite song was the first one that Bruce played which was the graduation march. Very impressive on a pipe organ! His hands and feet flew across the instrument! It was a beautiful evening for sitting outside listening to beautiful music. How nice to have a free venue in the middle of a very expensive city!",50,Spreckels Organ Pavilion,August 2018

We love it and whenever in San Diego, it’s our Saturday morning go-to. We have our favourites like the seedy bread stall, the fresh guacamole, frozen cheesecake, sublime yoghurt, sublime fruit especially fig, hummus and fruit. We’ve also bought tableclothes, tee- shirts, baskets, cheese,beard trimmers,garlic shredders,divine balsamic and honey here, fresh squeezed pomegranate juice. There’s always something you haven’t noticed: this week Chinese jujubes. Lots of tasting and samples. Really a crowd scene.

We saw two shoppers stepping in dog droppings within 30 minutes and then tracking the same along the walkway.

The organ contains 5,000+ pipes ranging in length from the size of a pencil to 32 feet and is the largest outdoor pipe organ in the world. The Spreckels Organ is housed in an ornate vaulted structure with highly embellished gables. Since 1917, San Diego has had a civic organist, who performs free weekly Sunday concerts. All concerts on the Spreckels Organ are free to the public in accordance with the original Deed of Gift. Its a great experience.",50,Spreckels Organ Pavilion,February 2018
npoirri,Check the schedule,"We visited on a Wednesday afternoon. The trip advisor hours say 10am-2pm, and while the actual pavilion was open and able for walk throughs, the organ itself was closed off. I assume this is to protect it from weather damage and/or vandalism, but it was disappointing. I would definitely check the concert schedule to see it in its full glory.

Bosanchubo,DO NOT MISS THIS FREE CONCERT!,"Every Sunday afternoon at 2:00, a grand pipe organ concert (on the world's largest outdoor pipe organ) is presented free of charge, in Balboa Park.  For one hour, you will be amazed at the mesmerizing variety of sounds of the great organ, as well as the skill of the organist, who sometimes performs with his feet, faster than his hands! A well-diversified program is presented, from classics  to pop.  (Think:  J.S. Bach to Henry Mancini!)  There is a story and history about this venue, so check that out for yourself before you go, for greater appreciation/enjoyment.  It is my understanding that another concert will be added weekly to the schedule, later in spring/summer.",50,Spreckels Organ Pavilion,January 2018

The tour only took about 20 mins, and then we meandered thru the shops for several hours while drinking wine.  Great way to spend the afternoon with a bestie! Their main gift shop has excellent wine related gifts, and would e a good place to shop if you needed a quick wine related gift.  The parking lot fills up quickly so going at an off time would ensure a shorter walk. ",40,Bernardo Winery,February 2019
John R,Fun walking the Place & Shops - with wine,"This is a fun place to enjoy some shopping in cute little spots, eating in the restaurant and drinking wine along the way. The wine tasting is fairly inexpensive for a tasting of 5-6 wines which go from sparkling to to red blends. All are at best fair. BUT you do get a free Choclate with each glass of wine at the Chocolate Shop. The service though via ""Ronnie"" or ""Lloyd"" makes the visit well worth while. Plenty of parking but get there before noon.",30,Bernardo Winery,July 2019

cecesimms,stunning,"I had no idea about the Spreckels Organ before I stumbled on it on my way to the Japanese Friendship Garden. I was even more surprised that it was an outdoor organ, let alone the largest in the world, as I am used to them being in churches or movie theatres.  I was delighted that someone was practicing while I was there, so I got to hear its stunning sound. I also enjoyed the architecture, which created an ampitheatre effect. I would have loved to come back and enjoy a movie or concert.",50,Spreckels Organ Pavilion,September 2017
ThomasEMM,Looks great....missed the actual perfomance,"As part of out tour we spent a few minutes outside this San Diego landmark.

Travelin41126,It's worth the experience,"Everyone visiting San Diego should take in this experience.  It's so unique.  My only reason for giving a 4/5 review is because I was not a fan of the music selected.  In addition to solo organ pieces, an opera quality tenor sang, Italian, of course.  But the quality of the organ is nearly unsurpassed and should be experienced.  We had a lovely day and perfect for the outdoor concert.  As an added bonus is the architecture offered by the pavillion.  The Sunday concerts are at 2:00 and are free.  If you have kids, there are some free puppet shows for them as well.  Just as the park is a must see if in San Diego, so is this wonderful instrument.",40,Spreckels Organ Pavilion,November 2017
Martha345,Okay,"The thing I enjoyed most about this museum was the building itself. It is interesting and has a beautiful staircase. The museum itself was not great.

iluv2eatntravel,Hidden gem of an attraction,"We had to use a Google Maps to get us there but was totally worth it.  This magnificent bridge is a true suspension bridge in that it is held up by cables across a canyon.  It’s quite an architecture wonder to behold. While those who are afraid of heights might feel the jitters - it’s a 70 ft drop to the bottom and the bridge actually sways and bounces as you walk across it’s 375 ft span, it’s quite safe to do so as it is sturdy. Apparently the bridge is built to hold over 2000 people averaging 150 pounds each. As you walk along the bridge you can enjoy the view of the canyon below. At one end of the bridge there is a hiking trail to the bottom of the canyon.  It’s a real hidden gem of an attraction in San Diego.  It’s also free of charge to visit and cross the bridge.",40,Spruce Street Footbridge,June 2018

Thus, the viewer is engaged to ask ""why here"" with icons or in the Dutch gallery? However, many of the icons and famous pieces (e.g., Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Rubens) remains in this small, free museum. In addition to such fun and thought provoking shows, the Timken engages museum goers with a regular slate of programs that includes musical evenings, wine and art pariings, guest lectures, a collector's dinner, and trips to other museums (usually in LA).",50,Timken Museum of Art,March 2019

lostsmoothie,"Great, Compact Museum","The Timken is located in the heart of Balboa Park, with ample parking not too far away (you could also take the tram). First time visitors to the park and longtime locals should check it out, as the museum changes displays from time to time. The best thing about the museum, aside from the beautiful art, is it is completely FREE, all the time. The only day the museum is closed are Mondays, but otherwise their hours are pretty standard. The museum has two main rooms, filled with priceless works. The quaint size is perfect, not too big to overwhelm you but not too small to not be worthwhile to venture in. I would budget about 30 minutes to an hour for a first visit. As a longtime resident, it is great to pop into this great little gem anytime walking through Balboa Park to check to see what is new/changed.

Lesa M,Spreckles Organ Delights Music Lovers of All Ages,"The Spreckles Organ is the cultural gem of Balboa Park, and arguably all of San Diego. My husband, adult son, and I had an opportunity to attend two concerts there this past weekend. One celebrated the dedication of new pipes which restored the organ to its place as the largest outdoor organ in the world. The other was the regularly scheduled 2:00 p.m. Sunday concert. Both offered world-class music and featured the talents of organist in residence, Carol Williams. Ms. Williams is not only a marvelous performer, she is quite funny and candid and has an engaging stage presence. The organ itself, housed in an ornate 100 year old pavilion is a visual feast. Sitting in the audience, soaking in San Diego's perfect weather, stunning architecture, and celestial music is an event not to be missed by anyone visiting the city.

After driving around for 30 minutes with no parking in sight or even close by we finally left very disappointed. There are people directing traffic and letting cars in, which is useless because once you get in all of the lots are full. It took the full half hour just to drive around the park because there were so many cars. There has to be better parking for the amount of people coming in and the amount of attractions Balboa Park has. It was ridiculous. We ended up just going to the Corvette Diner so the drive wasn't a complete waste.

When I ordered a taster of a beer that had Belgian yeast (but the description didn't say that) & I handed it back to the tap person, she kindly comped my next taster and helped me select it. Gets a little noisy and busy inside once locals get off work. There is a nice beer garden outside that is kid and dog friendly. On the day we were there, a food truck was parked outside, not sure if this is an every day event or not. Our friends ate and said it was great.",40,Green Flash Brewing Company,May 2015

Frank-in-SF,Pleasant Way to Spend a Few Hours,"Recently went to the museum, probably for the third time.  All four of the small temporary exhibits were worthwhile, particularly the still lives and the photographs of Black life, which was in the one free section.  The permanent collection is quite interesting, if not extensive.  I very much enjoyed the Modern section, the American Art section has some fine works, and the European section on the second floor has some big name Old Masters and Impressionist works.  Keep in mind that this is not the Met or MOMA, but a rather small museum in a beautiful setting, close to several local attractions. For what it is, it's very good.",40,San Diego Museum of Art,October 2019

I learned that you need to leave extra time to park and walk because parking was hard to get.  I recommend if you are staying in Downtown to take the City Bus, like we did the remainder of the week.  Then you don't have to deal with it.  You can get passes at the transit store on Broadway (although they are not open on Sunday).   We went in to see the pipes after.  Really nice experience.

I also enjoyed visiting the fossils and mineral collection in one booth, but we probably spent only 30-40 minutes in this whole area before moving on, and none of our party made any purchases.

It reminded me of Santa Monica Beach in Los Angeles. The beautiful Soft White Sand went on for what seemed like miles in either direction. This was clearly a very popular beach but was not too busy mainly due to its huge size there was plenty of room. The beach is very well monitored and controlled by life guards manning bay watch style stations every couple of hundred yards. There are volley ball nets and many other activities along the beach front. I have to say the beach front looks amazingly clean and is definitely well looked after.,50,Mission Beach,August 2019

The tours meet at the Robinson-Rose Information Center.  The Blacksmith Shop was a working venue and very informative, and all the displays and buildings take you back to an era in history.

We had the wedding up at the back of the courtyard & arranged tables & chairs for the meal in the lower part.  zthey closed the building to tourists for the night so it was just a private party.  But regularly it has many shops that sell many Spanish themed products made by local artists.  Balboa Park has been in this location since 1915 to celebrate the opening of the panama canal.  You have to go there.  So much to see.  Several museums, places to eat. walk around with the family.  We went there twice on our 4 day visit",50,Spanish Village Art Center,October 2015

Rich G,Not a hiking trail - more of a technical challenge!,"We came thinking this was a hike down to the beach.  We love to hike, but this is NOT a standard hike.  Sure, the first tenth of a mile is simple, then it comes to a split and you can choose to climb UP to the hillside or DOWN to the beach.  Both require immediate technical challenge.  Going UP requires scaling a hillside after walking a plank.  This is not a simple task and geared for younger and less height-challenged people.  If you slip it's into a 10 foot ravine, so yes scary.  If you go DOWN it starts with walking a 12-foot plank (which you can easily skirt if you walk into a ravine.  They say the beach route is more gnarly and challenging than going up.  My teenage boys went UP, and us parents went DOWN, at least partially.  The down route wasn't so bad, and was very picturesque along the way.  About 40% down, you have to squeeze down a fissure and hold onto the wall to avoid falling through it.  You then emerge as though birthed at the bottom.  Not hard coming up. The path then gets even crazier requiring you to walk along the edge of a sloped hill and much more challenging footing with sand throughout underfoot.  I made it close to the edge of the beach route, but didn't finish.  The boys went to the top of the hill and had some challenging routes as well, but enjoyed it immensely.  We saw hand gliders and a terrific late afternoon sunset.  This is a great time, but not for the faint of heart.",50,Ho Chi Minh Trail,December 2018
usnwalker,Very challenging hike ,"My boyfriend and I hiked Mount Fuji in Japan and still found this hike to be challenging and scary.

skd22,Amazing Views,"This hike trail head starts in a very upscale neighborhood.  GPS guided us right to it, but we kept thinking we were going the wrong way.  The house right across from the trail was for sale...$30 million.  I'm sure they are not thrilled with the placement of the trail start.  Trail ends at a beautiful spot on the beach.  I think this would be a dangerous hike if it were raining or had recently rained.  Got some beautiful pics on our sunny day!",50,Ho Chi Minh Trail,March 2019
Beverly G,Gorgeous spot for exploring,"This is a length of shoreline in LaJolla, where, at low tide, the sandstone rocks are revealed, and you can see crabs and other sea life in the tide pools (not to mention tiny, beautiful sandstone formations).  The two-hour on-street parking limit is about right - we stopped there on our way into SanDiego (from the north) and it was a gorgeous spot. Great for kids and grownups alike.

So many people trying to find a spot and with the one way streets and congestion it’s just impossible to find anything.  There are a few pay lots but even those aren’t enough and if the coaster comes by it backs up traffic even more!  If you Lyft there it’s worth it, otherwise plan to circle looking for parking 30-60 minutes then pay for parking on top of all that gas money!  By the time you find parking you’re in a bad mood and it just kills the atmosphere.",20,Little Italy,June 2019
Jeff C,Restaurants & Market Place,"We love to go to open air markets, primarily to get a feel for the area and culture.  As expected, Little Italy has plenty of restaurants, shopping, and a Market Place that is quite popular.  Probably because we went on a Saturday morning to visit the Market, my impression was that of an over crowded tourist area that I just wanted to get away from.  People are aplenty and parking is difficult.  The market has plenty of food vendors and a light dose of arts and crafts.  I didn't really see or experience anything that caught my attention and while the food from some vendors looked appetizing I was sorely disappointed with what we tried which included: fruits, fresh (supposedly) farm produce, and crepes.  In fact I had the impression that Little Italy was a destination solely for the fact that it is there.  Wasn't too impressed",30,Little Italy,June 2019
sueakelly77,Little Italy,Little Italy was such a great place to visit. We went a few times during our vacation in San Diego. They have great places for lunch and dinner.

richy_roo75,Prepare yourself! ,"Ok we were fortunate enough to get a badge for all 4 days plus preview night for 2017. This was our first Comic-Con. So you need to be prepared to wait, no I mean wait for days not hours if there's someone or something you want to see. Example: for the infamous Hall H, this is where any A list people will do their panels. The process to get in is....well dare I say crazy! So the night before the panel you choose you must wait in line to be lucky enough to get a wristband, the hall seats 6500, but there are roughly 120,000 people attending daily. We waited over 3 hours to get that wristband. So now, you either stay the night outside in line with this wristband (to be closer to the front of the line) or return before 7:30am to be allowed to wait in another line to be allowed into Hall H for the panel. We arrived at 6:00am the next day & we're inside by 10:10am. So over 7 hours of waiting in line for one panel!  We still at this We did have an AMAZING time seeing the Big Bang Theory, Fear the Walking Dead, The Walking Dead & Game of Thrones cast speak. We were still a long way from the stage. But honestly most of Comic-Con is lines & waiting everywhere everyday. So go in knowing that. Pick what you Really want to see & stick to it. When we go back we will & I can't believe I'm saying this but... we will spend the day & night to be near the front of the line. It is a unique fun experience that you will not get anywhere else.

Gymjen41,Beach visit,"Went to ocean beach for a pre scheduled surf lesson - the surf lesson was outstanding and will review them on their site, but this beach was the least favorite of the five we have visited (mission, imperial, La Jolla, Coronado, Cardiff). First time I have felt unease in San Diego. Lots of homeless but more then that the beach felt dirty, lots of flies and bugs. Surf school told us not to use the public restrooms. It was fun to watch all the local surfers and fine to walk around and see a few of the shops, but certainly not a place I would plan to spend an entire day or make my base for a San Diego vacation",30,Ocean Beach,June 2019

Colleen P,Convention personnel very polite and professional at Comic-Con International San Diego CA,"I attended Comic-Con's 2011 convention during July 20th through July 24th and I must say the personnel were very polite and professional from the security to the food vendors.  The restrooms were always being attended to so there weren't shortages of toilet paper or paper towels which usually happens at large venues like this.  The janitorial staff were constantly picking up trash on the floors, emptying the trash cans and making sure there weren't tripping hazards on the floors.  It was the same outside on the sidewalks.  The security took care of questions, mostly had smiles on their faces and did their jobs checking badges for authenticity.  This was my 6th Con and the staff was as professional and polite as always.  I would hope that more conventions would book here in San Diego.",50,San Diego Comic-Con International,July 2011
LKJames,Too big for venue,"There was supposed to be an expansion of the convention center to accommodate larger crowds, but rumor has it that the idea was scrapped due to local objection.  So, why not move the entire convention to someplace used to dealing with crowds,  like Las Vegas?  Plenty of hotel rooms, lots of experience with huge crowds (ie CES), and lots of alternative entertainment for the non-geeks among the crowd.  Beats the heck out of disappointing thousands of potential attendees year after year.",30,San Diego Comic-Con International,July 2015

They were overtly using drugs. Many with dogs. We did not feel comfortable. I would not recommend this area. ",10,Ocean Beach,March 2019
teabee34,Won’t be returning ,"I wish I’d have done more research on this area prior to visiting and staying the night. The pier is currently closed (possibly due to large waves) and there are tons of transient and homeless folks crowding the boardwalk and beach parking lot.

Upekkhapr,Very eclectic crowd and very relaxed environment where everything goes...,"We were told to visit this and many other beaches like Coronado Island, Mission Beach and Pacific Beach... theses three were much more upscale and expensive areas. Ocean Beach seems more inviting for the people looking to surf and live a life without society rules overlooking and demanding. the lovely pier was closed for unknown reasons to all. Although some people might be scared to see people living on the streets on this beach, we also saw some at Mission and Pacific Beach and in the end they don’t seem to be looking for trouble, Just Peace... like all of us. Only some people find peace following the established rules and others find find peace making their own rules! I must say the bathrooms at Coronado Island park were much more clean and fancy compared to all other, although they All had toilet paper and running water!!!  Ocean Beach as the Coronado Beaches, give the opportunity for kids to run and get a bit wet while at the beach without getting into the water.

There are actually two theater stages at Old Globe, one indoor and one outdoor, we sat outdoors. For inside you cannot bring in beverage or food but outside you can bring your beverage. I recommend bringing two blankets, one to sit on and one to keep warm. But if you forget them there are some for rent. After seeing Hamlet there we realized every seat in the house is a good seat!

Friendly people. Beach was in good shape when I visited. Only downside, I forgot CA legalized marijuana, so that was a bit jarring. My first visit to a legalized state. I echo the concerns about homeless/mentally ill folks blended into the scene. I only had one run in, but was totally manageable. Overall though, totally worth an afternoon visit if you’re by yourself or with other adults.

The kids can climb and search around the spaces. It's hard to get the kids down. Then the kids discovered the clay station ... downstairs and outside. Clay allows your children to get their hands all messy (they have aprons to wear so their clothes stay clean) and create, at their own pace, their own masterpieces. If they choose, it's easy enough to roll the clay back into a ball and start again.  The museum provides assorted carving tools and cookie cutters to use.

JC_chgo,Watch the Surfers from the Pier- and the Sunsets,"It's difficult to actually stay in Ocean Beach, there are only 2 small hotels. But, since it's only 10 minutes away from downtown, stay there and take a day/evening trip or two.  Just take the 8 until it ends, voila you're in Ocean Beach. I've visited OB many times, and while it can sometimes feel touristy, it also has a great laid-back attitude that makes it a very relaxing experience.  I recommend the farmer's market/food market on Wednesday afternoons, don't get there too late or all the really good stuff is gone.  There's a bakery that always has pies, I forget the name but I remember the pies.  Also, of course, burritos.  And there's a barbecue booth, try the hot dogs with bacon.  Really can't go wrong.  Also some great Indian food, a cider brewery from downtown SD, um, what else? So many good food places show up there, just try what looks good.  As far as restaurants in town, there's actually plenty.  I'll just list the ones I like: Pizza Port (pretty noisy), Barbecue House, OB Noodle House, Raglans, Ulivo- both the pizza and pasta are great, and the atmosphere is better than most in OB; Wonderland (touristy I know) has a pretty passable fried fish taco (but not the grilled fish), and good clam chowder; OB Donuts has terrific breakfast sandwiches, and great old-school donuts; Newbreak Coffee (on Sunset Cliffs, next to OB Donuts) has great Acai bowls, coffee/lattes, and smoothies; Thai Time is pretty good; and- it may be a cliche but it's true, Hodad's has the best burgers in the world ever. Seriously.  And of course, nothing beats sitting in the park and watching  the sunset, unless it's strolling on the pier watching the sunset.  After dark, visit one of the many bars, they're all lively and they all have their own personality. Lately the brew-pubs have become trendy, there are plenty but also many old-school bars, all of which are fun. Again, can't go wrong. I think it's practically impossible to not have fun in OB.",50,Ocean Beach,October 2017

Hop you day was as good as ours.,50,The New Children's Museum,October 2015
Stephanie C,Good time but pricey,"I took my almost two year old son there on a dollar Sunday and I am glad I did because for kids under 3 it is not worth the regular admission price.  There are only a few things for his age so if you have a young one go on the target Sunday which is the 2nd Sunday of the month.  It really wasn't overly crowded, but parking was non-existent, had to park in a pay lot a block away.  He really enjoyed the sand box the most, also painting and the bubbles!",40,The New Children's Museum,October 2015

There were a number of organized events, like painting, make a tower, but if you were not there before it started, you missed out.  It needs more creativity and independent activities.  It appears to be aimed for 3-5 year olds, only.",30,The New Children's Museum,December 2015

Linda F,"The "" Bard of Avon"" Would Be Proud!","Even before we were able to move to La Jolla, CA, we would vacation in San Diego where we always booked our trip to correspond with Shakespeare at the Park. We always included our two girls so they could experience great theater. Now that we live here, we have season tickets and continue to enjoy the great productions. Each of the venues for theater our excellent, with our choice always being the original Old Globe.  We get reservations at The Prado for pre-theater dinner, and if a matinee, go to The Sculpture Garden for a pre-theater luncheon. Upon arriving to the beautiful veranda's of the three theaters, we reserve either wine, or deserts to have ready for us to enjoy during the intermission. Having them ready for us, with our name on them, allows for more time to savor the deserts and wash ourselves in the beautiful lighting upon the Museum of Man. All creating a magnificent evening or memorable times shared. We regret that they do not still have the Renaissance performers who entertained the audiences upon their arrival, as our girls have told us that their experience with the wonderful musical renditions and dances were the most positive way to introduce them to Shakespeare. I wish they would reintroduce this for the park's centennial. ",50,Old Globe Theatre,June 2016

Zell,Love the plays at The Old Globe Theater,"On each trip to San Diego, we always schedule at least one play at The Old Globe Theater.  The acting, the costuming and the staging for RAIN was wonderful and of very high quality.  All seating seems to have a good sight line.  The only thing that could be improved is to have restrooms on the main level instead of down a long flight of stairs, although I assume there must have been an elevator in the vicinity.",50,Old Globe Theatre,April 2016

Amber S,Terrible children's museum,"Maybe we're just spoiled with our awesome children's museum in Mississippi. I was expecting so much more when we visited today to get out of the rain. This museum is basically just one big play place that moms and dads with children ages 4 and under gather on a rainy day to hang out. There are no real exhibits of any kind here like other children's museums we visited. One exhibit was a toddler sized jump house (I kid you not) crammed with about 20 kids ages 3 and under. My children are 10 and 7, and were beyond bored. My daughter asked why it was called ""new"" when everything looked like it had been trashed. There were way too many people crammed in there today with very little to do. We left within 15 minutes of arriving. Thank goodness this was part of our Go San Diego Card 5-Day Pass or I would have demanded our money back. Save your money and skip it!",10,The New Children's Museum,April 2015
Victoria M,Visit with a 7 and 10 yr old,"We've visited before when my children were younger so I was interested to see how they would like it as older kids and they still loved it! They spent more than an hour outside on the patio painting and playing with the clay. The indoor climbing structure and ropes were great too and they loved seeing the chickens. While this is not a museum in the traditional sense of viewing exhibits, it provides kids a hands on, interactive way to explore art and I am all for that! My only complaint is parking, pay parking only but being that it is downtown there isn't much to be done about that. We definitely will visit again!",40,The New Children's Museum,May 2015

The comedy, ""The Metromaniacs"" was superbly written, truly funny, and exceptionally well acted. ",50,Old Globe Theatre,February 2016
Jay W,Metromaniacs: So What?,"The Old Globe is a wonderful theatre, with superb (almost all) actors, beautiful costumes and sets, and great accoustics.  Then why bother with a play that is as empty as this one?   Fun for some, tedious for others (we were bored).  Clever, many will think so.  Too bad there is really very little good new comedy coming from regional theatres or Broadway.  So, with this in mind, you can't fault Old Globe too much for doing this exercise in performing technique.   I would have looked back to a truly fully Restoration comedy.  Love when the Globe does a new work that is truly superb (such as the musical Scottsboro Boys (brilliant).   This was not up to the standard.  Sorry.",30,Old Globe Theatre,February 2016

Finger painting, clay modeling, bubble blowing, an inflatable to jump in, an area called Wobbleland for play, the Rainhouse, the food market/truck area are just some of the exhibits or activities.  Great volunteers assist kids with art projects.  There was a live chicken to be petted or fed by the kids with a volunteer assisting.  There are also many free play areas with chalkboards, building blocks, monkey bars, climbing ropes, etc.  plan on a couple hours at least.

We walked to dinner one night and never walked anywhere again. Even in daylight.

Linda C,"Extraordinary production of ""Full Gallop!""","There's still time if you hurry to see the extraordinary production of ""Full Gallop"" at the Old Globe Theater complex in Balboa Park.  How often does one get to see a multi- award winning actress (Mercedes Ruehl) in an intimate setting at a reasonable price?  She plays the great Vogue editor Diana Vreeland in a very well written one-woman show.  I was a bit concerned my husband might not appreciate this production, but he loved it.  Diana led an incredibly interesting life; Mercedes brought her back to life and made us appreciate what an original she was.

Jim H,The Metromaniacs at the Old Globe Theater - San Diego,"The Old Globe theater located in Balboa Park in San Diego was the stage for this fun-filled farce - The Metromaniacs.  The theater itself is worth seeing because of its similarities to the style of the original Globe Theater in England.  This one features a multi-level indoor environment with seats that have an excellent view of the stage ... there really isn't a bad seat in the house.  We sat in the plebian section ($39) on the second level and were quite satisfied with the stage-view and sound from our vantage.  The play itself, The Metromaniacs, was a creative comedic farce that featured rhyming dialogue throughout the performance, which is the basis for the story-line about Damis who falls in love with the verse (and person) of his favorite poet (who, as it turns out, turns out to be a man).  As in Shakespeare plays with twisted plots, this one is no exception as the action & dialogue ensues.  The play was well-acted with characters ""believable as they could be"" under the circumstances given in the play's plot.   The costumes were fabulous!  The sets, lighting, and sound were well-done.  In all, an engaging play in a theater well-worth experiencing.  It was a highlight of our trip to San Diego.",50,Old Globe Theatre,March 2016

Daniel B,Unsafe,"We went with our six year old for a day of fun. She had a great time and a lot of the interactive play was fun and imaginative. My concerns have to do with the building and some of the play structures. There is a ""tree house"" with very steep ladders that are an accident waiting to happen. There was no staff supervision of this structure. There is a sign at the entrance that adult supervision was required when inside. I was the only adult inside the structure. Our kid was almost shoved down the ladder by another rambunctious child, and if I was not present to catch her, she would have fallen six feet to the floor. Another concern are the concrete stairs throughout the building, not very kid-friendly in the event of a stumble. There is a complex rope climbing maze, again with no staff supervision. Another accident waiting to happen. I am an artist and I give kudos to the creative staff for the opportunities for the kids to explore different media. The building and lack of supervision is what concerns me.",20,The New Children's Museum,August 2017

TheTrueShakato,I go every year,"i do various events in the comic-con convention center every year, first things first, if you don't like crowds i wouldn't recommend going. this event gets sold out every year as it began getting more popular. there is many things to go for, you can try looking at the anime booths, finding actors in the exhibit hall, play games at specific booths, attend the panels which usually have some type of sneak peak per event (lines lines lines for everything) and plenty of things going on around the convention center that requires a pass. for example a bar nearby was giving free beer and food for just showing up with your pass, petco park was also hosting some sort of laser tag for free. One year i even got to see linkin park for free with food and drinks. ABOVE all if you really want to get the most out of this event, plan ahead using the event planner given as there is always something that you will miss during this event.  on a personal note i'm waiting for the day the convention center gets expanded if ever because although the convention center is large, the amount of people needing tickets (locals like me included) is getting larger and the demand is making it harder and harder to get tickets, i know plenty of people who try to get some every year and have never been.",50,San Diego Comic-Con International,July 2015

poonsang,TONS to do,"The place is awesome! Pay for at least 4 hours parking (street or lot) as your kids will not want to leave this place. Our day consisted of time in the soft, cool sandbox area, coloring tons of seafood and watching it animated on the screen, climbing a large indoor tree house, playing in a gigantic kitchen sink themed play area, forming and shaping things with clay, and ending back in the soft, cool sandbox area. And the kids (4 and 1.5 yrs old) could have gone on, but we needed to get to our next fun activity. The place has plenty for the kids to explore and it is well worth a visit. (I even noticed tourists walking through observing all the exhibits and activities for the children.)",50,The New Children's Museum,February 2018
Pras499,Meh,"You would hope that SD would boast the best.   This place falls so flat for quality and quantity.   Perhaps we are too simple to appreciate it.

Nerzie,Nice hike close to the city.,"This is a great resource close to the city. It is free to park and free to hike. We stopped in the very nice visitor center for a map and to ask for recommendations for first timers at the park. We ended up starting on the visitor center loop and then broke off to the South Fortuna trail and up to the summit of South Fortuna. The views were spectacular from up there. 360 degree views. The hike to the summit was cool too. Then we continued on the trail to meet up with Oak Canyon trail. The connection between South Fortuna and Oak Canyon is horrible. It is basically a gravel path that goes straight down. It was so slippery that we had to go down sideways on the side of the trail and still kept skidding. Be warned. The Oak Canyon trail was nice and we stopped at Mission Dam. We walked back on the road, which has a separate walking/biking lane. It was 3.5 hours to do the above hike.

We started at the Mission Trails Regional Park Tierrasanta Entrance, Clairemont Mesa Boulevard. There is plenty of parking space. But there is not any shadow and we were already exhausted when doing the first few minutes of walk from parking spot to the first trail crossing. So on the fly we decided not going for an extended walk but take the first peak. The trails are very well marked and we easily found our way. Bring enough water with you as there are no refill possibilities as far as we came. Yes and there was this nice smell of sage everywhere.

JJT2007,Disappointed ,"We went with a 4yo and 6yo. They had fun, but I thought the space was a missed opportunity. A few exhibits were winners but as a whole it’s not a great museum. There are lots of spaces hat are for kids over 5 only or 4 and under only which really didn’t work for my family. Plus we picked this activity to kill a few hours indoor on a really hot day only to find out that there is no A/C and it was uncomfortably hot in the museum. All said and done both the adults and the kids were ready to go after not even 2 hours, which doesn’t justify the $14/person admission in my mind. ",20,The New Children's Museum,August 2018

hulagirl98,Awesome,We spent an enjoyable late morning/early afternoon here for hiking. We combined a couple of trails together in order to make for a longer hike.  I did enjoy most of the hike we did as the scenery was fantastic. We did end up hiking up and down a series of 3-4 steep hills during our time here which was the part of the hike I did not like.  Along with hikers we met several mountain bikers on our journey.  We actually saw one of these guys attempt to go down on his bike one of the steep hills we hiked up. He did not make it (it looked painful).  Overall I felt this was a great place for some moderate type hikes. My only dig at this place is that parking was somewhat problematic- so my recommendation is that if you do not know the area check out on line what hikes you want to tackle so you know where to find parking.,50,Mission Trails Regional Park,January 2018
X3363HKandrewh,Always a blast ,Mission trails allows you to spend a quick or long morning adventuring around and experiencing the outdoors.

Loviecds,Not much for older kids,I went to the New Children’s museum with my little one when my husband and older son were at a baseball game. My son is 5 and there were only a few areas that he was interested in at the museum. I am not sure why it is called a “museum” as there was not much in the way of learning. There was a room to build with blocks. A room with sand with a few sand toys. There was an area with some climbing like a tree house. There was an area to do tracing with light tables. An area with a ton of tire shaped pillows to jump around. While my son spent the majority of the time here it was not friendly for parents to watch. The way it is set up it is hard to watch your child and feel comfortable they are safe. I was able to stand in a corner area where my son spent most of his time at. There was also an outdoor area where you could play with clay and leave your “art” to dry and then later take with you. Overall it was OK for my son and I to hang out at for a couple of hours while we waited for the others to watch the game.,30,The New Children's Museum,July 2018

Kathryn M,Great day-hiking place!,"Loved this place!  I came here to spend the day hiking. I had read the reviews before I went. I’m from Minnesota, so I wanted to make sure I was prepared.  It was hotter there than I expected in December… Got up to about 80° F the day I went.  It’s hotter here than it will say the temperature is in San Diego proper, due to being that much further away from the ocean. Even though I could’ve worn shorts, the sun exposure is so intense, I’m glad I wore light pants and had a light long sleeve shirt with. Could easily get sunburned out here, even with sunblock on!  Not a lot of shade available. Some very intense inclines, depending on the trail. The levels they have listed for hiking are true to their numbers, so make sure you know What you’re capable of, and plan out the trails are going to take before you set off. Especially if you’re not from here!  Pack a hat, sunglasses, snacks, a lot of water, & sunblock in a small hiking back pack, if you’re planning on taking any of the level 3 hikes. I hiked about 9 miles, which I planned for. I started at old mission dam parking lot, took Oak canyon trail up to Fortuna trail, to North Fortuna summit, turned around and did south Fortuna summit and continued on the trail to the San Diego River Crossing. You will get wet crossing the river, but I just took my shoes off before I crossed. I then did a bit of visitors center loop to Deerfield Trail (not a nice trail- wish I would’ve skipped it- it was kinda gross & full of garbage), and then finished around the visitor center loop, where I ended at the visitor center. The trails aren’t as clearly marked as I hoped they would be, so bring a map (they also have them available at Trail crossings) and keep checking your GPS on your phone, and you’ll be fine. Hiking sticks would’ve been nice to have on the inclines, as some of the trails were slippery due to loose stone. I recommend a good pair of hiking shoes, or at least a pair of trail running shoes, which is what I wore and they worked decent. I brought lunch, and took my time, resting when I needed it (the elevation & steep inclines were challenging but fun!). I could easily have taken another day or 2 here... I had some beautiful views at the summits and throughout the park. What a great place!! So glad I spent the day here!",50,Mission Trails Regional Park,December 2018
879beths,Well marked walking and biking path,"This is a well marked 3.2 mile walking and biking path with a little elevation change (not much).

The day had rain showers off and on, and it was quite for a weekend.  The outhouses needed maintenance.",50,Mission Trails Regional Park,February 2019

GlobalGypsy_13,"Bees, bugs, blooms, birds -- and you","This largest urban park in the US has more than hikes and/or climbing one of the five mountains.  On a warm March day (bring water or buy some at the visitor center) we took a gentle stroll along the Visitor Center Loop trail. Along the way we saw lizards, Spring blossoms about 8 different types), bees, birds, the San Diego River that cuts through the park, and few other folks.  The paths are well marked and maintained, but beware that the access road parts of the trail have loose gravel. Don't skip the Visitor's Center which has a museum room, wall photos, function rooms, a small library with fabulous views, a theatre, and a gift shop as well as restrooms. Near this center are 2 parking lots and also a lot off of Jackson St. where we began our  explorations with a map provided at the entry.

Easy to find, but the trails were sometimes challenging to negotiate as I was not used to the CA topography. Plenty of very wide, relatively flat trails in the southern section of the park - but for the adventurous there were very challenging single track sections that lead to some very steep and challenging hills to the north, including a couple of ""mountains"" to climb and take in the great views. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting this area.",40,Mission Trails Regional Park,June 2016

I witnessed many times and had to tell multiple children to slow down and wait your turn. I didnt feel it was my place to tell these kids to be repspectful of others but no one else was. It was actually kind of dangerous on some of the stairs/ladders, these kids were actually climbing over slower smaller children.

You can venture off trails in specific locations and head for the hills. The main entrance has the information center. We like to go to the part where Mast Boulevard ends near the 52 Freeway. It is a great place to saddle up your horse, hike, or take your bike for off-roading. There is a bathroom facility that is really clean and plenty of parking.

TooMuch2Do,Beach town with local vibe,"We’ve been to San Diego dozens of times but never to Ocean Beach.  My daughter was playing in a lacrosse tournament at Robb Field in early October so we rented an Airbnb for the weekend.  We arrived around sunset on Friday.  We drove to Newport Avenue and managed to find a parking space, which could be a challenge.  We walked down to the beach to watch the sunset, then back to Ortega’s for dinner.  OB is a rare beach town where ordinary people live that’s not been gentrified.  So you won’t find the Instagram-ready shops and on trend restaurants everywhere.  We saw some interesting characters, but at no time did I feel unsafe or threatened.  Slow down and take your time.  There are hilly narrow streets with very long traffic lights and many 4-way stops.  A short drive away we found Liberty Station with lots of restaurants and drove out to Shelter Island and Harbor Island and saw gorgeous night time views of downtown.  Some of town is directly in the flight path of the airport so read reviews carefully to avoid loud plane noise.",40,Ocean Beach,October 2019
Chris K,Surf's Up!,We visit San Diego and just love the atmosphere of Ocean Beach where we always visit...we are so lucky to get a spot to park on Abbot Street almost right next to the Pier...we go down to the water's edge and watch the surfers and enjoy the crashing waves and salt air.  It is crazy with people (of all types there) so be prepared for busy restaurants and stores!  Walk along Newport Avenue and you'll find everything as far as food and merchandise and there sure are always a lot of people who enjoy lining up for a bite to eat at Hodad's!  It's just a crazy awesome place and totally worth the visit.,50,Ocean Beach,November 2019

robertj192,This is a review based on trail running.,"I was very excited to run in a different place(I do 99% of my trail running in Nashville,TN).  The first problem that I had was where to go, if you are not familiar with this place you will have a difficult time finding out where to run.  I found another runner, and he pointed me in the right direction.  I will not really complain about the terrain, it is what it is, the lack of trees was surprising to me(not sure what I expected).  Again my HUGE complaint is again there were ZERO markings on the trails.  Luckily you could pretty much see everything(again, no trees).  Seems to me clearly marked trails would greatly improve this area.",30,Mission Trails Regional Park,September 2014

A dizzying amount of panels, San Diego Convention Center houses over 1/4 mile of floor space packed with high profile vendors. I saw the Marvel panel in the hardest hall to get in Hall H... it was a star studded affair as they announced phase 4... still I would not bother with any of it if I didn't have my cousin on the board of trustees for the convention center... too old to camp out for access...

Tried to queue for hall h for marvel but after an hour was told it was pointless. And it doesn’t stop there, there was loads of events going on around San Diego at the bars and pubs and even on the street. So definitely do your research so you know where else to head after the convention. I wouldn’t say it’s for all ages, I didn’t quite get the families trying to squeeze buggies down aisles of people but hey.",50,San Diego Comic-Con International,July 2019

We happened upon a informative tour Sunday morning and then went back another day to hike Mt. Cowles.  The hike sounded tough at first - they rate it a 5 of 5 for highly experience and physically fit people.  I almost didn't go.  But being age 50 and in moderately good shape I handled the climb without a problem.  The top half is easier than the bottom half which is not typically the case - so that was a pleasant surprise.  The views are well worth the effort and you don't even need to make it to the top to enjoy good views.  You can see the downtown skyline from here.,50,Mission Trails Regional Park,June 2013

Adventravler,"Big Place, OK for a convention","Attended ATD Convention with about 12,000. Can definitely hold the number but signage and concessions were a bit weak.  Great location right off 5th Street and next to the ballpark and on  the trolley line. One of the more convenient convention centers I've visited.",30,San Diego Convention Center,May 2018
GReyMaiden,Vast convention centre is superb bay front location,"Back in the San Diego Convention centre and always pleased to return.  Light, airy, easy to move around and huge.

SpikeIII,"Long, spread-out convention center.",Be prepared to walk.  Lots of space/area at this convention center. Would suggest using hotel close to convention center. Lots of places to eat within 3 blocks of center.,40,San Diego Convention Center,April 2018
Robert M,Beautiful Areas,"We stayed at a hotel near these islands and decided to drive out to the islands (conneced to the mainland via a short causeway) on a whim, just to check them out.  They are long and narrow islands that provide beautiful views of the bay and the Downtown area.  Plenty of eateries and other hotels (more sup-scale and beautiful).  Places to go fishing or just hike.  Both islands are right near the city but you get the feeling like you're off in a little fishing town.  If you like looking at a whole slew of sailboats and small yachts, it's very enjoyable.",50,Harbor and Shelter Islands,February 2017
egchora,Grab A Bike and Go!,"We rented two beach cruisers from the OEX Point Loma store and cycled to Shelter Island. This is a fun and relatively easy biking excursion that takes you to the Friendship Bell which is located at the western most cul de sac of the island.

The island houses numerous hotels and some restaurants as well.",50,Harbor and Shelter Islands,April 2017

2Luv2Trvl,Great place for a picnic,"Shelter island is a very nice place for a walk and a picnic.  There wasn't much of a beach, it seemed like the area was more for boat launching, fishing, and walking with a nice park.  It's not a true ""island"", it's actually attached to the mainland by a strip of land, where you'll find many restaurats.",40,Harbor and Shelter Islands,April 2017

coling549,Wonderful,"Lovely part of town for a leisurely hour or so, taking in the harbourside and all the surrounding views.  Of particular interest was Broadway Pier where you can walk to the end to look out over the harbour and see various wildlife and other marine activity.  We were very lucky and saw dolphins reasonably close up and a team of Navy Seals on exercise.  On the walk along the pier, the history of San Diego and its port is inlaid on brass placards in the ground in chronological order.  You literally walk through San Diego history.",50,Embarcadero,April 2015

There are walking paths, rental bike kiosks, marinas, hotels, even some free parking.  Watch locals sail.  We even saw the largest yacht in North America, the Attessa IV in the Bay.  A great place for pictures with the city in the background or bring a picnic and enjoy the grassy spot on the western side of Harbor Island while fishing from the rocks with the kids.  Even saw a wedding here once.  A must do for  tourists....if only for a quick photo with the city as your backdrop.",50,Harbor and Shelter Islands,July 2017

twinswin1,Fun even if you buy nothing.,"This is just a great spot for people viewing, boat watching, fried food gorging and getting bombed by live turkeys. No, wait, that's the Pine Dale Shopping Mall in Cincinnati, OH. For those of you unfamiliar with the tragic event, google it. It happened 10/30/78. Simply horrible. Anywho, two in my party were bombed by a seagull. Thank goodness I had a pack of Wet Ones in the old tote bag. Lots to see, lots to eat.",40,Embarcadero,July 2015

traveltoforeignlands,Nice way to spend a Sunday as a couple or a family!,"The Embarcadero is the place where you can catch one of the Harbor cruises or even the ferry to Coronado Island (It pulls in at Ferry Landing, where you can stroll, shop, bike or Rollerblade along the water's edge).  You can also visit the Star of India, an old sailing ship which I had the good fortune to sail aboard. One can also check out the famous aircraft The Midway or dine at some of the nice restaurants in the area, such as Anthony's Seafood Grotto--bring your wallet as it's a bit pricey :)",50,Embarcadero,November 2014
sinnerman07,ComicCon 2018!,We were here for SDCC 2018 and the place just keeps on giving.

GourmandTrashPanda,if you have harbor business only...,"If you need to deal with the harbor, then sure, come to the island. Otherwise you will only find sad resorts with pathetic restaurants and a boring marina. If you are a runner, you might be tempted to head out. Except the island is tiny and even despite the most creative attempts to elongate the event, you will only get about 5k out of it. I am here for a business meeting.

GlobalGypsy_13,For All Seasons,"Both Shelter and Harbor Islands that were made from dredging out the harbor are great places to walk and experience sweeping views of the bay.  Although we walk on Shelter Island daily, we never tire of the changing scenes -- music at Humphreys, nesting Osprey near the Kona Kai in the Spring, fisherfolk on the public pier, various shore birds, and in December either is a great spot to watch the annual Boat Parade of Lights.",50,Harbor and Shelter Islands,December 2017
Lisadonnie,Shelter Island,"This is my must go to place when in San Diego. We usally drive there they have several areas with picnic benches and there are bathrooms. Alot of people fish off the pier here. We love to go put our chairs and cooler out and sit for the day watching the ships and boats going in and out of San Diedo bay. Coronado island and the navy base are right across the bay so if your lucky can see navy jets and helicopters doing training excercises., or a navy ship will come in.

ChinaLake1,Visit if you're in the neighborhood,"We were headed to Sunset Cliffs and needed a pit stop and more coffee. It was a little after ten and SD, as usual in comparison to other cities I visit was quiet and relaxed.

colling969,SfN 2018,"Okay so I have a lot to say about this conference but I'll try and keep it short. For those of you who have never been, its relatively overwhelming. Otherwise, it can be a lot of fun. The amount of free swag I accumulated was insane and actually became a little game amongst myself and a few friends. Leisure aside, using the SFN 2018 app lead me to a ridiculous amount of useful information via being able to search just the crucial words and finding which posters were relevant to my research area. At first I didnt appreciated how useful the app would be but my god it was invaluable. The conference center itself has exceptional facilities... I would say over 50 different washrooms, and coffee is available everywhere.",50,San Diego Convention Center,November 2018

Worth a stop",40,ARTS DISTRICT Liberty Station,October 2017
sket101,Great place ,We walked around Liberty Station for a couple hours. We spent quite a bit of time in the visitors building reading the various displays. We wandered through the Market which was amazing. Unfortunately we had eaten before going there so we didn’t try any of the food. The beer garden was also very interesting. The other shops were small and varied. Parking is free and plentiful when we were there. ,50,ARTS DISTRICT Liberty Station,October 2017

There is a hop on hop off shuttle that picks up tourists on the island. If you have the opportunity to rent a bike, there is a path along the water.

Lina102,Spish Splash on the San Diego Bay,This spot is great for kids and adults to get wet on a hot summer day. Watch your timing things don't get started until 10:30 and the fountains of water don't start until 11. There are not a lot of shaded areas since the trees are still young. So bring your pop up tent and lots of water. They also have lots of security guards for both the playground and the splash pad area.,40,Waterfront Park,August 2015

1lostinparadise,Pleasant if there are few people.,"The 4 stars is for the view and my daughter's enjoyment of it.  We've done about all there is to do in San Diego, 10 times over, but I had been avoiding this as long as possible.  Public reclaimed water in which mostly children and homeless people bathe is not my idea of a fun time; however, we were on our way home from a downtown hotel stay, and since my daughter still had on her swimsuit, we made an impromptu stop.  It's a lovely park, and the fountains are nice.  The water smelled heavily of chlorine, but that actually made me feel a little better about it.  We did see one security guard, who said something to some parents about what their children were doing, but he was nowhere to be seen when a homeless man came by to wash his hair and hat.  This is downtown, so it's to be expected to an extent.",40,Waterfront Park,March 2016

GlobalGypsy_13,What fun -- a historic taste of Pt. Loma!,"This green area in the heart of Pt. Loma comes alive with food for the mind, heart, soul, and stomach.  During WWII this was a Naval Training Center (NTC), but now this original village hosts shops, grocery stores, art galleries, museums, cafes. a yoga studio, offices, a brewery, a public market, a movie theatre, and more. Due to multiple lots parking is usually not a problem except on Sundays when the Rock Church holds services. For a taste of historic San Diego with the original California-Mexican buildings, head over to Liberty Station. On the first Friday evening (5-8 pm) of every month, many of the museums and galleries are open, free, and serve snacks. Have fun!",50,ARTS DISTRICT Liberty Station,March 2018

At the Maritime Museum which is its highlight are ships - warships, battleships at berth, the most prominent of which is the Star of India. Father north are life size statues of images of war heroes and veterans and soldiers in a diorama. But the most photographed of all is the gigantic image of a navy sailor locked in a kiss with a lady, who was just so happy he's home. Embarcadero is also home to row of restaurants offering staples for snacks. The best show of all however was free~ that of the setting sun, fiery, unencumbered in the display of its beauty.

Also, most of the outside doors were locked, so we were forced to walk to the very end to get in and then walk back to the complete other end for our events.

If you are an adult who likes any kind of history/geography.... GO!  If you have kids from age 10-20, GO!  This is a private collection of antique maps, including early maps of Europe, America and Asia.  Just take time to peruse the various rooms and try to fathom the discovery of lands and the documentation of new worlds as they unfolded to cartographers in the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.  Amazing!  Special exhibits are also on display in addition to the spectacular series on display from day to day.  We have taken our Scout Troop and the boys have loved it, the docents even organized a scavenger hunt of map trivia and the boys loved that!  If you have an organization that might like to rent out the museum for a private event, consider this location because it is an amazing place that few people know about.

Ian, the owner, travels to Africa on regular basis and brings back real gems. It is always a pleasure to talk to him and to hear him share his passion for what he collects and sells. I bought several items from this store, but the ones I like the most are two batik paintings that are on the walls of my house.

The commentary for each map informs with fascinating facts such as when California was finally acknowledged as part of the mainland and not an island. Do not miss the room that contains a last remaining astrolabe that monks used to plan their day in the middle ages. Large magnifying glasses are available for reading small print on the maps. The friendly staff was happy to answer our questions. The museum is right around the corner from the trendy shopping streets of Prospect and Girard.

Gives good explanations of how map-making evolved through the centuries i.e., maps were not always oriented to North, and pointing out info on the maps which we know today to be inaccurate.  I think the oldest map is from 1471.  The museum has the atmosphere of an old library with dark wooden furniture and cabinets and subdued lighting, even though in a modern building.  It is in the center of La Jolla, easily walkable from anywhere in the village.  Best of all, it is free, thanks to the generosity of the founder.  He obviously put a lot of $$$ into this.

Motogo605,More Than an Arts District,"Liberty Station is near the harbor and covers many acres.  It has lots of shops, coffee shops, eateries, parks, and community events.  It's a great place to take a metal smithing class at Anneville's or to walk or bicycle.  The eateries are not your usual fast food and are delightful with outdoor seating options so that you can watch the local activities.  It also has a huge Von's grocery store that covers two large bldgs. and has a central courtyard.  The parks are lovely and provide space for family events.  ",50,ARTS DISTRICT Liberty Station,April 2019
Montana_Rustler,Very impressive locale,"We were visiting San Diego to see an art show that had one of my wife's paintings in the show.  Killing some time we wandered all around Liberty Station and were greatly entertained by the various shops and galleries and places to eat.  The entire old Navy campus is huge, and we ended up going back to see more of the various places to shop etc.  We were going to eat breakfast at the ""Breakfast Republic"" but the line was out the door and down the hall.  Must be good!!  We did eat at the Market and enjoyed it a great deal.  Frankly we didn't know Liberty Station existed before this visit, but we will make sure to return the next time we visit San Diego.  ",50,ARTS DISTRICT Liberty Station,May 2019
GlobalGypsy_13,What fun!,"In the Arts District of Liberty Station you can find something that appeals to everyone.  For crafters, there's a great yarn shop and Visions Museum that features quilts and nifty gifts. For the aspiring performer, in addition to classes there are performances, especially on First Friday.  Whenever or wherever you go, don't miss the FUN. ",50,ARTS DISTRICT Liberty Station,April 2019
4Bug-a-Boos,What a fun place!,"I totally enjoyed my short visit the Liberty Station.  We actually just meet family here for lunch after flying into town.  So many great dining options, something for everyone.  The our door dining space was great and the food was wonderful.  No problems finding gluten free options here.  Lovely space with a fun atmosphere.  Wish we had had more time to explore but wonderful place for lunch.",50,ARTS DISTRICT Liberty Station,May 2019
Pamela S,Great Restuarnts and Art Museums/Schools,"My favorite is the water color museum which has classes in the art group but there is a public market with tons of vendors, 50 diner, Fig Cafe, Bakery Cafe, and many more restuarants that I want to go back and try.

SweetCaroline619,"Great Dog Beach, but TONS of Bad Dog Owners","If you can come early in the morning or on a random weekday, you might be ok here. But on the weekends the OB Dog Beach is full of negligent dog owners who let their dogs run free while they lay in the sun and ignore them. I have seen and heard of so many incidents of poorly behaved dog owners at this beach that I refuse to go anymore. Dogs will be dogs, but if the owners don't step in there can be real problems. ",20,Ocean Beach Dog Beach,April 2019
Jdicarlowagner,Dogs of Certain Size,The dogs here are much more ill-mannered than at Coronado. Be careful with little dogs. Medium to Big dogs that are well-mannered might just avoid the rude dogs. Not my first choice for under a year dogs.,30,Ocean Beach Dog Beach,August 2019
Duquesadiner,Lovely area for a walk,We came down from the Gaslamp Quarter and walked the full length to the marina which sits on the waterfront. The weather was lovely and there were a few clothing stalls and local artisans selling their work. The place has a relaxed atmosphere and there are some nice boats berthed in the marina itself.,40,Embarcadero,March 2019
SagaloutsTour,Lots To See,"Basically the Embarcadero starts by the USS Midway, takes you past the Unconditional Surrender statue, The Bob Hope Memorial, The Welcome Home statue, right down past Seaport Village, The Marina and The Convention Centre.

keithbU8888PD,A top gallery in the San Diego area.,"My wife and I have been collecting art for 50+ years. Pretty much we've seen it all. This gallery is a must see. We spent two hours there today. Ian knows the stories and history of everything. For him it is all about sharing his knowledge, enthusiasm and passion.  Sure, he needs to sell things. But he is not pushing that. It happens naturally as you learn. This is our second visit and we'll be back. Look at their web site to see the breadth and scope of their collections. ",50,Africa and Beyond,September 2016

John M,Africa on a shoestring!,"No need to visit the continent really when you have this oasis on your doorstep. It offers traditional tribal art with some wonderful masks and sculptures. But, almost more interesting is what the owners are doing which is encouraging modern African artists still on the continent by showcasing their work.  The husband and wife have excellent taste and the ceramic raku works done by South African artists were superb.  There is also a range of African inspired jewelry from all over the world. Well worth a look for anyone and a place to explore and spend time in for Africa afficionadoes.",50,Africa and Beyond,January 2017

77eval,Great staff,"I was recently at a conference in San Diego.  The thing that stood out to me at the convention center was how friendly the staff was.  I expected the convention center to be huge and it was. I expected it to be clean and it was. Expected bathrooms to be easily found and they were.  I didn’t expect such friendly smiles, hellos and have a great day and nice to see you, from the staff stationed at escalators and such. Well done.  Amazing how a smile and friendly greeting can brighten any moment.   ",50,San Diego Convention Center,October 2019
perrypickerign,Conventional Wisdom,The San Diego Convention center is always a fun place to visit and a good place to have a conference. Moderate temperatures year round. Shopping and fine dinning all within walking distance and right by the Gas Lamp district. The convention center has beautiful views and is right by the water. Many things to do include visit the Midway aircraft carrier or go to Sea World or whale watching or deep sea fishing or the world famous San Dieg Zoo...,40,San Diego Convention Center,April 2019
AnLily,Renos and security,"Conferences frequently take place in the Marriott @Marquis Solana, the Hilton Bayfront, and in the Conference Center that is sandwiched in between. The Center that faces Omni hotel and Gas Lamp gate sits directly on the San Diego Harbor, past the Grand Hyatt. It is divided into two massive complexes. The doors A-C lead to one building, separated by concrete stairs and landing from D-H entrances on the East side (tour buses currently depart from E). Until renovations are completed in the West building, exhibit halls are at the G doors, closer to Hilton; all other entrances are basically locked. Security is constantly milling about, even on the remote Mezzanine, except by the Starbucks /snack counter in the same West building. Guards will ask for conference lanyard/identification, simply to access the Center washrooms. Although San Diego is 20 miles from the American-Mexican border, the area of Gas Lamp District feels far from Tijuana. The historic port nearby is where you’ll observe ferries depart for Coronado Island within close view. Airport shared-shuttle can be reserved in advance, in case you can’t flag one down. Per passenger they’ll charge $12-13 USD. To reach the Center by taxi instead, expect to pay $18 USD. (A train extends for the expanse that runs parallel to the Conference Center as well, but you’ll need to catch a bus with exact change or close to $3.50 to reach there.) Expect to do a lot of walking, because the Convention Center was designed with plenty of stairs/escalators and trekking in mind!",30,San Diego Convention Center,December 2019
SBrentP,"Deceptively big, arrive early","Mostly well laid out with clear signage, though the size of it makes it difficult at first.

vicki w,Children's playground on Shelter Island,"There is a great children's playground on Shelter Island that is a good short visit for children.  The ground cover is that spongy material rather than sand like many playgrounds.  Parking is next to the playground and down on a short walk are restrooms.  Grassy areas nearby as well as sidewalk areas for stroller walking, and of course, a great view of the bay and looking back at the San Diego downtown area.

wade376,Great hidden gem!,"My husband and I went here because I teach map skills and European exploration but wow! It is overwhelming g that the man who has amassed all of these maps decided to share them at no cost, with the public! If you are a cartography buff, this is your heaven. If you know little to nothing about maps, it is cool to see such antiquated ideas of the world! California as an island? Many wish but NO! River running east to west through north America? Heaven's no! Christopher, this is not Asia though the map eludes to it! And your drawings of natives? Craziness! But wonderful to examine! Curator was so nice and welcoming and even offered me a magnifying lens to use which was of high quality and allowed me to inspect actual brushstrokes on the pieces. This place was such a find!",50,Map and Atlas Museum of La Jolla,June 2018

db7477,Very nice park on the harbor,Waterfront Park is a nice open space across from the harbor with some nice wading pools and splash fountains. It’s great for families with young kids.

vagabondginger,Fallen Star,Then go down and up the stairs outside to the beginning of the snake path and follow it to the next view of the cottage above. Then take the elevator in the Jacobs Engineering Bldg to the 7th floor and go out to the cottage. It is open Tues & Thurs 11am to 2pm free of charge. Be prepared for vertigo as you enter it.It's an amazing feature of this campus and the views from down below change with different angles. The Bear sculpture nearby is good too. A walk around the campus to see this collection is a hit and miss finds. Not very well marked at all on the maps which are available in the library info desk. But to see the Fallen Star is the main attraction. Google it and make the time to go.,50,Stuart Collection,October 2018
Kitty272727,Hard to see but worth it,"It would help if the guards, the visitors center, the official map of UCSD, and the general signage had heard of the Stuart Collection. A permanent map had a separate list of the artworks by grid numbers, but the map did not have grid numbers.  By chance a Visual Arts student took us to the Stuart Collection office (sign hidden at base of building behind bushes).  With new map in hand we managed to see most of the artworks that were within walking distance. ""Fallen Star"" is a lot of fun, as is the stone teddy bear, the snake path, the metal tree, etc., all by well known artists. ",40,Stuart Collection,January 2019

It is a former Navy Training Center that has been converted into parks, restaurants, shops and little attractions like the base’s former chapel and commander’s house.   All kinds of restaurants, breweries, outdoor patios and shops.

tachyonbb,A must do in San Diego,"Commissioned shortly after WW2 the Midway was converted to an angled deck to handle jet airplanes. The museum was well worth the time and admission.  The tours are well marked and going through the various compartments was quite educational.  Particularly liked the WW2 propeller aircraft, in particular the Devastator, the Wildcat and the Dauntless dive bomber. Attended a lecture by a former pilot and his explanation of how to land a jet aircraft on a carrier was excellent. A great piece of American history and worth a few hours of your time",50,USS Midway Museum,December 2019

alysia79,Interesting piece of history,"If you enjoy history and/or have an interest in learning about how an aircraft carrier operates then this would be a museum for you. This museum allows you to see why life on the ship would have been like as well as exposes you to many types of aircraft. This is a fairly inexpensive attraction in San Diego and if you view and read everything on board, it could take you 3-4 hours to get through it all. I recommend going up onto the “island” which means the command center. This is a guided portion of the tour and is included with the cost of your ticket. The Docents were awesome and you can tell they all love what they do.",50,USS Midway Museum,November 2019

Valeriia2001,Must see!,"I really liked it! It was really interesting. Staff were so kind. It was so exciting to explore USS Midway and aircrafts.

610travelgal,Outdoor Shopping at it's Best,"We live @ 6 miles from  the Las Americas outlets and shop there regularly. It's an outdoor venue so it can get warm shopping in the summer. We arrive @ 10 am when it's still cool. There are plenty of places to get refreshing beverages as you walk. We get great deals and the inventory is not discards from other stores. The Columbia store is one of our favorites. There are many brands name stores. If you're doing big time shopping at several stores, stop by the visitor center and get a coupon book of discounts. The outlets have an attractive Spanish mission feel to them with outdoor seating areas. The store personnel are very helpful and friendly. Be careful if you do google maps, I found the directions confusing. Best bet is to follow the Dairy Mart exit ( going l-5 S), turn right, then left at the next major street, and follow the  road curves to the stores. The outlets are on the border but are very safe, clean, and lovely. Our out of town visitors always request a trip there for shopping.",50,Las Americas Premium Outlets,August 2019
Lebrina2015,Great bargain!,"All American brands are definitely cheap here. You need one whole day to really explore  this place is so huge. I personally go for a big brands so you really can see how much cheaper they are. However as outlet shops are normally operates, they only sell older models.

Gloria W,Great Experience and so Interesting,My husband is retired Canadian Military and they gave him the US Military Price which was more than half off the regular price.   We so enjoyed walking around the midway and listening to the audio of the aircrafts.  They also have men that have served talking and showing videos.  It is in a nice part of the city and what we liked which seemed to make it a real experience was the airport is close by so you can see and hear the planes overhead before they land.  A must if you can is the Bridge Tour.  There is a tour guy for this pert.  So interesting.,50,USS Midway Museum,November 2019
Dweb187,Awesome but one bad thing,Very good Museum lots of neat things the volunteers were very kid friendly.. was going good up until the bridge part when we were not allowed to go because my daughter was 2 inches short was told because of stairs and labiality stuff but then an older gentleman gets up out of his wheel chair and could barley walk was let into that part I think that's more of a lability than a 5 year old that can walk perfectly fine ,40,USS Midway Museum,July 2019

The only thing that has not changed is the old ugly Sears building.  Everything else is brand new.  The ice skating rink is cool.  The cabanas, chairs, and tables outside makes this mall better than many others.  There is also a small stage for performers. We spent a couple hours there.  The Tesla showroom was the hi-light of the visit!",50,Westfield University Town Center,June 2013
Jason L,A cool experience!,"Overall this is a very cool experience that offers a great view into naval aviation history, a great view of the bay and downtown San Diego.

Also, don't forget to check out the ""statue"" dockside. :)",50,USS Midway Museum,November 2019

zsa318,Great experience at a great price!,"Great chance to view history using many senses!  I went aboard expecting to learn a little about the ship, but was happily surprised to discover the amount of interaction that was available was really great!  From sitting in cockpits, to viewing sleeping quarters, and being able to listen to recounts of real life servicemen from the ship.  A must see for anyone visiting.  I was a little surprised that they gave free entry to police and firefighters, but not EMTs and Paramedics, I was planning on paying the very reasonable admission, but was a little surprised that they weren't included.  Other than that, very impressed!",50,USS Midway Museum,November 2019
Tony T,Wow-incredible what you learn,Learned more than I thought I would.  Wife and I attended.  Volunteers great as were the actual vets. Learned so much about the ship and the life on the ship.  People extremely proud.   When you are aboard you don't realize you are on a ship.  It's like a little island.  Absolutely incredible.  Make sure you take the audio tour.  Congrats to everyone involved in the presentation of the Midway.,50,USS Midway Museum,November 2019
krogersku,Arrive Early,The USS Midway Museum opens at 10 AM.  We arrived about 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line for tickets.  Would try to go early and preferably on a day when a cruise ship is not in port.  They do offer a 10% AAA discount on admission tickets.  The audio tour is included in the ticket cost and is very educational.  The museum takes about 4-5 hours to go through with small kids.  We have visited many military museums and this is definitely one of the best.,50,USS Midway Museum,November 2019

Sharron R,Didn't find much at outlet prices.,"We did purchase a watch for my son, but what we had really gone for was Van's shoes and items at Hot Topic.  The Van's shoe store had very little at what I would call outlet prices.  They didn't have a single shoe that would fit my 10.5 size son.  Hot Topic also had no items whose prices were different than a regular Hot Topic store.  The mall is nice, but to get what we wanted we ended up at the Fashion Valley and the Westfield Mission Valley malls that were right in San Diego.  We could have avoided the 40 minute drive all together!",30,Las Americas Premium Outlets,March 2018

C W,USS Midway Museum,"Excellent site to visit!  My bf's father served in the Navy during WWII so it was especially touching for him to see how his father lived in the war days.  So. Much. To. See!  The number of aircraft on the top deck, the SIZE of the top deck, all of the levels and pathways and twists and turns..we could have easily spent more time there than we did if we hadn't had reservations for the Sip and Tour.  One note of caution for those with claustrophobia.  It got a bit dicey towards the end when everyone need to leave for closing time and we were in one of the main galleys.  The ceiling was low, too many people crowding to get out on a one person ladder.  The rest of the tour was funneled very well into open areas and the signs were easy to see and follow.  That end though..whew!  I'd do it again but leave that area WELL before closing time.  Very worthwhile visit!",50,USS Midway Museum,July 2019

It was really interesting to see the staff quarters, it really gave you an insight into life at sea. All the aircraft's displayed on the top deck are amazing, after this we went to the section described as the island, here we had a short talk describing what we would see, and told us to be very careful on the steep step ladders. The control room was really good.  There were many volunteer's around the ship, that were more than happy to answer and questions.  You can easily spend a whole day here.",50,USS Midway Museum,October 2019

Ednorton99,Great museum,"USS Midway is a real naval aircraft carrier which has been made into a museum.  Tour is largely self guided with guided tours available for certain areas of the ship.  Really enjoyed the Battle of Midway film (15 minutes) and looking at the planes on the upper deck.  Knowledgeable volunteers (veterans) are all over the museum and available to answer questions.  You can look around at almost everything on the ship at your own pace.  The enormity of the ship is almost overwhelming.  When in operation, it held 4800 persons on board.  And planes took off from the top deck.  Amazing experience.  Need at least half a day to visit this museum.  Don't leave San Diego without going!",50,USS Midway Museum,November 2019

This is a nice outlet with plenty of good stores to choose from. The place and bathrooms were very clean. Plenty of benches to sit on . Parking was no problem. They had good food and refreshments as well . To me this was nothing great and the prices were only ok . No big sales or anything like that. Both my teenage kids got something each. I liked all the different people that were there and I thought it was cool that Mexico was right across the street. Otherwise nothing special ,30,Las Americas Premium Outlets,August 2017

Linda W,Much variety and nearby shops and galleries under SD Airport flight path,Apparently the Liberty Public Market is a large foodie paradise with probably 100 or more separate establishments under a single roof selling every variety of food.  It is located close to many galleries and shops making it a destination for most everyone.  I particularly enjoyed the nearby Art Visions Museum where a variety of quilts are displayed and the Watercolor Society where a beautiful selection of local watercolor art was on display and for sale.  We prefer to enjoy our meals in a more traditional restaurant setting and stopped for lunch at the Lot which was terrific but the victim of loud aircraft about every 3 minutes.,40,Liberty Public Market,April 2018

It takes some figuring out the first time around but it is a great place to get some interesting bites whether it is an Argentinian empanada or some wonderful desserts or Greek or Thai food.

LouisM565,No Matter What Age You Should Visit,"This is the largest model railroad exhibit in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world. This was my second visit to the museum. The first time I met an employee Brian who took the time to talk to me about the exhibition and to encourage my taking pictures of the individual components of the museum. This time I was fortunate Brian was still there, we reconnected and he explained how the individual elements were constructed and how each replicates an element of San Diego in the late 1940s to the 1950s. Both times I walked away fascinated with what I had learned and several wonderful pictorial memories.

We went to Liberty Square to have breakfast at Breakfast Republic, but the hour and a half wait was a turnoff. We wanted into the Public Market to discover that it's not a traditional market, at all, but rather an eclectic collection of food booths and local vendors. We had a lobster roll at one place, oysters on the half shell at another, and finished up with dessert crepes at a third. Great fun!",40,Liberty Public Market,March 2018

We would have enjoyed it a lot more if our party hadn’t been accidentally spread out over the 3 areas in Liberty Station looking for each other.  The whole place needs better signage and clearer explanations of what happens in each section ... since there are restaurants everywhere.  Also, food arrives in lots of excess packaging.

Kathleen W,A little out of the way Gem,The entrance of the freeway to the outlet mall seems like you're going through a residential area but keep going and you'll drive directly into the mall.

Richard G,"MAINE - incredibly fresh, tasty variety of Maine seafood to enjoy","On vacation Chrtistmas week and luckily stumbled upon the Liberty Station public market visiting from Colorado Springs which has paltry few seafood choices. Being from New England, we thoroughly miss seafood of the Maine Atlantic waters. Well this place hit the jackpot. We even went back. The Captains  Seafood Platter is mored than enough for two with fried whole clams, big portions of beer battered haddock, crab cake, shrimp, and huge portion of French fries with 2 drinks included. It was truly a delight and three workers were even from New England (Haverhill MA, Saco, ME). Nice to chat with - felt like a visit to my childhood home. They should be checked out for a quality fresh feast. Wish they had a place here. I would be a regular. Bravo - Ahoy to you all there. We won't forget you. ",50,Liberty Public Market,December 2017
DarrenChaker_CA,Aircraft Carrier Tour by Darren Chaker,Wonderful place to spend a few hours wondering through through the USS Midway in San Diego.

Maurice d,Not too impressed by this place,My wife wanted to see this place because it got such high ratings. We got there a little later in the afternoon / early evening. There is a lot of food places but (seemed to me) not enough seating. Very crowded and reminded me of the French market in Chicago. It was fun to see for one time but if I head ever back to San Diego I will try to find a different place to eat.,30,Liberty Public Market,December 2017
CTSoxFan,Nice; But Kinda Boring,"As a train buff and model railroad fan, I was looking forward to seeing what they touted as the worlds largest model railroad layout. I don't know what it is, but although the layouts were done very well, nothing really stood out and gave that wow factor. I hate to say it, but it was kinda boring. Maybe for a little kid that likes trains it will be good, but for everyone else I think they will not find it interesting. If you are in Balboa Park and have an hour to kill then I would check this place out. Otherwise, I'd pass and try somewhere else.",30,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,August 2017

SophieBlue09,Wonderful ambiance and fabulous food!,Liberty Public Market is well worth a visit — or five! My husband recognized the military buildings that have been re-purposed as a charming localized vendor market for eating in and take-out. I had pad Thai with chicken and my husband had a Maine lobster roll with fries. We ate in the very cool “Mess Hall” that also includes a pizza restaurant and a bar. The food was super fresh and incredibly good! We went back for croissants to take back for breakfast tomorrow.,50,Liberty Public Market,October 2017

Lobster rolls from Maine ( they were awesome!), Pizza, Thai, Italian with home made pasta, Greek, hamburgers, Mexican, Japanese, Argentinian, Deli Sandwiches, Crepes, Desserts. LOL, we tried several and they were all good!!!!!!!!  Will be back!!!",50,Liberty Public Market,October 2017
Avintosh,"Great atmosphere, lots to choose from","The burgers from Stuffed! were delicious, the patties filled with melty cheese and accompanied by tator tots, the lobster roll was ok, it was just a little expensive for what was served but it wasn't disappointing.  Sitting outside in the gathering dusk was almost perfect, the only challenge was trying to carry on conversations with planes taking off from the nearby airport every 10 minutes and flying directly overhead, but the distraction was not enough to ruin the experience.  We finished the night with drinks next door at Stone Brewing World Bistro and Gardens, the beer menu was extensive and everything we tried was excellent.  Five stars for the ambiance and the variety, if you can't find something you want in the Market there are so many other buildings and restaurants to check out in the immediate area.",50,Liberty Public Market,October 2017

OldBigBob,"Worth a Visit, But ...","This was my first visit to their new location. Much larger, but much was still under construction. A bit boring, and too expensive for what was to be seen. The amount of work was remarkable, all model train gauges were represented, but the presentation seemed incomplete. We planned for at least two hours, but left in less than one.

diningexpert1,A Big Hit with Three Generations of Our Family,"Full disclosure up front; our family loves trains. If you aren't interested in trains, you may be bored. We loved the place.  The seniors didn't want to leave and could have spent another day touring.  The preschoolers were mesmerized but very frustrated by no viewing platforms high enough for them to view the layouts.  Oldsters had to take turns lifting and holding little ones up to glass level.  Strongly urge model railroad clubs to install some boxes for the little guys to utilize to see on their own.  Mentioned this to one of the railroaders and his response was ""fear of liability issues""!?  Someone may fall trying to hold and balance the kids!  Please, let's foster kids' interest in railroading by making it easier for them to enjoy this incredible series of train layouts. Various San Diego Area model railroading clubs display their trains here.  You will see all the popular size track/trains and the layouts are spectacular.  The one kids' room was done up for Halloween and was a five star hit with our preschoolers. Don't miss the outside garden with the replication of the trolley depot and trolley run.",40,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,October 2017
LAExplorer69,Adorable,"I visited Balboa Park on June 10, 2017 with my 2 daughters  ages between 10-15, and my mother. This is one of the many museums in the Park. I thought it looked cute enough but didn't have really high expectations. Happy to say my expectations were surpassed. It was 32 dollars for the four of us, but after you tour this little museum you will feel proud to contribute to help them build such adorable little settings. I did not expect my mother or teenager to appreciate it as much as they did, but you can feel the love and effort the folks here have put in recreating their mostly 1950/1960's worlds. Although we spent between 45 minutes-1 hour touring the displays, I can easily see spending some 2 hours just focusing on the details. My youngest wanted to take on model railroad after we left. They also have a little child play area where kids can press the buttons to make the trains move. Even if you aren't a train enthusiast, I would definitely recommend making this one of your stopping point.",50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,June 2017

RuTut,My son didn’t want to leave!,"This review is based on my son’s reaction. At first, I was a little skeptical and thought the museum might be a little boring. However, my son’s enthusiasm really proved the place was worthwhile and really fun for him. He is 5 years old and loves trains, cars and trucks. He loved looking at the model trains passing through the little towns and over different terrains. There were many different kinds of trains and railroads as well. Since we were there right after Christmas, there was a whole room dedicated to Christmas themed model trains. In that room, there was one train track with an interactive button. My son sat there for 45 minutes pressing the button. He loved watching the train go by.  I wish there were more interactive parts such as this in the museum, however my son seemed to really enjoy himself. I personally liked reading the historical tidbits on the walls. My daughter who is 7 did enjoy the museum at first but got bored towards the end. There were no food options in the museum and you are not allowed to bring in any food or drinks. There is a small shop when you first enter. The museum is located in the heart of Balboa Park, which is pretty amazing itself. Overall, if you or your child likes trains, this museum is definitely a must see.",40,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,January 2018

becw798,Nice museum,This model train museum was nice but it was really expensive to get in. We had recently visited a model train museum in Old Town (much smaller) which was a donation so for this to be $32 I didn't feel it was worth it. We had a San Diego Go Card so it didn't cost us anything and I still thought it was pricey for the average person. If you were a train fanatic it would be a great place. We still managed to spend about an hour there.,20,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,March 2018

They wanted to move through the space over and over and watch all the different scales of trains. I enjoyed it as well. Don’t miss the small outdoor display and the lower level display room. The gift shop is also very nice. Although they were tired from our morning at the zoo they did not want to leave the model railroad museum.

Kristin C,"Unique, interesting","We were in town for a trade show, looking for something to do, as the weather was chilly and the beach wasn’t on the agenda. Took an Uber to Liberty Market; got there fairly early (10ish) so most of the stalls were closed. The guy @ brewery in the mess hall was setting up and was kind enough to pour us a beer even tho they didn’t open until 11. Really enjoyed talking with him and watching the place come to life over the next couple of hours. This is a tiny version of Vancouver’s Granville Island; artsy, interesting food stalls, small, niche stores with unique merchandise. We split the signature dish from the lobster roll stall for lunch; it was delicious! A fun trip to a unique and interesting venue.",50,Liberty Public Market,February 2019

My 4 year old was entertained for a short period....but 1 hour was enough for her, and me.",30,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,January 2019
Rssslwebb,A good quick trip near Balboa Park,These are true model railways with tons of details. We didn’t spend more than an hour there but enjoyed seeing how much time and attention went into crafting these miniature models. They even had a train-themed play area for the littles. ,40,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,November 2018
FredN47,Fun Fun Fun,You can spend a lot of time watching the trains.,50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,January 2019
TucsonTraveller2,Fantastic displays for all ages,"Visited the San Diego Model Railroad Museum for the first time.  Admission is $10 and worth it.  The layouts are huge, all gauges of model railroading.  The O & HO layouts as you walk in are impressive.  As you walk around the those 2 layouts, you come across the HO layout of the Tehapachi Loop; still under construction but operating. Around the next corner is the ""N"" scale layout. Then there is a ""G"" garden scale railroad and the Lionel ""O"" gauge layout.  All are amazing and fantastic.",50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,January 2019
sukhjiwanh,Fun afternoon out,"Several really nice setups here.  Most of the displays are behind glass, but there's a couple you can get really close to.  There's also a new display under construction, would love to visit again to see it finished if I get the chance.",40,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,January 2019
Ivan V,Great deals,Is it easy to get there from San Diego. Short drive with Uber or Lyft. You can find here more then 100 stores. Got some shoes for 30 USD.,50,Las Americas Premium Outlets,September 2018
Joky80,OK shopping,"This is an average outlet mall with many stores. The prices are in the lower range when comparing to other outlet malls and they have nice things in the stores. There also some smaller and local stores instead of only the usual large chains like Adidas, Nike, Converse etc. There are good opportunities to have something to eat or drink in the food court or in the surrounding restaurants in the parking lot.",30,Las Americas Premium Outlets,July 2018
721kaylag,A great outdoor mall!,The only downside is we happen to be here when San Diego/ La Jolla are experiencing some terrible weather so our trips keep getting cut short because it is outdoors. ,50,Westfield University Town Center,January 2016

LaMario C,Nicest Mall in San Diego,"Have to say this mall overall is the nicest in the city of San Diego (yes people La Jolla is not a city and is only a neighborhood in San Diego). Doesn't have the luxury stores that Fashion Valley has but with the improvements and location, seem like they will pose a bigger threat to compete with FV for some of the luxury brands. The food court is one of the nicest I've ever seen and love the ice skating rink inside the court. Nice mall to lounge in or just go on a nice walk around in SD.",50,Westfield University Town Center,August 2015
gzau,Still being updated but very nice,UTC Mall has been undergoing upgrading in the last 2-3 years and is now a very nice mall with more upscale shops and great public area. They are going through an expansion so half of the parking area is dug up and new mall area being built. You should enter through the La Jolla Village entrance and park there.  We like the Arclight cinema and Tender Greens restaurant. Good mall to go to for upscale experience.,50,Westfield University Town Center,July 2016

jeaniej2014,Lovely walk,"It's such a beautiful walk, you won't want to leave. The birds and seals are in their natural habitat and are so much fun to watch. There are Kayakers, paddle boarders, swimmers and snorkels all enjoying the water. Really spectacular. Sometimes the bird smell isn't great, but well worth everything else.",50,Coast Boulevard Park,December 2016
obsoperator,Nice option in massive Balboa Park,"In season (which is very long in San Diego) this is a lovely, shaded garden option. It's a ""lath greenouse"", with no glass, open to outside air, but completely shaded (except the outdoor lily pond, of course.) There are a lovely variety of shade perennials and annuals, and a modest number of orchids. No admission charge, I think. Food and drink not permitted inside. Curvy but level walkways. Near the two main art museums and central circle.",50,Botanical Building and Lily Pond,March 2019

Ward409,While Limit in Scope well Worth the Visit,Not the largest garden but the variety of Orchids was exciting. Plants are well presented. Admission is free . One interesting area was the scent plants where you could rub the leaves and experience the various odors. Interesting. Another area featured carnivorous plants. Well worth the half hour. ,50,Botanical Building and Lily Pond,May 2019

SMGrandma,Food Options Galore,"The 'food court' at Liberty Market is extensive.  Snacks, meals and sweets...all in one place.  This is in addition to the free-standing restaurants at Liberty Station.  I indulged in a spinach/cheese empanada.  Great flavor and nice that it was handheld and I could still walk around while eating.  We shared a beautiful fruit tart, too.  We could have eaten ourselves silly if we had purchased from all the locations that interested us.  Fun place to shop and eat.",40,Liberty Public Market,April 2019
2marcopolos,Fun place to get a great lunch and drinks,Liberty market must have over a dozen food vendors within their walls along with craft vendors selling had make items. The selection of foods were great. Once you get your order their is open seating in various spots in the market. Add a cocktail or beer with your lunch an you will have a great time.  This is a very lively place an I enjoyed the fun time everyone seemed to be having.,40,Liberty Public Market,May 2019
timd640911,What a Surprise!,"If you ask the family, only nerdy old Dad would be interested in something like this.  But we had the day pass for all the museums in Balboa Park, so I talked them in to giving it a quick run-through.  Everyone was impressed with the massive and intricate worlds created by the different train clubs.  If you have the all-day museum pass, it is worth a 45 minute stop.",40,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,February 2019
LivingTheWidth,A highlight,"Definitely a highlight of a recent trip to San Diego.  Soooo much to see.  Since the model train operators were right there, after a few minutes of conversation, I was invited behind the scenes which made the experience all the more enjoyable.  A must see for ANYONE into model trains or young at heart.  I only wish I lived closer.  I'd be there nearly every day.",50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,March 2019
StevenP3559,Rail Fan Paradise!,"The museum offers several different train layouts in various scales, each one operated by different clubs. There is an impressive recreation of the Tehachapi Loop which is located between Mojave and Bakersfield. The layouts are all works-in-progress so many areas will be bare of scenery but give the visitor a sense of how they are built. There are various little humorous scenes tucked within the layouts to keep an eye open for like a girl chasing a dog running away with a chicken after a car accident.",40,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,March 2019
utahartist,Largest Most complete model train exhibit ever.,"The San Diego Model Railroad museum is well worth the price if you enjoy model trains.  They have exhibits on N, HO, O, and G scale trains with great layouts.  Lots of help on hand to explain the layouts.  Over a mile of actual track in the exhibit.  ",50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,May 2019
alicecH3793RF,Train Museum ,"This Tuesday morning we visited Model Railroad Museum located inside Balboa Park in San Diego California. Many students were here too, could be field trips. Lots of model trains, cars and railroad, some trains were moving and kids were very excited to see them. There was also a small garden inside the museum. There is a small cafe for food and drink. A photographic Museum is also in the same building. It was a pleasant to visit this neat museum.",50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,May 2019
Wyverns,Good place to spend the day,"Just like all other Premium Outlets, the stores can have various promotions. Standard food court with average food. Under Armour Store is really huge, so that was nice. There was free wifi, which was helpful. You need to walk a distance to the trolley stop though.",40,Las Americas Premium Outlets,April 2019
Edgar V,One of many great beach choices,"Great spot for a day at the beach. Good amount of grassy areas as well if you're setting up a table/canopy/etc for your picnic and want some space back from the sand a bit. Parking is a challenge, but if you just chill out and/or don't mind walking a block or two it isn't too bad. As mentioned in other reviews the bathrooms are awful, but there if you need them. It's nice that they have a playground for the kids as well.",40,Kellogg Park,August 2016

Maggie K,One of the prettiest sites at Balboa Park,Lovely setting for the botanical building in front of a long reflecting pool with ducks and turtles on the grounds.

Papafish92037,NIce Beach,"Historically, the Children's Pool and La Jolla Cove are more protected, but these have been taken over by seals and sea lions and are often closed due to water contamination",40,Kellogg Park,September 2016
Oldjack,The Best Part Of La Jolla,"This park is quite extensive and has the shopping and hospitality area at its rear and the ocean and is a great place to walk to view the ocean and cliffs, the sea lions and of course the people and activities of which there can be many at the weekend. There is a Number 30 bus from down town San Diego to La Jolla but it does wind through many streets and can take up to an hour but definitely worth the effort.",30,Kellogg Park,October 2016
kurokitty,Our little ones loved the beach here!,"We've been here a few times over the years.

Lifeisonetrip,Under renovation,"Stopped by to do some shopping, unaware they are undergoing a massive renovation where many stores are not open yet and you have to dodge the construction while walking around.  Be aware this is an outdoor type mall, so weather permitting, will be a nice place to walk and stop when the work is finished.",40,Westfield University Town Center,November 2017
Alexandra C,The parking structure is the first impression.Poor directions an no names of places shown.Really nerve racking .,"Went for dinner ,but there were no maps or signs to direct .Finally found. A cleaner who directed us to Lawson's Steak House.Really disappointing experience all around.",30,Westfield University Town Center,February 2018
Hillary B,Waste of an afternoon,"Terrible parking experience, no customer service at theater, and bathroom “train wreck”. Drove 20 minutes to see a matinee and shop. Parking was very difficult, garages were full so we circled several times until we decided to follow someone to their car. This made us 5 minutes late to our movie. Theater is self serve, so no person to help us. We still wanted to see the movie and they wouldn’t sell us the tickets. So we went to shop until the next showing. No bathrooms in Forever 21 so we were directed across the mall to the food court area. My daughter just came out of the bathroom and said “well that was a train wreck”. Long line and a clogged toilet. She had to help a woman in a wheelchair use a regular stall while the handicap stall was out of service. We’re done with UTC.",10,Westfield University Town Center,March 2018
GlobalGypsy_13,Great Sunsets,"The only downside is finding a parking space along Coast Boulevard. Otherwise this area adjacent to the Pacific Ocean offers a place for bracing ocean breezes, stunning views, birding opportunities, and a European-style stroll along the water.

jeaniej2014,Spectacular!!!,"My friends and I meet there for a great walk and breakfast a couple times a month and it's always delightful.

2beans2000,Leisurly loveliness any time of day.... Coastal waves crashing below,"I live in La Jolla and I never grow tired of walking along the Cove and the Coast Boulevard Park.  I think it's always so nice when sunset approaches, to see how many people are gathered, with picnics or cameras or just with a hug around a friend, to watch the sun set from this coastal walk and park.  The timelessness of waves crashing, tides ebbing and rising, and the sun rising and setting... it's mesmerizing.  Enjoy this natural beauty in La Jolla along the Cove and Coast.",50,Coast Boulevard Park,April 2017
ellenbee56,lovely building with rather lackluster contents,"While spending a drizzly day in late Dec. exploring Balboa Park, we checked out this building, since we are garden lovers. It had a nice collection of palms and other tropical plants but really nothing terribly special. I was expecting lots more color, being southern CA, but the only color was from groupings of red poinsettias that were quite faded the day we visited. Compared to other tropical conservatories we have seen around the country, this was disappointing. However, since it's right along the pathway to other Balboa Park sites, it didn't take us out of the way much to check it out. We did get some nice photos of ourselves out front and then moved on.",30,Botanical Building and Lily Pond,December 2018
Tonya C,Beautiful Spot in Balboa Park,"This is probably the most popular (and photographed) spot at Balboa Park.  What’s great about it is that it’s free to explore.

Nature on one side with the coastline, the ocean, the cliffs, the seals and sea-lions, the birdlife, lovely grassed areas. On the other side, the condominiums with their uninterrupted views. It's a relaxing place, just stand and admire the views or find a vacant area of grass to sit and just relax.",50,Coast Boulevard Park,April 2017

So many things are happening around the Botanical Building itself, like the famous fish pond leading up to the building. After entering inside you are transformed into a world of plants.  They change some of the plants depending on the season, so it is fun to go several times a year to see the new displays.  ",50,Botanical Building and Lily Pond,June 2019

JezGateshead,Great place for a lunch with a difference ,Was recommend to visit this place by our Uber driver the night before.

There are many many different stalls of all kinds of food, dessert and some stores and booths like jewelry.

We sat outside and enjoyed a lovely day and good food.",50,Liberty Public Market,July 2019

richarddN5356BE,amazing museum w/ sigificant layouts,"Visited San Diego for 4 days. As a train enthusiast, I visited the museum with my wife. Stayed 3 hours and was awed by the various layouts. They even have an accurate layout of the Tehatchape grade where the train encircles itself..Volunteers are available to answer any questions. They honor military discounts. All sizes of trains are part of the museum like ""O"", ""HO"", N, etc. Loved trains since the early 50's.Would go again.",50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,May 2019
Jeff C,Model Railroad Enthusiasts- Go!,I went with my son is a model railroad enthusiast and I thoroughly enjoyed myself here.  I was blown away by the expanse of museum itself.  I love the fact that it is built and maintained by model railroad enthusiasts who belong to different San Diego clubs and chapters or model railroaders.  The detail on the displays is amazing and certainly worth the time to wander through.  It's also a mini history lesson on San Diego and the surrounding area.,50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,June 2019
P4196NVangelas,A large display,"The exhibitions are very interesting with an accurate scale model of one route. Even a copy of the real billboard from one of the farms is posted on the edge of the display. Do chat to any of the older model engineers, they can tell you a lot of interesting information. It was lovely to see the various clubs contributing to this exhibition and the historical story of the US railroad was well displayed and explained. There is a lovely section for youngsters to enjoy as well....get them to look for the weird passenger on the platform. The smurfs on Thomas the tank and the astronaut on a roof...actually a gas protective suit!  A bit expensive but interesting and accessible to all, even the non enthusiast.",40,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,June 2019

Adrian J,Great shopping area very close to the Mexican Border,"I spent a very enjoyable few hours here.  There is an impressive number of stores.  While not everything is a bargain, my tip is to look for the Clearance or Doorbuster section in many of the stores.  Beyond the outlet stores, there is also a pleasant foodcourt area.  This place is very close to the Mexican border.  It became obvious while I was there that many shoppers had crossed the border from Mexico.  Even some of the shop staff cross the border from Mexico to work here.  As well as the main Premium Outlet buildings, there is another shopping area with stores such as H&M close by, even closer to the Mexican border.  Across the road, there is also a large Ross Dress for Less store.  If using public transport like I did, take the Blue Line trolley to Iris Ave and then the 957 bus, which stops right outside the Outlet mall.",40,Las Americas Premium Outlets,November 2019

There’s a trader joes at one end and some cafes. The actual food part is why I visited and it opens at 10. I finally found it and walked the 20 or so food places before trying an empanada & a bao bun. Both were delicious. It’s a bit out of the way but there are some good things to see and go here. I was solo but I think this was a great family place to go and share some food. There’s some cool shops and restaurants outside and a big bike shop and there’s art galleries. There’s a lot to see. ,50,Liberty Public Market,September 2019

I would highly recommend spending at least an hour here.,40,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,October 2019
Mister-Markie,Amazing . . . just amazing!,"Haven't been here in years, and WOW! What a change for the better it has become! This museum, one of many offered in the San Deigo Balboa Park area, is in the basement of the Casa de Balboa building, and at 27,000 sq. ft., it is the largest such indoor exhibit in North America, and one of the largest in the world. The entrance fee is perhaps more than expected ($12.50 for adult, some discounts offered), but once you step into this world you'll appreciate the upkeep and on-going expenses of these clubs - yes, clubs! There are more than one layout here, and they flow throughout the basement, and beyond. There are N, HO, O and Lionel 3-track layouts. There is also a new (to me!) display room covering the history or the San Diego and Arizona line, and a new outdoor layout, set-up in a small patio garden - so cool! Some of the layouts may not have the detailing of others, but the sheer size and immensity of these layouts keeps you captivated. Some areas are more scenic, to be sure (the Carrizo Gorge area is a scene of beauty and grandeur, even in scaled size!), and the Lionel layout is a cacophony of lights, action and more. There is also a second level covering the Tehachapi loop. And when you are finished, you can take in a nice visit to a well laid out store (admission not needed, so you can visit store for free!). The men and young men manning these trains and minding the layouts are very friendly should you have a question, and don't be surprised if a large creature walks down the main street of a town - it's just a handler re-railing a car or moving an item. I spent 90 minutes here until closing, and probably would have stayed another 30 minutes or so. Whether you are a beginner or a veteran, you'll appreciate the work and thousands of people-hours (over 10,000 just working on the layout on site during weekly work nights) that have gone into this layout. The Carrizo Gorge section took 2 and 1/2 years of labor, and the Tehachapi Pass layout (75 by 30 feet!) took five years to build! The dedication and love of scale model railroading is evident, and if you aren't already bitten, you will be after a visit.",50,San Diego Model Railroad Museum,November 2019

If you are in the park, this is a must see.",50,Botanical Building and Lily Pond,August 2018
grahamt662,Extremely disappointing,Was excited to see this museum from the build up but what a disappointment in reality. Dusty old layouts with meaningless detail  and - worst of all - no trains actually running on most of them.

It reminded me in some ways of the Climatron at MO Botanical Building in St. Louis as it houses many similar plants.  But the architecture and design is incredibly different and interesting.  Looking at some of the climbing plants that reach across the roof is fascinating.  The colors and types of orchids is amazing.  It was a good stop.

Dr. Bob, a retired surgeon, led us on an excellent tour, and he has a bi-coastal appreciation of Kahn since he knew his best building (on the Yale campus).  I learned a lot more about Dr. Salk and a little bit more about the current labs. There are no interiors shown on the tour, except a brief stop in the library and a quick passage through the attic.

It's easy to window shop and/or have coffee, a drink or meal at one of the many sidewalk cafes. The major drawback is the limited street parking available.

Some of these restaurants have ocean views that will take your breath away, and yes, they do cost a lot to dine there but it’s good to splurge once in a while for special occasions . It’s also not too far to walk to beautiful La Jolla Cove.  Parking can be a challenge as this is an extremely popular spot for both visitors and San Diego residents and lots of the restaurants here have valet parking but if you choose to self park, patiently look for street parkings, a lot of them have a 2 hour limit.

Frank-in-SF,Interesting Museum in Downtown Train Station,"This is the second time I've been to this museum.  The building, a former train station,  is bright and its high ceilings create a very open overall feel.  Although it has a permanent collection, it is not on exhibit but rather interspersed within its temporary exhibitions; this makes for a very interesting experience.  The most recent main exhibition was Prospect 2019, in which works under consideration for acquisition were juxtaposed with works already owned by the museum; this created loosely unified themes with thought-provoking variations.  The tour was very good; our docent was very knowledgeable and promoted interaction.  I was here last year for Prospect 2018 so I was familiar with the concept and format.  The two smaller exhibitions were also quite good.  Yes, the museum is small but it does its best to make your visit worthwhile.",40,Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego,October 2019

DavidMarino,A must do in La Jolla,"This has to be the most under appreciated art exhibit on tripadvisor in the entire region. Having lived in the community for almost 20 years, there were dozens of unattractive cinderblock and stucco walls around The Village, particularly given that La Jolla doesn't exactly have the best architecture for commercial and retail buildings. A local art lover and collector, Matt Browar, came up with the idea of doing public art on private property, so they didn't need to compromise the quality of the work and could be a little edgy, and at times controversial. These contemporary art installations all around La Jolla are a perfect opportunity for those that want to enjoy the beautiful outdoor climate, get some walking exercise, and have a wonderful art experience at the same time. It's a great date, or experience to be shared with friends and family. All privately funded by local donors and collectors, this is something not to be missed. There are also curated tours you can take the last Wednesday of every month. ",50,Murals of La Jolla,March 2017

There were many personal collections, letters, medals, etc. which would appeal to history buffs and aviation enthusiasts of all ages.  I also found it to be fairly inexpensive.

Common activities include beach plan (volley ball), swimming, fishing, paddle boarding, water skiing, boating, bike riding, jogging, walking, rollerblading, etc. It has it all.",50,Mission Bay Park,November 2017

_U5249EG,Great historical experience ,"To be honest I thought it’s going to be like any regular historical places you just go and read or someone just tell you a lot of information, but to be honest they catch their attention. I felt like I’m fighting with them because of the decorations.",40,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,May 2018
Zaidtree,Pleasant Surprise!!,We thought we were visiting a regular museum. It was more like an interactive tour through history. The people were so nice. The girls leading our tour were very enthusiastic. There isn't a charge. We tried to give them some money but they would not take it. The girls did an excellent job. It is in Old Town San Diego. Parking can be a little crazy but the museum has its own parking lot for when you are in the museum. Great stop for children and adults.,50,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,May 2018
98maghanb,Quick visit,This place was just okay. I don’t think it is the original battalion site. But what we say was cool. We took just a quick 20 min tour just to check out the place. But there is an official tour every 15 mins which lasts about 45 mins. Free tour.,30,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,May 2018

Otto L,Worth a second visit as lots to see,"We spent 4 hours on a sleepy Monday afternoon at this surprisingly good museum after one gets past the video game aspect of current special Speed exhibit.  The WWI exhibit is extensive, with lots of fulls-sized airplane replicas and movie documentaries where can rest on benches a bit.  Nice aviation Hall of fame bios on wall.  There is a cafe nearby to take a break.  The Apollo 9 exhibit is also great (don't have to go to Florida).",40,San Diego Air & Space Museum,April 2018
SoCalOregonian,TIME YOUR VISIT,To ensure a good experience here time your arrival for  near low tide as to be able to access the pools. There are benches along the shore where you can sit and ocean or people watch. Be advised that parking at times can be problematic at the tide pools.,30,Cabrillo Tide Pools,October 2015
SuperTed19,Uncooperative Tide,"If you are in the area around low tide, it is definitely worth a visit.  Parking is pretty limited, so it helps to arrive early.",50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,August 2016
Evelyn C,Beautiful Scenery,"The drive to the pools is found immediately as you enter the park.  We parked in the first lot and walked up to the second.  The walk was gorgeous and along the way we saw seals, sea lions, and shore birds. The waves were too rough to enjoy the pools, but the scenery was so exceptional we left happy.",50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,October 2016
jkaye42003,Great day of fun with kids!,"We have visited Belmont Park for two years now and we all enjoyed it so much. My kids loved it and had a really great time. Costco.com sells discounted tickets over the summer and they are worth every penny! The tickets are all access passes to all rides and attractions, so with the exception of food/snacks, no need to take out your wallet which I love! Food wise, normal carnival food. Hot dogs, pizza, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, ice cream, and the usual carnival snacks. The park is on the beach so wonderful environment, great weather, really nice atmosphere. We all loved all of the rides at the park. It is a really great place to visit where you can enjoy riding with your children and actively playing with them or just let them go by themselves if they are old enough. The passes give access to all rides, 4D experience, laser tag (so much fun), climbers, and more. We spent a fun filled day there, arriving when they open at 11 and staying until dinnertime. Also, free parking too which is fantastic!",50,Belmont Park,July 2018
clamdiger2,You need to go at minus tide to see tide pool but great place to look at cliffs,We we went at a 2ft  tide not much of a tide pool.  Volunteer said we need to be that at a minus 1 tide.   It was worth the drive the cave was closed when we went.  The views of the ocean after a storm are always great  Nice hike and well worth the stop,30,Cabrillo Tide Pools,November 2016

We then returned to shop in the stores and walk out in the beautiful sunshine! It was fairly cool while we were there but the more we walked it was refreshing!

The gentlman working at the arcade was spectacular and helpfull deffinately an asset. ,30,Mission Bay Park,February 2018

Gkmchardy,A visit to grandpa's attic,"Because there is somewhat limited room and so much stuff, things are naturally in a bit of a jumble. Sometimes it's hard to find the placard that goes with the matching item (two of them I never found, including the mission and pilots of the Apollo 9 capsule). This is important because the museum has such finely made reproductions, you never know whether you're looking at the real thing! There were many authentic originals, however, and even the reproductions are worth it. Every bit of floor and ceiling has something wedged in it, and the walls are covered with models, patches, multi-media presentations, portraits and stories of aeronauts. There is truly something for everyone.",40,San Diego Air & Space Museum,June 2018
YatriForever,Informative and useful .,"Though I have been to a couple of similar museums, I found this quite interesting. It would take about 2+ hours to go through in leisure.

694leann,Unexpected fun,We stopped in on a whim. There is a lot to see. We decided to pay $5 extra to go through the F1 exhibit. This was the favorite part of the museum for them.

Emily H,Fascinating Tide Pools,"The tide pools were very entertaining for all ages. There were plenty of volunteers and park staff to answer your questions. Just be prepared for crowds. Although accessible by foot be the hike is 30 minutes from the top along a road with no footpath. Cars are the easiest option to reach the bottom, but the parking lot might be full on a nice weekend day.",50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,January 2017
Challenger007,Tide Pools (and more) ,"Most people go for the tide pools which is a great reason to visit but go for the amazing view point-possible migrating whales, sunset and other numerous photo ops. This attraction is kid friendly only if your kids are sure footed and mindful..rocks are slippery, the waves can be unpredictable and the access points are a combination of back filled dirt and sand steps and irregular height natural stone. Same goes for the adult visitor. If you are unsteady on your feet or not in reasonable shape do not bother to descend far off the main trail. Plan your visit around the low tide if you want to experience the pools. One hour prior to low tide is optimal. Don't miss the sand stone cliffs and caves just north of the main tide pool area and don't forget to use your admission to re-enter the park again since your ticket allows one week access to properly experience the ever changing view.

jrk9789,"Tourist, Tourists",A pretty little dockside tourist spot. There’s a decent pricy restaurant for lunch or dinner.

The fish place at the food court has really good fish & chips. This trip, many shops were already closed up, too bad. They will probably put in more high-rise buildings.",40,Seaport Village,June 2019
Craig1961_01,Seen better days,"As many others have commented, this is a tourist spot from past days on it’s way out. Pity, as the seaside views are nice and some of the bars/eateries look ok. Too many souvenir shops and with the ridiculous parking charge, death is inevitable! Make sure you at least get a drink to validate your parking ticket and then don’t pay at the machine, it didn’t recognise our validation. Best to pay the guy stood on the exit barrier, got our parking for 5 bucks as it should be.",20,Seaport Village,June 2019

West-Field-Trash,What a lovely day!,"We happened on this place when we were killing our last day in San Diego.  The drive up to the tide pools is amazing and very humbling as you drive by a military cemetery.  It's a bit of a trek to the pools, there are decent bathrooms, at the beginning, although they are of the ""National Park"" variety.  Lots of people there, even though it was high tide.  Great photo ops.  Lots of people with dogs (on leash).  My Verizon phone kept messaging me ""welcome to Mexico"" so I assume we were pretty close to the border.  You can see forever.  You have to pay a $10 toll to get into the park.  I would assume parking would be kind of a pain during low tide.  We plan to go back next time we are in town, I met a science teacher who told me that the tide pooling is fabulous, and sometimes you can see whales offshore so bring your binoculars.  Bring a picnic and water, we deffinitely got in our 10,000 steps by hiking around the area.",50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,February 2017

My son didn't like the coaster because it was too loud and it made him hit his head.  I think it looked fun but I didn't get a chance to get on.

Along the way, there was even a taco and tequila festival going on when I was there. There's also the port from which the Coronado Ferry leaves (another activity that I recommend).

It was about a 45 minute presentation that kept our family, including 3 young kids, captivated. I feel it was one of the best LDS museums that we've been to. The building was new but made to feel old, the workers were knowledgeable and so friendly. My kids loved panning for ""gold"" at the end of the presentation.

The girls showing us round were so knowledgeable and sweet. I wanted to give a donation at the end but they don’t accept anything. My husband was reluctant as he didn’t want to be preached at, but there were only gentle references to the modern day Mormon organisation. ",50,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,August 2018
JeanieKK,So well done!,We took the tour with 2 great missionary tour guides. They were so informed and gave an excellent tour! It’s an interactive tour so young children enjoyed it too!

MapGuy414,Educational fun afternoon,We love airplanes and this place is full of them inside and out. Real airplanes fly over head every few minutes as they land at Lindbergh field. We watched about ten airliners come in. The displays and example aircraft in the museum are so historical. You could walk through in an hour or stop and read and take in all the stories in two to three hours. We were closer to three. Great photo ops and family bonding time.,50,San Diego Air & Space Museum,July 2018
Steve B,For the Sand Averse,Took my teenage son who doesn’t like the beach here while the family was on the surf. Fun aircrafts and great place to learn about the history of aviation. We also did the car race simulators. Great fun. ,50,San Diego Air & Space Museum,July 2018
pudman43,"Wonderful museum, enjoyed it immensely","Some great displays, including a Gemini capsule - and Lindbergh's 1927 Spirit of St.Louis plane - right as you walk in.  Very nice WWI area, plus WWII as well:  Hellcat, Corsair, ME109, Mustang, Spitfire, PBY, others.  A few holes in the displays, but you can't have it all.  Wish we'd had more time to linger.  Also, here is a small but moving 9/11 display there as well",50,San Diego Air & Space Museum,July 2018
290kend,Quality museum,This museum had many replicas of airplanes from the early 1900s through WWII. There was an exhibit on the “99” women’s group. A space exhibit is also there. ,40,San Diego Air & Space Museum,August 2018
DannyWasserman,The tide Pools of Cabrillo !!,My son recently took me to the monument of Cabrillo and he recommended toe tide pools.  This is a spectacular event that happens on a regular basis.

expat_mbk,Fun! Beautiful views!,"$10 for entrance into the National Park (or if you walk or bike in, it's $5 each). We didn't see anything much in the tide pools, but there's a beautiful walk with great views! I was told that it's important to go a bit before Low Tide. Sensible shoes would be good for the walks, but I was fine in flip flops. Free parking lots. ",50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,April 2017

Cathy R,Old Fashioned and Fun,"Old fashioned amusement park - historic and bone-shaking roller-coaster, plus an amusement arcade and some other rides.  Plenty of places to spend your money.

bkbkg,Great for younger kids,"We visited with our 15 year old daughter over fall break in October. We enjoyed the park, but felt younger kids would enjoy it more. The park was not very busy and we were told we might have to wait for an attendant for some of the rides. We never waited more than a minute or two. We were given arcade cards due to a ride/attraction not operating. We had fun playing in the arcade, but had trouble finding something to spend our tickets on as the prizes were geared towards younger guests. We also played Laser tag by ourselves as there were not others around to join us. Would have been more fun with more people. We especially enjoyed our dole whips!",50,Belmont Park,October 2018
JessVett,Had fun,We had an ok fun time with our three year old twins. It was under construction so I think we’d have a better time when they’re done. It’s convenient and they had great rides for a range of ages. The lines were really long for the ice cream shop so we didn’t get to try the only “food” we went there for. My kids didn’t want to leave. ,30,Belmont Park,July 2018
Roadrunner2652,Belmont Park,We took our grandkids 4 and 7 for some fun.  Unfortunately there are just a very limited amount of rides for 4 and 7 year olds.  The escape room was too pricy at $140 for 4 adults. Overall I would rate this park at best an average.  Save your money and go to Lego Land which is geared for young children.,30,Belmont Park,November 2018

There are stores for clothing, shoes, makeup, toys, home goods, and even cooking! There is basically something for everybody.

lindyhopper63,Wonderful and memorable trip,"Stayed with my friend in Mission Beach. We went bicycle riding all around Mission Bay and had a great time. The boardwalk was crowded, so you do have to be careful and watch where you are going. We rode down to the jetty in Pacific Beach; then crossed over and rode along the bay side back to Mission Bay Park. We stopped in at The Pennant and had 'happy-hour' cocktails while Charlie, the Bartender entertained us. We had a great time!",40,Mission Bay Park,March 2018

texasdonna77,Slow moving seniors need to watch out!,"The boardwalk would have been delightful with just walkers and runners, but add bikers and skaters and hundreds of electric scooters and it's not so great. I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped to, and as a slow-moving senior, it actually scared me. But if you're good at dodging moving obstacles, you might find it enjoyable.",30,Mission Beach Boardwalk,November 2018

Kenisha J,Beautiful Clean Beach,Went here and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  The weather was sunny and breezy but that didn't stop my friends and I.

cortp,Good family fun,"We visited on a very warm September day. We were able to start a tour within 5 minutes. They had cold water and clean bathrooms we could use. The tour was surprisingly interactive and funny especially for our two young kids. It was very informative. At the end you get to pan for gold, take a Polaroid picture, and climb a few flights of stairs to see the few of Old Town. Overall a great way to cool off and take a break. We were there for a little over an hour. I would recommend for families and those interested in California and western US history.",50,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,September 2018

MarcusandKimmy,Do your homework first,Awesome place to take your kids. Be sure to do your tide schedule homework first though so that you're visiting close to low tide and not a couple hours after. And bringing water shoes and towels will make it even a greater experience. ,40,Cabrillo Tide Pools,October 2017
bryan8underwood,Beautiful,My wife and I drove here to see the tide pools but they were not visible due to the weather and high surf that day. It is still a peaceful area to sit and watch the sea though. If you you at the right time the sunset would be absolutely stunning. It provides an unobstructed view of the sea as far as the eye can see. Beautiful. $10 per vehicle to get in.,50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,November 2017

KasineeG,Go at low tide,"The tide pools were so fun to visit! It seems like a great activity for visitors of all ages. We had a great time exploring and searching for wildlife. We found sea anemones and sea slugs, and heard of other people finding star fish and an octopus. I recommend going at low tide, otherwise you won’t be able to find as many creatures.

This is where the ""Star of India"" tall ship is located. As you walk south the is the USS Midway Museum (WWII Aircraft Carrier), several memorial/monuments and San Diego Information center. At the southern end is the Seaport Village with dinning, retail and beautiful views of the Coronado Bridge. The one thing I love about the San Diego Boy Walk along the Boardwalk is the sitting areas all along, beautiful landscaped and you can sit and watch the people and scenery. It gets 5 stars since this is one of the few public venues that have a prominently located, semi-clean PUBLIC RESTROOMS!! BONUS!

SuperDuperCoach,"A surprise packet, worth a visit","Was expecting a few rooms of artefacts and stories on posters on the wall, it isn't anything like that. We were greeted at the door by two young girls (maybe late teens early twenties) in (lets call it) period costume. We then got a personalised tour (scripted performance synchronised with the videos) through various rooms with sophisticated A/V and professionally made videos (complete with sets of portraits on walls carrying on conversations). Each room had had heaps of money spent on the setting and the A/V, and it chronicled the story behind a bunch of Mormons agreeing in Iowa to march to San Diego and fight the Mexicans, and then the struggles they faced through the journey. We were uncomfortable at first but after a couple of rooms we were ok. In the 40 minutes there would have been 7 or 8 god references (“god will see us through” and “their faith gave them strength”) plus one statement like “if you would like more information please fill out this card” but it really wasn’t over the top. I guess it was, historically, a minor event, so to have spent all that money on the A/V it is obviously a propaganda exercise, but it was an experience that’s for sure, and one worth having.",40,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,October 2018
Sue R,A terrific experience -- totally unexpected,"This is a great museum,  with friendly hosts for a personal touch,  but with very up-to-date technology.

It then skips to the space program and shows an actual capsule and various items related to the space program. It was a great show.",40,San Diego Air & Space Museum,October 2018

EscoDave,Excellent place to explore the San Diego coastline,Below the Pt. Loma Lighthouse is a park of the National Park that should not be missed...the Cabrillo Tide Pools.  Take the road to the right down from the top after entering the park and park in one of three parking areas which allow you to get out and explore the tide pools.  Check out the low tide times before coming for the best viewing.  Excellent views of the San Diego coast line and the off shore Coronado Islands.,40,Cabrillo Tide Pools,March 2018

However, the beauty and peacefulness of the place under a bright sunny day with that spectacular view, somehow can be taken as a great way to spend eternity. Worth the visit",50,Fort Rosecrans Cemetery,December 2018
Tina Q,Stunning sunset!,"I visited this beach by way of the Torrey Pines Glider Port Trail, which leads to the infamous Black's Beach, a clothing optional beach. As it was later in the afternoon I didn't wander too far. There may be a section with more nudists, but at this spot there were very few, and it seemed to be fairly family friendly. The trail down to the beach isn't for everyone. It is steep but I managed it without too much difficulty (I'm 58). The trek back up was a different story. I had to stop several times to catch my breath, and I wasn't alone. Younger folks than me took breaks on the way up. The sunset was spectacular, though, and well worth the trip.",50,Torrey Pines State Beach,January 2018
I8416KBrichards,Great walking trails,"I’ve been here often, both at the beach and on the walking trails up the cliffs.  It’s a great beach and great ocean views on the trails. It only gets 4 out of 5 for two reasons.  One is the parking.  There is street parking, but if that is full, the beach parking is $12 Monday thru Thursday, $15 Friday thru Sunday, and $20 on holidays.  Two, is it gets crowded.  Like Yogi said, no one goes there anymore - it’s too crowded.  And one last thing, it gets rocky in the dead of winter when the sand gets taken away by the surf.  In summer it’s all sandy.",40,Torrey Pines State Beach,February 2018

Dapper54,To do....,"Staying in San Diego recently, had researched online and Belmont Park was one of the must things to do! And, I would agree! This is a small amusement park, going back ole school and right near the beach and water! Is really small so a half day is long enough to spend her, if a half day..Maybe more like 3 hours or so! A lot of eateries surround the park and the ocean and beach are located right behind it if you want some sand and sea as a respite from the rides and games..! and entry is free...!",30,Belmont Park,December 2018
jwade2008,Neat spot,Be sure to get there at 11am for the rides to open but neat spot - right on the boardwalk by the beach. The roller coaster just cost $7 to ride. No cost to walk around in the park with plenty of parking. We went on our way to La Jolla,40,Belmont Park,March 2019

Michael P,Venice Beach Miniature,"If you have seen Venice Beach near Santa Monica, then Belmont Park in San Diego is like that but smaller with carnival rides.  It's California schtick in it's finest.  Bring your wallet because there is not a reasonably priced meal or item in sight.  For example, it cost $21.00 for 3 tickets for a 2 minute rollercoaster ride; $30.00 for 3 tacos and an enchilada (you get the picture). But, you can't see it anywhere else (once is enough).",30,Belmont Park,March 2019

They enjoyed the Lego store and a few of the other toy stores but they hated the walking and the fact that it was super hot and the sun was beaming down on them. This outdoor mall is clean, food court is crowded but I believe that is the case at every mall lol. There were a few hand sanitizer stations placed outside due to the recent hepatitis A break out so that was a cool precautionary measure. There is a small playground area for kids. The only negative thing about this mall is that the food court is open as well and there were birds flying around and bird poop in various areas of the food court  We went elsewhere to eat but aside from that, it's definitely a good place to shop.

J C,Honoring the military,"It amazes me that many reviews state that this is just a cemetery.  While they are stating the obvious, it is special in that many of those buried here died in the service of their country so that others could be free to visit where ever they choose.  It is a place of scenic beauty, respectful silence and where many families come to visit loved ones. It is a stop that it is easily made on the way to Cabrillo National Monument and tide pools.  For those that want the scenery without the cemetery, try the Veterans Memorial on Mt Soledad.",50,Fort Rosecrans Cemetery,October 2018

We have been there many times especially when family come to town it is on the bucket list and a great place to overlook San Diego and Coronado.,50,Fort Rosecrans Cemetery,August 2018

SoCalOregonian,IT IS AN OK BEACH,"Do not expect a pristine white sand beach but the beach is OK, except during high tide. Today the high tide was a +4.6 and took away all but about 18 feet of usable beach. So, if you get here at low tide find out how high the tide will be and stake out your claim accordingly. The other drawback to this beach is it is rocky the further south you go, so stay on the northern side if possible. It also costs $15 to park in the south lot, unless you are lucky enough to get a free spot along N. Torrey Pines Road.",30,Torrey Pines State Beach,July 2017
john g,Lifeguards on duty,"The park has lots of pay parking nearby, if your patient, you can get a free space on Hwy 1 feet from the beach. You can hike up into the park, if your in good shape. At low tide you can hike south to Black's beach, a nude beach. But check the tides, because you can't get back at high tide.

Paid extra for the “speed” exhibit but not sure that was worth it.... although my 8 year old loved “riding” the motorbikes!  The Apollo capsule was a highlight. ,40,San Diego Air & Space Museum,November 2018

The drive there itself is scenic.  Parking  along the beach is free but it’s not always easy to find one as folks tend to come early. There is a paid parking lot towards the end of the beach.  It’s a great beach getaway for the family.  It’s also one of the most beautiful places to observe a Californian sunset.  Consider visiting the Torrey Pines State Natural Reserves as well since it’s just next door and just a short hike up.",50,Torrey Pines State Beach,March 2018

kathy w,Beautiful beaches and views,Convenient to access - a good way to start your nature hike or end it. I've done both and really enjoyed being able to just get off work and head over to wind down my day with a beach walk.

bramk91,Good mall in San Diego,"I visited this place twice during my visit in San Diego. The place was very easy to reach by using green trolley. The trolley station and the bus station is just in front of the mall. Within the complex, there is AMC cineplex, various branded stores and a food court.

This one is on the higher end, with stores such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Burberry, Hugo Boss and anchors like Nordstroms, Nieman Marcus and Bloomingdales.  They have the typical mall stores too like Banana Republic, Forever 21, Victoria's Secret too with a Macy's and J.C. Penny.

The water in the bay is relatively calm but if you need waves, you can always hit Mission Beach right next to it.  There are also lots of paths to jog, bike, roller blade and skate board.

Lyndoski,not historical but Mormon recruiting tool,"The ladies who greeted us were very nice and we were ushered into a room for an intro and then ushered into another room (with very uncomfortable seating) for a highly produced film, which was more about the faith that the Mormons had rather than historical content and proselytizing.  Good for them but not what we expected.  Truly it ws creepy and we felt kinda trapped as someone was standing at the door but we did manage to slip out early.  Cannot understand the glowing reviews for this attraction. ??  MAYBE very small kids would be entertained by the film and the panning for gold.

Tide pools are best seen at low tide, so check the San Diego paper for low tide that day.  The tide pools themselves are right at the waters edge, and there are rock ledges above the pools where you sit and watch the animal life.  While we were there, we mostly saw small crabs in the pools but sitting there with the waves crashing below us was super enjoyable and peaceful.

StevenJacean,Fun at Mission Beach ,This is a fun boardwalk amusement park right on Mission Beach. The only bad experience was a ride breaking down while we were in line waiting for over an hour. We got ride tickets at the park and purchased too many. There weren’t many rides we wanted to try (as adults) that used tickets and an unlimited ride pass wasn’t worth the price/amount of time we wanted to spend. The tickets are non refundable but they don’t expire - so you can always come back. In hindsight - we would have looked at the rides we wanted to ride first - purchased a lower amount of tickets and used the remaining cash on the boardwalk games (cash only.) The food was great and we had dinner at Cannonball - great food with roof top views of the ocean. ,40,Belmont Park,April 2019

You can get in for free, but pay to ride the rides and participate in the other activities.  We really enjoyed our day here and my kids really wanted to come back a different day, but we didn't have the time.  The corn dogs were homemade which were great.  They had a nice ice cream and sweet treat shop there as well.  The games were fun too, and the workers helped us out when one of our kids had 1 less win, but gave him the same size as his sister which was much appreciated.

We had lunch at California Pizza Kitchen. This is a nice mall, with a lot of choices. There was a long line to get speciality coffee and at the Nordstrom’s Cafe. Today, this mall was very busy.

Whitefox100,Still a good place to visit but not as good as it was 4 years ago. ,"We like the place and recently ate in a different but great restaurant every night, however the shopping experience has seriously declined over the past few years, indeed would appear that the area is facing the same post internet problems as locations across the western world. The shopping is mainly niche crafts or t-shirts ands other tourist crap",40,Seaport Village,September 2019
emmabigge,Fun place to hung out,"Seaport Village is a fun place to visit, a little bit everything, shops for low and high end things, good restaurants, water view and sports to watch or just sitting on the bench relaxing under sun .

Martin S,Spanish & Catholic History ,This mission is supposed to be the first established around 1775. Good place for history and pictures.,40,Mission San Diego de Alcala,September 2018
TimDore, Beautiful restoration of the first of 21 California Missions,"Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcala is easily accessible with plenty of parking. There are stairs to get from the lower parking lot to the Mission but you can also park above. Additionally you can walk up the left side from the lower parking lot where there are no stairs to navigate just a not very steep roadway. It is a beautiful restoration of the first mission founded by Father Junipero Serra. The mission was established near the Presidio in 1769, but it was moved to its current location in 1774. When I was there a funeral was going on so I was discreet in visiting the church. The grounds are very nice too. I highly recommend a couple of hour visit. ",50,Mission San Diego de Alcala,September 2018
itcheetam,"Very detailed and complete mission, great for mission report for school kids!","I was very surprised to visit this mission as it is the first mission. The ground was well preserved with a nice organized museum, excavation ground and beautiful gardens. It also has a room with furniture and display as in the old days. The ground is very well maintained with flowers, fruit trees and greenery. Many sculptures and the adobe church building is nice too. Admission is $5 and senior is $3. It is still an active Catholic church with daily masses. I really enjoyed the visit and had wonderful pictures. Many parking available.",50,Mission San Diego de Alcala,September 2018
JackofPBFL,Beautifully restored,"Having visited quite a few of the California missions, this was a bit disappointing but nonetheless beautiful. The garden was very nice as was the church. We probably would have gotten more out of it if we had taken a tour or rented the audio guide. They have a small but interesting museum. The gate into the parking area was closed, so it was a climb up the stairs to get in.",40,Mission San Diego de Alcala,September 2018
TOOTMOLLY,What a Beautiful Mission,If you are Mission Hopping this is a great place to go.  The history is amazing.   I would try to go early in the morning as this is a popular place to have weddings.    You wont regret your visit.,50,Mission San Diego de Alcala,October 2018
Alicia F,They seemed to stretch the truth with this one...,"Overall, the tour and production were very well done and interesting, the facility was very clean, and the staff were very nice.  HOWEVER, they seemed to take a lot of historical license with the facts presented.  Everything was explained to give the impression that the Mormons brought civilization to California. They did not.  They claimed that the Mormons discovered gold at Sutter's Mill. They didn't. James W. Marshall discovered the first gold, and as far as I can tell, he wasn't a Mormon.  He may have had some Mormons working for him. They claimed to have started the first newspaper in California.  They didn't. The first newspaper was The Californian, which began in 1846 in Monterey, and moved to San Francisco in 1847, the same year the California Star was begun in San Francisco by Mormon Sam Brannan. They mentioned in an opening film that some Mormons arrived to California by ship and ""the locals were amazed at what they brought with them,"" which were vegetable seeds, books, and a printing press, as if the Californios had no idea how to plant vegetables or read books.  As a descendant of the original Californios, I found that bit to be particularly insulting.",20,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,February 2019
HawaiiStateofMind,Fun for the whole family and very educational," I commend the LDS Church, they did a great job on this historical site. And they don't preach at all they're just there to tell the history.  If you're in town, everyone especially if you have children would enjoy this.",50,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,January 2019
gaylerae,Wonderful visit,Stop here when you visit Old Town. It is well worth your time. I was worried that it was too advanced for our family of young children but they enjoyed it very much. Our son got to dress up in what the battalion wore and got to pan for gold. He also loved touching the old cannons. We got a fun cute historical picture as a family. I didn't know much about the Mormon Battalion other than it existed. I learned so much from the presentation. I loved the time I spent here and the missionary volunteers were exceptional.,50,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,February 2019

barbgal,Go here first,"I got to this museum by accident, I asked the driver for the (historic) park, and he drove me here and pointed to the park on its side.  But I was thrilled to see it, I had not seen it in any guidebooks.  The Mormons had a significant impact on early California, and this place documents that little known fact.  Plus, the history is presented in such a manner that all the kids were spellbound.  They do a fantastic job of telling history to all.  They do not proselytize so do go.",50,Mormon Battalion Historic Site,February 2019

beachbird123,Air Travel A to Z!!!,A beautiful museum located in Balboa Park. The collection is so extensive it is overwhelming.  I am sure that you could learn something new every time you returned to go through it.  Lots of docents to answer question but very easy to tour on your own.  No matter what part of travel you are interested in they have it there. The admission price is comparable to any museum of this nature and easy to get to.  Fun and educational no matter what ages are in your group. Great place to picnic after touring museum.,50,San Diego Air & Space Museum,May 2019
Debi Y,Small,We have seen many air museums and were a bit disappointed in this one. Being in San Diego and having so much military around we thought it would be much larger.  It’s also hard to see when 2 layers of planes hanging over your head. ,30,San Diego Air & Space Museum,May 2019
Traveling91012,Good for adults and kids,"My entire family really like this place. There are some interactive exhibits that the kids (and adults) liked, there’s a separate kid’s room where kids can play with flying airplanes, racing cars, and more, there is a photo op set up with an astronaut suit. There was also a guy (temporarily) at a table with a space lander challenge craft for kids to do; he said they do a similar one during the summer program. My son really liked it and asked for me to find more things like this for him to do. They definitely piqued his interest in STEM activities and he has been telling all of his friends about it. This little table with the alien challenge (like the egg drop challenge) was probably the highlight for him, he’s 8, and he has now gone online to find summer programs where he can learn more engineering and building types of things. This is also a great place for any adult and child interested in the history of flight or anything flight and space related.",50,San Diego Air & Space Museum,May 2019
ransom007,"Great air & space museum in Balboa Park, San Diego, California","The museum has free parking. It is located in Balboa Park next to the San Diego Automotive Museum, if you want to hit two museums with one trip. After paying your admission fee, you enter the museum through a hall lined with pictures of prominent parties involved in air and space development. Other portraits and photographs are scattered throughout the museum's exhibits. The exhibits include many aircraft from early ideas to space craft. They have several specimens of World War I and World War II aircraft and many others. It is an excellent history of the subject matter. You, of course, exit through their excellent gift shop.",50,San Diego Air & Space Museum,May 2019

Now due to all the motorized vehicles, specially scooters, that are permitted for all ages, it is just plain dangerous for pedestrians.  I read the city was trying to make and enforce rules to make it safer, so I hope that happens soon.  Even just crossing the boardwalk to get to the beach was hazardous.

treyk453,Good way to kill an hour.,Went with three kids under ten and they had a good time. The location in the Cabrillo National Monument site allows for other things to do as well. These tide pools were not as expansive as the ones in La Jolla.,50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,March 2019
Mark Z,A nice little walk from The Lodge Torrey Pines,I stayed at The Lodge and went out for a run.  The staff pointed me in the direction that I could get to the beach.  Some of the path to get here was paved and then it turned to trails once inside the park.  The path was well marked and it led to some stairs that took you right down onto the beach.  Round trip from The Lodge was approximately 4.5 miles.  Well worth the effort (especially if it is winter where you are from).,50,Torrey Pines State Beach,December 2018
Nancyuen,"At the Foot of the Cliffs, This Beach is a Great Place to Land on a Walk Through the Preserve","We walked down the path from the Preserve (located on top of the cliffs) to this beach, which wasn't terribly crowded at the time.  We walked along the beach to the entrance to the park, where we turned and re-entered the park.  There are no beachfront facilities (like at La Jolla Shores or La Jolla Cove), but for a walk up the cliffs, one can reach the porto-potties at the top.",40,Torrey Pines State Beach,June 2018
joemW8062WV,San Diego Treasure ,Torrey Pines State Beach is one of the most beautiful places in the West Coast if not North America. It is a 10 minute drive or a 45 minute leisure bike ride from my house on Ted Williams Parkway (56). Nice walk from street parking if you do not want to pay the entrance fee. Plenty of cafes along the way. Great family activity. ,50,Torrey Pines State Beach,December 2018

We didn't know what it was or whether our passes would cover the costs once there.  To our surprise it was the best day of our trip.  My grandkids (6-16 yrs) ALL loved it.  The climbing wall was a huge hit as was the ropes course and mini golf.  We played lazer tag as a family (Kids vs. adults) and it was a blast.  I would highly recommend Belmont Park to any family looking to spend a day playing together.  A good time was had by all!,50,Belmont Park,July 2019

The all day ride pass is the way to go for this place. Belmont Park is pretty much on Mission Beach. The rides were pretty good and it's not that huge that you could get lost or have massive line ups. We loved the fact that you can go in and out as you please. There are lots of food places about a block away and the prices there are not jacked up like they would be around the other large theme parks. After a late lunch, we went for a swim and came back for a couple more spins on the roller roaster before heading out.",50,Belmont Park,August 2019

Instead, they really were exquisite deep-fried (ever so lightly!) soft goat cheese balls!  I was blown away by them, and crumbled onto the salad of heirloom beets dressed the greens to perfection!

In the Gift Shop, the attendants told us to wander through the museum and grounds without paying. we quite enjoyed the small museum and the contemplative nature of the grounds.

iluv2eatntravel,A joy to explore,The natural environment here is a joy to explore with hiking trails and side roads leading to beautiful views of the oceans and sea cliffs. Probably the best way to get here is to side street park along La Jolla Shores Dr just after La Jolla Farms Road and hike down (yes the hike back up can be more challenging than the hike down but doable).

jake6K6,Memorable,"I've rated this place a ""3"" because I don't encourage tourism at military cemeteries, but it is an impactful, honorable site. For those of us who have family/friends buried there, it's a tribute to their lives. Most people drive right past it to/from Point Loma, but if you are inclined to stop for a few minutes to honor our servicemen and women, and appreciate the views as well, it's well worth the time.",30,Fort Rosecrans Cemetery,October 2019

Dick P,Good museum covering a broad range of topics.,"This museum has breadth rather than depth. It covers aviation from balloons to space exploration, but in doing so it covers some areas in a rather shallow manner. It is particularly weak in the area of military aircraft post WWII. It does have a lot of very early aircraft through WWI and quite a bit on space travel.",40,San Diego Air & Space Museum,November 2019

jredwood,Beauty and exercise for nature lovers,"One of our favorite spots to take guests to San Diego. At the end of the Point Loma peninsula, this beautiful nature preserve has walking trails along the coast. During whale season, you can watch them go by, seeing their water spouts. Up the hill, there is a viewing area as well, and it's close the the Cabrillo National Monument which is also a great place to visit for a view back to the city and Coronado Island.",50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,October 2019
AlexaS365,Bring kids or not.... Great place to explore...... Watch Sunrise or Sunset,"we come here every chance we can.  During low tide you can explore the tide pools spotting crabs, urchins, starfish all sorts of things.  Must watch tide info line.  You need to be able to get down safely but once down its so much fun.  One thing to be aware are the signs regarding seashells...they Ask that you leave the shells for the crabs looking for new homes.  Along the wall you can see crabs climbing into the nooks & crannies to hide while the tide is down.  During high tide you can walk the paths and look out and sometimes you can spot surfers, Navy ships cruising by, whales migrating south and on very clear days you can see the Cortez Islands. You can bring your dog but always remember to pick up after them.  There are two look out points that you can drive to for some nice pictures.  Along the walk path there is a bathroom along the way.  This area is not handicapped accessible due to the dirt pathways and some climbing and steps.  The area is clean and don't forget to bring your water.  Great sunsets if you want to stay & watch it.  No shops or restaurants.  ",50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,September 2019
cheese4me,Slippery When Wet,"Very easy to access, a short hike from the parking lot and a brief climb down.  We brought beach chairs to sit and watch the people pick up little treasures.  The volunteers are very helpful and knowledgeable they provide plastic coated guides for the children to assist in looking for their little treasure. They make sure everyone is minding the rules - I was glad to see this. If you are going to walk around in the pool, be very careful as the rocks are covered with moss and are very slippery. My husband did take a tumble and bruised his ego. He was a little sore but managed to continue on with our vacation. Beautiful scenery and the weather was perfect for November at the ocean.",50,Cabrillo Tide Pools,November 2019

tessow,Beautiful ,Not a very large beach so I was able to walk the entirety of it. Walking in the direction of the cliffs the beach became quite rocky all the way to the end but in the opposite direction there’s a wonderful sandy portion. I found it great for beach combing as well at least the time I visited! Didn’t find much on the sandy portion but amongst all the rocks I did find some great shells sometimes a bit more hidden. Just have to look harder while also not tripping! ,50,Torrey Pines State Beach,April 2019

Matthew J,nice day for the whole family,"Belmont Park is a smaller version of Santa Cruz Boardwalk.  We found a Groupon that allowed the four of us to go on all the attractions for $69 and try out this beach side amusement park for the first time.  So we were able to try out everything except for the rides and ziplines.  We did laser tag, sky ropes, mini golf, rock wall, Xanadu, and arcades.  Parking is hard to find right by the beach.  However, parking is FREE!  We had a blast for the whole family and a bit of adrenaline rush on the sky ropes and laser tag.  Dole whip was delicious as well.  The restrooms in the park were clean, not like the extremely dirty one on the public beach nearby.",40,Belmont Park,November 2019
alysia79,Fun evening,It was fun to walk through Belmont Park and see the excitement. It was like a mini-carnival.

Most of the designer shops are represented along with the standard mall stores.  The food court has good variety and the movie theater is smartly integrated into the mall design.

The art is always stimulating as are the sweeping views of the Pacific from a gallery that sometimes is closed due to lender's restrictions.  In addition to showing solid contemporary pieces, the sculpture garden is relaxing and fun. The Sherwood Auditorium hosts an active lecture and film schedule.  The current exhibition on photographs from the Visual Arts department of UCSD during the 1960s and 1970s is both historically sound and intriguing look into this protest era.

H8shwswrk2,SeaWorld is not worth the money,"This was our 4th trip in 7 years and it will be the last. The park was nearly empty and that's a plus if you're just there for the rides. The positives were no lines and getting to see some of the animals (if you can get past the whole captivity conundrum). The negatives: not a lot of people means less shows, tons of closed shops/carts, multiple bored and disengaged staff. Then let's go into the food plan. As an adult I was able to select one entree, one side OR dessert, and one non-alcoholic drink. An upgrade to the ribs is available at an added price. Soft serve and funnel cakes aren't included. The biggest rip-off is you can only access this once every hour. Not that big of a deal except with only 2 of the restaurants open this was a pain going across the park to eat. Compound that with really crummy quality food. DO NOT PAY FOR THE FOOD OPTION! Maybe the weekend would be better but it really seems to be an over-priced disappointment. I want to support the work they do with rescues and conservation but I'll just make a donation next time. That way I wont expect anything in return for my money.",10,SeaWorld,October 2019
Tanya K,Impressive exhibits in a beautiful setting,"I love coming here.

tessthetraveller,Perfect small art museum,"The Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla does things right....starting with very reasonable admission prices and policies.  Everyone under 25 years old gets in free.  Adults pay $10 (ten bucks!) for a ticket that is good for a week's worth of return visits, including to their second site in San Diego.  The building, and its history, are worth a visit alone.  (Where would La Jolla be without the foresight and generosity of the Scripps sisters?)  The art work is always intriguing, with consistently high quality shows.  This art museum has the friendliest guards I've ever encountered. There is an enjoyable sculpture garden, facing directly onto the ocean.  The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch on a pleasant patio facing historic Saint James by the Sea church. And, yes....there is a small gift shop worthy of a long browse. This is a great place to take a family, no matter the ages. It is easily accessible from the hotels in the village of La Jolla.",50,Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego,December 2015

Jean P,Amazing library and architecture,"The Geisel Library, named in honor of Theodore Geisel (Dr. Suess)  is an amazing library. The architecture reminded me of a space ship or a Seuss drawing. The day I was there, there was a small collection of Suess sketches which were fun to see. The library appears to try to welcome students in a wide variety of ways - from an extensive collection of written literature to collaborative work areas, from jigsaw puzzle breaks to treadmill study desks, from model airplane displays to indoor plants. Outside, Dr. Suess and the Cat work on a new book.",50,Geisel Library,March 2015
800dash,Surprisingly fun and not awkward,First time at a nude beach and it was so much fun! It was not awkward at all. Mostly old people just trying to do their thing and not in a pervy way. We got to meet the locals and play volleyball with them. I'm not very good but they taught me a lot in one day. The stairs are awesome and seeing all the paragliding from the top is beautiful.,40,Black's Beach,August 2018
272gee,A little disappointing,"They let you in at 10, but nothing opens till 1030, rides at 11.  Rides shut down at 4.  Only 3 shows, but even at that, the shortened hours don't give you time to do everything.   Not worth the cost of a ticket!",30,SeaWorld,September 2019
BinnieB,A surprise,"We happened on this small but well-done museum simply wandering around La Jolla. The featured artist when we were there was Nicole W?????. Rather strange, but interesting. The one drawback was a docent who followed us around commenting on the art from his own personal political point of view that did not jibe with ours. I wish now that I had mentioned this to the person at the desk. The price is certainly right at $5 that I think is good for a week and also give you entry to another art museum in San Diego.",40,Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego,August 2015

The vendors are friendly and exactly who you'd expect to find in a surf town in SoCal!! The food stalls were outstanding. Make sure you get there hungry!!! There is a  Hispanic man who sells the most amazing fruit. He cuts watermelon , cucumber, jicama and mango in stalks.  Then he sprinkles everything with lime juice and special spices and serves it all up in a tall glass.....to die for!!!'",50,La Jolla Open Aire Market,February 2015

Cheshire84,Different yet Fun,"A couple things regarding this location: first, this cliff is not for people who easily get anxiety attacks. It is a fairly simple walk but there are a few iffy spots that makes people very nervous. Second, be aware of your stuff. My husband and I had two homeless men stalking our area/stuff and others. Best to leave valuables in the car that way if anything is stolen, it wasn't worth a lot. Third, the para-gliders are cool, but best to do it than watch. And third, if you are here take the extra 20 min drive to head to La Jolla Cove to see the Sea Lions.",40,Black's Beach,July 2018
Véronique C,"Two locations, one museum",Don't miss the downtown museum close to the Santa Fé . Together they presented top exhibitions. Very Friendly staff,50,Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego,June 2015
GlobalGypsy_13,Great site for modern art,"The downtown branch of the MCASD has one portion of the Santa Fe train station. Thus, their high ceilings are very conducive to showing big modern art pieces and sculpture. The current show ""Grace and Gravity by El-Anatsui"" has recycled art pieces dripping off of the walls and snake-like slithering or peak sculptures erupting from the floor. Because there is a drop off area directly in front of the museum, you can pop in to ask directions to the nearby parking structure on B St. where you can get $2.00 validated parking. It's also worth it to check out the adjacent train station to taste a bit of an almost by-gone era. So go before the end of June to see amazing textile-type and wood pieces (house posts) by an African artist at the MCASD/downtown (not the La Jolla location).",40,Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego,June 2015

Traveling_TK_11,Different perspective for Midwesterners! :),"This is a great way to observe surfers in their native habitat. :) While we've visited many beaches, and even tried our hand at the sport once or twice, this was the first time we had a chance to really experience surf culture - the rituals, the commaraderie, and the sheer number of participants. Even though the air temp was about 45 degrees on the morning we visited, there must have been 60 or more surfers in the water. We set up our picnic breakfast and just enjoyed watching everyone. Would love to go back in mid-summer for the complete California surf experience.",50,Tourmaline Surfing Park,April 2013
Memmett,a highlight of our trip,"I saw this market reviewed on Trip Advisor and so decided to add it to our trip from NY to La Jolla.  We were renting a house so we went to the market on the first Sunday to stock up on food for the week.  This was one of the highlights of our trip.  The market was huge, fresh, interesting, and fun.  The fruits and veggies were beautiful and plentiful and for us just a welcome site after a long winter.  The homemade pies were a must as were the homemade tacos and lemonade.  We also bought some grass fed beef ribs for a dinner the next night, veggies, strawberries, blood oranges, bread, guacamole, goats cheese...  Such a nice way to visit a place and get a true local flavor - better than any tourist location we know!",50,La Jolla Open Aire Market,April 2014

Fiddling4ag,Very fun!,It is fun to walk down the steps in a narrow passageway.  The end of the passage opens onto a platform that has a beautiful view of La Jolla Cove.  I recommend this to anyone who has the stamina to walk down 144 steps.  Remember that you have to walk back up them!  The price is very fair and the store has unique treasures.,50,Sunny Jim Cave,May 2017
Craig1961_01,Some history worth seeing,"Been here many years ago but forgotten the size and scope of it. The barn museum as you enter from the ‘bus tour’ stop side is worth the visit alone. Fascinating history of how staging and transport developed in the south west and to see how constraints and obstacles to trade and post services were solved. There are some other retro shops with the usual collection of tourist stuff, some are quite expensive. The very colourful Mexican outdoor cantina and dancing stage are bright and attract people like magnets, the menu looks good value although we didn’t stop here. The theme continues a little on the Main Street where bars & restaurants increase in number. Can easily spend 2-3 hours looking around having drinks or lunch/ dinner at this place.",40,Old Town San Diego,June 2019
TravelGoddess61,"A very historical area with old buildings, restaurants, and shops.","We really enjoyed walking through all the historical buildings with lots of information about the past history of each one. There are also fun shops, and restaurants too. It is a large area to visit so plan at least 3 hours or more to allow time to see everything and eat there also. It is close to a train station so you can possibly take the train there depending on where you are staying in San Diego. It is a must see attraction for anyone, and lots of Spanish influence and great food too. ",40,Old Town San Diego,November 2018

We ended up parking by the high school and walking a few blocks to get to the market. We loved the produce vendors. One produce vendor were offering pluots, a cross between a plum and an apricot. Those were so good. After tasting a sample, we purchased a few pounds. They were so good. We also found the green smoothie stand, the greek food all equally good. In fact, we stayed there an hour longer than I had planned.  A fun activity to do in La Jolla. Just go early to get a good parking space.",50,La Jolla Open Aire Market,July 2013
Christiana A,I lived in California most of my life and I don't know how I never knew about this cave!!,Its a hidden gem. It wasn't really somewhere we spent a lot of time and the cost was a bit discouraging.... but it was so worth it the walk down the steep water logged steps was a bit scary (while carrying a toddler) but the cave was awesome!! We took some great photographs down there. The mans profile in the cave opening is fantastic it was very cool to see.,50,Sunny Jim Cave,June 2016

Mary B,What a Treasure,"There is ample parking across the street from the village. A walk across from the parking lot is by stairs or ramp to a short tunnel. The village is open on Sunday (but surrounding stores are closed). OTSD is just laid out beautifully with antiquated buildings that are now museums, shops and restaurants surrounding green space. The shops are wonderful and everyone of the people managing them are friendly and helpful. The food is awesome...must try the Nibble chocolate store with their Organic Brazilian Dark Chocolate (my favorite) as well as other types (70% and 80% Cocoa.). The Iced Chocolate is very good as well. There were all ages walking around and it's definitely a must to visit.",50,Old Town San Diego,May 2019

A good number of shows go to Broadway and I am glad that they still include a few non-conventional shows.   I usually go to the preview weeks and typically end up watching the last week too just to watch how the play/musical evolved.   I am so glad we have the Playhouse in San Diego.

Tonya C,Like Stepping Into the Past,Old Town is definitely a great place to walk around.  It’s like stepping into the Old West.  There’s so much to do in Old Town and so much history to see.  I enjoyed the Courthouse Museum and the McCoy House (both were small but free).  Within walking distance was the Whaley House which costs $10 but it’s worth it to explore one of the most haunted houses in America.

The tobacco museum was also like a period drama.  There are also lots of lovely little shops to browse in.

You have to then walk down (and of course back up again)145 wooden steps to enter the ""cave."" The cave itself is very unimpressive as it is not so much a cave as a hole through rock looking out to sea. We were expecting an actual cave experience. One quick photo then back up again. You can see much the same thing for free at La Jolla Cove without walking up and down the 145 steps. Save yourself $5 and don't bother with it.",10,Sunny Jim Cave,February 2016
rustynail78,Not for everyone,"This is a great beach, but not for everyone.   We could barely see the beach from the cliff top because of the fog.  Decided to hike down anyway.  It's not super easy to hike the Cliffside and the stairs even though surfers make it look easy carrying their boards!!   Well rewarded once on the sand at low tide with endless beach.  We didn't know going in to it that it was a nude beach.  All good with that and had a lovely walk.  Could have gone forever.   Once back at the rope we encountered two families with children who we discouraged from hiking down.  They expressed concerns for the children's sake and religious reasons.",50,Black's Beach,March 2017
Perseverance,Spectacular!,"As nudists, we immediately fell in love with this beach! Can take a nice long beach stroll with no issues, not a lot of clothing optional beaches have this sort of long shoreline to walk. The climb down and back up can be a challenge. Take your time and yes, do wear running shoes or similar. Flip flops don't cut it. The far north end may have some ??? activity off the beach, just avoid. Love the mix of nudists and non in one friendly accepting location.",50,Black's Beach,March 2017
pearmech,"Interesting, but...","...not a must see. Many restaurants and stores selling their wears. Some authentic items, but nothing of any real note.

heidiz996,Fun place to wander,"We wandered the streets of Old Town after touring the Mormon Battalion Site.  What a fun place!  Yes, it is full of tourist shops that all sell the same things, but it was fun none the less and exactly what you would expect to see.  We didn't eat there, but the food smelled delicious. We did get some freshly made flour tortillas that were being sold a 3 for $1. They were so good!  ",40,Old Town San Diego,January 2019
E3554DBjosephc,What a Beautiful & Amazing Place ,"I visited the beach in early February. The water was cold, but the views from the beach were amazing. The beach is split into two selections, one for clothed and the other for clothing optional sun seekers. The people I met were very friendly and overall it was a great day. The path to the beach can be a bit challenging in places, good shoes are recommended. Make sure you bring along some water, no facilities are available and everything you bring down must be carried back up to the top of the trail. If you are in the area it is a must see place.

KLAvisitor,Only beach like it in San Diego,"Also, walking south from the trail is one of the best surf spots in SD. Surfing can be pumping down there with some of the best surfers in the city out. Not the most beginner friendly, but if you want SD at its best head out and charge it.",50,Black's Beach,September 2016
JewDontKnow,It's only $5,"We enjoyed ourselves. It's only $5 per person so who cares. I think the experience is going through the cave itself, as the view is extremely disappointing haha...either way it was fun (and I even slipped!! Haha)",40,Sunny Jim Cave,February 2016
email4saundra1,One hundred forty five steps to the bottom,"You enter through the cave shop. It's not a big cave, but you end up right at the ocean, so worth the $5. Parking can be difficult if the sun is shining. Recommend!",40,Sunny Jim Cave,January 2016

mrdayoh,Great beach but,Plenty of parking at the SD Glider port. ,50,Black's Beach,July 2017
edwardNsandra,A little disappointed,"After reading the reviews, I was a little excited to check this out. It costs $5 per adult and $3 per child, which I thought was a bit much, but nonetheless, still wanted to see it. The stairs are very narrow and a bit steep, but not scary. I would imagine someone with very large feet or someone very tall would not enjoy this at all. After walking down the many steps, we all felt a little disappointed with the view. It was pretty enough, but really nothing too exciting and with the crowd of people hanging out, there really was no room to take pictures. I managed to snap just one photo and we went right back up the steps. All in all, the entire experience took no more than 10 minutes and quite frankly we had a much better view outside the store than down the cave.",30,Sunny Jim Cave,March 2016
John B,Quirky and fun,"I loved the history of how and why this ""tunnel/shaft"" was built.  For $5 it is worth the short hike just to say you did it.  Met a guy retreating quickly up the steps, breathing heavily and sweating, muttering something about claustrophobia. Take that as an important safety tip...",40,Sunny Jim Cave,April 2016
FL_BabyMomma,"Fine for 15 minutes, not really worth the money","Staff isn't super friendly, and it is a little silly to pay $5 a person to see this one cave, but the kids feel like they are having an adventure, and if you don't live in a place that has this type of scenery it is worth going. Plan to walk around the coast nearby, check out the sea lions and seals, and pair it with a meal at a nearby restaurant to make it a real outing. ",30,Sunny Jim Cave,April 2016

BZimm08,One of our Favorite Attractions in San Diego!,"I didn't expect how big of an area Old Town was. I figured it would have just been a small street lined with older buildings, but it was lively! Old Town had an open air museum full of cool shops, museums, and tours, everything was nicely organized and decorated. After exploring this portion, head over to where all the restaurants and shops are. There was a market here both days I went, with a few interesting items. A lot of the restaurants looked fantastic, with great outdoor seating areas. The church here is beautiful as well. You can spend almost a full day down here, I highly recommend visiting Old Town.",50,Old Town San Diego,March 2019

King_Greene,Loved it ,"This is my first nude beach, which I really did enjoy. The FIRST thing u must know is there is a VERY long, semi dangerous, walk down a very steep hill with steps. You will get a leg workout, and tired. Some of the steps were unstable. I am a 30 year old, 250 pound power lifter and I felt nervous and tired. The beach itself was nice, clean. They have about 4-5 volleyball nets and balls you can play at. A lot of parking but you might have to park up and down the street if the lot is full. I HIGHLY do not recommend you bring you child.",50,Black's Beach,October 2017
lxjuarez,Very interesting and you don't have to get wet,Easy to visit via the Cave store. They accept credit cards. Long set of stairs take you down to the cave. It is a long way down but worth to visit at least once. Great place to take pictures. ,50,Sunny Jim Cave,June 2016
Mike B,Worth seeing,"First the downside. This is located in La Jolla, and priced accordingly.  $5 for adults, $3 for children is a little steep. The attraction is 145 steps to a smallish platform. All that said, the view out of the mouth of the cave is amazing, and the waves breaking around the entrance are cool also. Worth doing, but figure it's a 15-20 minute excursion. The cave store is worth a good browsing as well. If you can spend $20 on jewelry, cave entry is free. I gave it 3 stars based on cost vs. quality of experience. ",30,Sunny Jim Cave,June 2016
Rachel W,Excellent views!,"Really beautiful, and don't be scared off by the number of steps... they're a gradual incline and not hard at all (trust me, I'm completely out of shape and did fine).",40,Sunny Jim Cave,July 2016
Robert W,It was nice to see the cave but only a 15 minute experience.,It is $5 to go down into the cave.  Its a quick walk down and then its just a cave at the sea.  So to pay $25 for the family to go down seemed like a little much.  I'm glad we did it but I think it should be closer to $2-3 a person.,30,Sunny Jim Cave,July 2016

279ericai,A must-do in San Diego,"Old Town San Diego is a must do if you are visiting this city. It is full of history, with the McCoy house that shows how big (or...little?) San Diego used to be when it was first created way back when. There are plenty of delicious places to get a drink or eat food (I would recommend Barra Barra). There are lots of wonderful shops (they have a great cigar shop and an awesome candle store where you can make your own candles!). The best part is that they have their own little Mexican market, so it's like a little slice of Mexico right in California. We really enjoyed our time here and wished that we could have stayed longer. Do yourself a favor and go!",50,Old Town San Diego,April 2019
Upekkhapr,We had a lovely time for about 3 hours!!,"We stoped on almost ten shops to bye presents and eat candy, root beer floats and tea or coffee! They have a park in the middle for picnics and resting on the grass! We loved it! They have public bathrooms in the beginning at a shop that has three levels (3rd floor) and at the other end near the restaurant and Information Center. I didn’t see any fountains of water but many places to buy drinks with or without alcohol. There are some places to buy gifts from Mexico without having to drive there! Check out my many pictures here and on the picture area! They have a hotel inside too! Many stores and things to do! There’s lots of public free parking outside and close to both entrances! ",50,Old Town San Diego,May 2019
Poly_grr,Beautiful views from the cliffs!,"We did not go to the beach because the access is through stairs (a lot), and our toddler was asleep. So we enjoyed the views from the top of the cliffs, they are breathtaking! We read that clothes are optional on this beach, but it seems to be also a great surf spot, since we saw a lot of surfers going downstairs. There is a small lookout upstairs, but there is no place to seat. Parking lot is huge and for free. ",50,Black's Beach,October 2017
Joyce T,Amazing Beach but Very Challenging Access,"We prepared for our beach adventure with cooler, chairs etc... and were grateful that a young surfer told us 'you don't want to be carrying anything down there' as it is a fairly difficult trail.  Well, he was not kidding.  The views are spectacular but I would not suggest the trail if you are at all unstable on your feet.  The trail is very steep (basically sand) with lots of very steep 'stairs' braced with wood ties and very few hand rails.   I understand there is another access that is steep, but a paved road that the life guards drive down so probably provided more stable footing.  However, this is a beautiful beach--sand has beautiful fools gold and is not busy.  Yes, there is some nudity but it wasn't in your face.",40,Black's Beach,December 2017

BJ_and_Leslie,Feel like the Goonies,"Descending the steps to Sunny Jim's cave certainly felt like entering the world the Goonies explored, and looking out from the cave to the Pacific made it feel even moreso. It really is just 145 ancient stairs down to a platform in a cave that's accessed in a gift shop, but it was a fun 20 minutes or so. It was short jaunt, and not a whole lot to see, so for $10 for two of us, it might not have been the best value. But it was cool, and we're glad we did it nonetheless.

niqnak2289,Wonky natural beauty,"I believe you can also enter the cave when you rent kayaks in the area,BUT, don't be thinking this is a large cave you can explore better by water. Its very small...2 kayaks fit but you won't get in far. Its more like just a different view point. Also we saw novice kayakers have issues getting out of the cave.

M G,Save your money and time,"I am an avid goer of museums and other educational attractions......I purchased a year long pass and most of the exhibits were mediocre to say the least......there were 1 or 2 that I thought were very artistic throughout the year, however, majority of the exhibits I felt were very child like in nature that anyone could do and were not real art......I hate it when people try to feed you the ""this is amazing art and creativity"" when it is not.......for example.....one exhibit was a wall full of pinned up notes, these notes were written by museum visitors and pinned to the wall because the ""artist"" wrote a message on the wall asking visitors to pin a note......this is not art, this is an every day occurrence in the workplace or at home.........example number two.....there was an  exhibit of a pole in the middle of an empty room........a third example.....an empty room with a lamp which had a red light bulb in it.............like I said, I am a fan of creativity and art but to me, these exhibits were not very artistic nor where they very creative........definitely save your money and visit one of the other museums in Balboa park or the USS Midway, they are far better and more educational.",20,Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego,January 2014

I walked along the beach for a couple miles, and must have lost track of time, because I ended up several miles later at Torrey Pines State Reserve.

The dolphin and sea lion shows are very fun and entertaining, as well as, educational, stimulating, and captivating. The rides are good. I would recommend investing in a fast pass. The food and drinks are very expensive. If you are going to be there a long time on a hot day then invest in the refillable cup. Although expensive the animal interaction opportunities are very fun and very memorable. They run from $60 to about $200.

If you have the time you can wander in and out of the stores and shops and find a nice restaurant to eat at.  Music & dancing is a common occurrence and can contribute to a fun, festive atmosphere.  Outside of the park which is still considered Old Town, is more touristy with lots of people wandering around checking out souvenirs, learning more of the history of San Diego and especially enjoying one of the numerous restaurants.

The water was also clean but cold for July. The walk is tough but not nearly as bad as other reviews had me ready for.  The stairs are uneven and there is a little section here and there that there are no stairs but if you can climb the stairs at home you will be fine.

The only catch, as you may have already read in some of the other reviews, is the access: not so bad going down, but definitely quite a challenge going back up. Definitely travel light, and be prepared for a good workout. Also keep in mind, the only thing down there is pure beach; no amenities, such as restrooms, so make sure you evacuate your bladder and bowls before taking the hike down, and bring plenty of water and sunscreen.

volcanogirl,A Fun Little Adventure,"We had fun exploring this little cave. You enter through the Cave Store, pay your five bucks, and then enter the cave itself through a heavy wooden door. There are 145 steps down but it's a pretty easy walk; the path is illuminated, and there are handrails. I'd recommend wearing sneakers rather than flip flops if you can. The steps can be a bit wet. At the bottom of the stairs, there's a small wooden platform where you can stand and look out through the cave opening to see the waves and sea lions that congregate in the area. The entrance to the cave resembles a profile of a cartoon character, so that's how it got its name. The entire trips only takes about ten minutes and gives you a nice view and neat perspective. The area surrounding the store is beautiful. Don't miss reading about the history of the cave - a German artist who had everything stolen from him hired two Chinese immigrants to dig out the cave to help fund his retirement, and it's been open to the public for over a hundred years. Worth seeing if you're in the area.",40,Sunny Jim Cave,April 2017

Harry2J,Amazing time,"Booking online sure paid off,entrance was cheaper and hassle free. Once you enter the  parking lot, you are given an easy to navigate map and the times of the various shows. We had a blast. It was trully amazing to see the various animals and the amount of skill and care to prepare and present these shows. It is also great that they allow the animals some freedom and they are not drilled into exhaustion. The sea lion show,the killer whale show and the dolphin show were definitely the highlights. Those who thought they were brave enough to seat in the front rows soon realized,you really get soaked . That was fun to see. Sea World do extensive  conservation work and animal rescue rescue. So the proceeds from your visit goes a very long way. At the park is also alot more to see and do. But lunch at the Shipwreck was awesome. There is a bit of a wait but was totally worth it. That chicken was amazing. We enjoyed the various rides and especially our helicopter tour of the Artic circle .

I can assume they are there because its less crowded and others are there for the ""view"". I think people need to understand that being a nudist is about being nude. Not about who you see nude. To many reviews complain about ""old naked fat guys"". If they are worried about who they see then they are there for the wrong reasons. Men are always going to out number women.

Yes, they have added some coasters/rides but some were closed in peak season July.  I paid $55 online and I'm glad I didn't pay more.

KayDawn97,Cave?,We did not do a kayak tour which looks super fun so if you're into that sort of thing I would look into it. We did walk around which was nice but the $5 per person to walk down in the cave was not worth it. It was a super small area once you got down there and it wasn't very big. I don't think it was worth the $5 and 145 steps. Maybe sometimes there are sea lions down there in which case it would be worth it but other than that it was eh. Kids might enjoy it a little more though especially if they've never been in a cave. ,30,Sunny Jim Cave,July 2017
Terry R,An added bonus.,We paid the $5 and did the steps. We got to the bottom and about 20 feet from the dock/platform was a sea lion relaxing on a large rock in the cave.

Soleil122,Confusing,"You have to ask, why?  And why at this location since the event it represents occurred in New York City and had nothing to do with the USS Midway, which is behind this large statue.  For a retired military person I did not like the fact that a small group of naval personnel--and don't know if they were active, reserve, students or something else--were conducting an enlistment ceremony right at the base of the statue; totally inappropriate for such a serious moment in a young man's life.  There was no US flag present, which is required for such ceremonies, just the statue of a couple kissing and hundreds of tourists, mostly foreign, milling around with boom boxes blaring some incomprehensible noise.  The statue is part of an extended park area and walkway along the pier and sits next to the Midway.

Once you get to the bottom of the short tunnel there is a VERY small place you can stand and take a picture or look out to the ocean. Kind of interesting..

lonewolf44,Great architecture and great library too,"The USC Sixth Campus at La Jolla is home to this extraordinary library building, named for Dr Seuss himself who spent the last years of his life in San Diego and La Jolla, You can approach it from the Engineering faculty buildings by climbing up a path painted to resemble a rattlesnake which helps you appreciate the striking design. The entrance is below and with the stained glass sliding doors it is, to all intents and purposes. like entering a cathedral of study. It is silent. The Dr Seuss Room on the ground floor is actually a lecture theatre but there are some of his drawings on display. While you're there check out Do Ho Suh's 'Fallen Star', the light blue house apparently hanging over the top of nearby Engineering 1. If you go up to the 7th floor you see an apparently normal little house (the original is in Providence, RI) and garden through the glass. It's supposedly open to the public from 11-2 Tues-Thurs but on this Wednesday it manifestly wasn't. I was still glad I took the elevator up to have a closer look at it though. And USCD can be reached by express bus 150 or slower bus 30 from the Old Town Transit Centre or the Downtown in San Diego - it's $7 for a day pass.",40,Geisel Library,July 2015

MGreene16,Terrible service at crepes stand ruined our experience,"This was generally a pleasant farmer's market; considerably smaller than Hillcrest or Little Italy.  There was plenty of variety in the food stands and some nice artists vendors.  Our experience was marred by the terrible service at the crepes stand run by two ladies.  Service was running slow; I waited in a short line for a long time and finally ordered a dessert crepe.  Mine stayed as the last order up for a while since they stopped taking new orders to catch up.  Normally they were making two at a time, but just before my order would have been started, the second preparer decided to stop and help the order taker instead.  When the first preparer started my crepe, I realized she was putting on buckwheat batter.  When I reminded her I had a sweet crepe, she said, ""Oh, we're out of the sweet batter.""  That was not mentioned when I ordered or I wouldn't have gotten it.  No apologies; just some testy comments about how the market was almost ready to close and that they got good ratings from the Department of Health?? I asked for my money back and left; 20 minutes wasted.

It was very emotional for me being a Viet Nam vet and having experienced the marvelous work he did.  He was truly one of the great "" givers"" of American history.  It was touching seeing the greater than life statue of the Kiss realizing the nurse in that famous photo had passed away just a short time ago.  I know they determined who she was, but did they ever discover the identity of the sailor?   I know they didn't know each other at the time of the photo.

If it’s your first time at a nude beach, it might take some getting used to but honestly, no one is really staring at you - most everyone is there to do their own thing and are pretty respectful to not stare at you.

IndyRunner1984,Great beach but bring your gym shoes,"I really like this beach and it was the highlight of my vacation. There are no bathrooms so just an FYI, go before you go. There isn't much signage either as where to park or how to access the trail to get down the cliff. We were mistakenly told to go through the glider port field and had several jerks both on the ground and in the air screaming at us while we were trying to exit the field. They really need to put up better signage and perhaps make an actual parking lot here. The parking lot is only sand, incredibly bumpy, so bad if you're not careful you could easily break an axle in a small car. Luckily we were in a rented suv. The hike down is brutal so I honestly recommend wearing gym shoes and bringing your flip flops with you. There aren't any places on the beach to get beverages or food either so bring your own. This is a nudist beach and is not patrolled. Most of the time, people leave you alone, but if you're a woman, I suggest going in a group because some men think a nudist beach is a place to pickup women rather than basque in the joy of experiencing nature and the ocean on the most intimate level. I really wish the trail had better hand rails or something to hold on to. It would be very hard for someone with mobility issues, the aged, children, or out of shape folks to hike up and down this trail. I run marathons and even I had a hard time because I was afraid I was going to fall. Still, a very nice beach and gorgeous views from here.",50,Black's Beach,May 2019

Patricia K,"Morning, noon and night time treat",Walked the park daily with it's beautiful surroundings daily during our La Jolla stay.

No weddings taken place during our visit but it must be spectacular when one celebrates such an event at this site.,50,Cuvier Park - The Wedding Bowl,May 2016
blu0710,Nothing Special,"Just attended my aunts wedding here, and there was nothing special about this location. Being out of town, we highly leaned on pictures for choosing this location. When we arrived to town, we were disappointed. The grass is not green, there is so much dirt where the ceremony was held, and when asked if the ceremony could be shifted to face a different direction the bride was told ""don't worry my staff knows what they are doing. You just show up."" As a professional in the industry, this is not how you treat any client, let alone a bride! A lot of money is paid for this location, and the only thing worth it was the love from family and friends. ",30,Cuvier Park - The Wedding Bowl,June 2016

Linda C,Escape to Margaritaville is headed to Broadway,"How fortunate we are to have LJ Playhouse in our area! 28 shows from LJP have gone on to Broadway and now, Jimmy Buffet-inspired ""Escape to Margaritaville"" is joining them.  Saw the production July 7- outstanding.  Story line, music, choreography, sets, lighting- all first class as we have come to expect from the uber talented production staff and crew.  Only ""needs improvement"" comments: actress playing Marley should drop the ""island accent"" as she was hard to understand; ""Rachel's"" voice was shrill as times, Tully's last number seemed in the wrong key for him to sing comfortably.  The male cast stars were just terrific.  Thank you all for the wonderful evening of musical theatre and the very best of wishes to everyone for a another Tony- worthy and fantastic Broadway run!",50,La Jolla Playhouse,July 2017

eastcoastbb,Nice placement among the other naval history sights,"We have seen this work by Seward Johnson before, when it was in Sarasota, FL. It is an impressive sight.

christym72,Great time!,"The only reason its 4 stars instead of 5 is their hours.  We got there at 1030.  Nothing is even open until after 11.  That doesn't give you much time for rides, shows, exhibits, etc.  We upgraded to the all you can eat package for 20 extra a person.  The food and drink is expensive, so I found it worth it.  The food is only mediocre however.  The shows were so good, loved the orca show and the sea lion show was a hoot! The dolphin show was cancelled due to one of them giving birth.  I did feel some of the workers there were a bit rude.  The guy for the motion theater ride (not worth it) was very rude and yelling at the guests.  One of the dolphin trainers was quite mean to the guests as well, very snotty actually.  I feel they could be friendlier and answer questions without snapping your head off. Due to time, we missed the turtle exhibit and the otters.  But all the other exhibits were great.  The beluga whale was so cool and the girl talking about him was friendly and explained a lot.  We were amazed at the walrus and how HUGE they are!  The penguin exhibit was cool as well.  I felt it was well worth the visit, just wish they had another hour or two to see things and the dolphin trainer could be nicer to the customers. ",40,SeaWorld,October 2019
frankt413,Great attraction,I hadn't been to this SeaWorld in about 20 years. It is still a great place to spend the day. The show's are all very good. They are very informative and funny. The killer whale show was better then I thought it would be. This time of year is a great time to visit. It was not very crowded at all.,50,SeaWorld,October 2019
cyrilpmontana,SeaWorld after so many years ,I don’t remember how it was before. Almost 20 years the last time I visited this place. I remember their great show with shamu before but this time I think it’s less connection with the audience. Better before I should say.... ,30,SeaWorld,October 2019

deegooch,Great Day Trip!,"My daughter and I took the trolley to Old Town while my husband was at the Convention Center for an event.  Lots of shopping, boutiques, souvenirs, etc.  There are some unique little shops to explore.  We enjoyed stopping in the model railroad museum, photographing the old cemetery, lunch at Cafe Coyote (good stuff!) and dinner at the Rockin' Baha Lobster grill (excellent!).  We toured the Whaley House (did not see any ghosts).  The old town square was great.. I love to explore old historical sights.",50,Old Town San Diego,October 2019

Daniel M,Great beach,"My recent visit to the beach was just as I remembered.   Steep trail to access but once there, the vibe is very chill.  It is clothing optional and frankly nobody really cares.

It was further north then blacks but please don’t place your blankets and whatever next to the cliffs. Chunks of the cliff can and do fall once in awhile so just be cautious!,50,Black's Beach,August 2019
Tim H,Worth the hike!,"Yes, hiking down the 340 linear feet from the bluff to the beach is not for everyone (and hiking out can be taxing), the experience on the beach was total chill. Nude bathers in couples and singles spread out comfortably with respect and total comfort. I was told that the beach hosts a lot of gay men - but not my experience. More than 70% of the people on the beach were male-female couples or groups. Very relaxed for me to be there as a single, hetero male. ",50,Black's Beach,July 2019
Iowafamilyofsix,Neat!,"Didn't know what to expect, but for $5.00 a person, we had to try it.  Glad we did! Fascinating history to the cave and a fun climb down and back. Worth a try if steps don't wear you out.",40,Sunny Jim Cave,December 2018
Bethany W,Total rip-off don't waste your money,"Yeah, we paid $13 to climb down and back up the stairs and NOT SEE ANY SEA LIONS.  Such utter BS.  They have cameras down there.  The least they could do is be honest and tell you it's not a good time, but nope they will happily take your money and let you climb down there for nothing.  You can see the sea lions and seals up close for free further around the road.  Don't waste your money, time or steps.",10,Sunny Jim Cave,December 2018

Brigzermann,Stairs.. lots!,We walked by the shop and gave it a go. There’s  over 100 stairs down and then back up. They aren’t terrible but that’s your only way in and out. Pretty view at the bottom. Save your $5 each and do something else though.,30,Sunny Jim Cave,February 2019
Yuliya T,A must see,"This is a very beautiful view. It cost five dollars to go down, they are about 145 stairs but it is worth going down and seeing the view from the cave. There are a lot of stairs but they are pretty wide and sturdy, not very difficult To get up and down. The only negative is  we got there first thing in the morning which is 10 AM when the shop is supposed to open. We waited for about 15 minutes for the shop to open and the employee who was there coming in was very unhappy to be there. As she was coming in late and saw the line of waiting people, she said “If you come back in 10 minutes you won’t have to stand and wait. At that point the shop should’ve been opened at least 15 minutes ago. She was unhappy even after the shop was open and she was taking our money for us to go down to the cave. Besides the unpleasant encounter with her, I thoroughly enjoyed this place and would recommend to others.",40,Sunny Jim Cave,February 2019

DWUK,So so outdoor mall,"All in okay mall, nothing special.",30,Westfield UTC,January 2019
georgecmeredith,Very Good Outdoor Mall in La Jolla,This is a large diversified mall with both anchor and boutique stores.  It is currently under renovation so some pathways are blocked off and this combined with a sprawling layout makes some of the stores hard to find.  We doubled back a couple of times but in the end it was worth it.  If you're in the San Diego area this is a good mall. As an added bonus there is a full size ice rink on site and you can sit in free seating at the food court and watch hockey practice.,40,Westfield UTC,December 2018
885beckyg,Nice Mall but hard to navigate,"In La Jolla for work and stuck for something to do on a Sunday afternoon so took a walk to this outdoor mall.

SHERLOCKSanDiego_ca,Great Summer Time Walk!!,"When the weather is good this is a great outdoor mall to stroll in. Having been recently updated and much, much improved, with high end stores and normal establishments, plus a host of great restaurants, some of the best in town. Note they do now charge for parking, two hours are free, the remainder of your time is $2.50 per hour to a max of $15 per day. This I found somewhat annoying in that if you shop and eat 2 hours is nothing, and I am not sure stores validate your tickets except the movie house and 24Hour Fitness.",40,Westfield UTC,March 2019

It takes place on the grounds of the La Jolla Elementary School every Sunday from 9 to 1 PM.  About 35-40 stalls were set up the weekend we visited, selling everything from produce to flowers and succulents to food to clothing and craft items.

Larry B,Best Breakfast Ever,"amazing freshly squeezed watermelon lemonade from SoCalLemonade and the vendor's omelet (which they prepare every week for the other vendors at the La Jolla Open Aire Market) from Crepes Up, which was truly a work of art - all the fresh veggies, cheese, freshly sliced avocado and green chilli sauce (and even though this may sounds unusual - a touch of pesto).

slwsweet,Good Venue,"We have been to the playhouse several times.  We went last week to see Donna Summers The Musical, which was extended two weeks because it was so popular.  It was excellent, and on its way to Broadway.  The playhouse is a lovely theater--not too big, and has a lovely stage with the nicest ushers in the universe.  The donors behind the Playhouse try to get the best plays/musicals it can at this venue, and many have gone on to Broadway.  There are not a lot of food options nearby, but on this evening there was a food truck for those who didn't want to spend a lot of money.  The only annoying thing I find about the playhouse is that its air conditioning is noisy to the point when it can distract from the play/musical.",40,La Jolla Playhouse,December 2017

springlering,Tacky Fun,"Fun and tacky, with a bit of interesting history thrown in.  The Wells Fargo museum was particularly interesting.  Lots of colorful shopping, including a lot of  ridiculous Chinese junk, and some very nice Mexican crafts.   The cigar shop stinks up one while end of town, unfortunately.  Have to wonder how many sales the candy shop next door has lost from subliminally queasy visitors.   The Nibbles vegan chocolate shop is outstanding.  The got chocolate was terrific, and my vegan daughter raves over the cookies, while her non-vegan  dad gobbled down a rich moist chocolate brownie.  ",50,Old Town San Diego,November 2019

It's a fully nude beach so to much of our surprise, there we were in the middle of it. It's very cool to see people be so free. It was people of all ages and all genders. I had my teenager with me so she was a bit uncomfortable, also a greta time to have a ""teen"" talk, but I was just happy to see there are still places in the world where people can be 100% comfortable in their own skin.

JayElliott94,Scenic and secluded,"The only negative, which isn’t all that bad in my book, is the hike back up the cliff which will definitely get your heart rate up. The trek down the cliff, although steep, isn’t nearly as strenuous. The beach itself is wide open and a site to see. It’s a nude beach which many other reviews have noted but there’s nothing better than the freedom you experience once you’re there. ",50,Black's Beach,June 2019

It is 145ish steps down into the cave, with a small deck to view out. That’s it. But the view is nice and worth the time.

David F,Great Place for a non-surfer to relax and watch,"We arrived at Tourmaline Surfing Park about 12:30 PM, on a Tuesday in August, and the parking lot had 5-6 open spots, which we greatly appreciated. (I did notice that the lot turnover was reasonable. I would say of the closest 6 spots to our car 3 of them turned over while we were there for 2 hours.) Google maps took us right to the beach no problem. The rest room facilities were what we have all come to expect of public rec places. No fear here though, the toilets, sinks, and the outdoor showers work. The entry to the beach is either by ramp or stairs. Both are in good shape! The beach is a 2 level site. The high sand and then a drop of about 8 to 10 feet down to the tide plane. The upper level is a great place to stake out your HQ and then from there down to the beach/water to do your thing. This is definitely a surf focused location and non-surfers stand and get their feet wet and walk or run up and down the beach. Overall, this was a great find. Great opportunities to people watch. Laid back vibe. I don't think I have found a better beach to meet my tastes! Five Stars!!!!",50,Tourmaline Surfing Park,August 2019

The lighthouse is interesting and well preserved on it's own.  However the views from this area area amazing.  You can see out to islands in the oceans, Mexico to the south, and the whole coastline to the north.  However the closer view to the south is truly specatacular.  The entire city of San Diego is here.  Right below across the channel is a very active Naval Air Station North Island.  The entrance channel to San Diego is completely visible.  There are many sailboats, tour boats, and an occasional freighter.  Here also is where the major Navy ships enter and exit including destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and submarines.  I recommend visiting on Fridays when the Navy frequently brings ships from local traing in the ocean back to base for the weekend. ",50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,January 2019

GlobalGypsy_13,Iconic,"Although this lighthouse only operated for 30 years due to the weather, the stturdy, compact structure is worth a visit. In addition to the interior furnished rooms of the lightkeeper and his family, you can learn about the mechanics of lights in the almost adjacent assistant light keeper's cottage. ",50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,November 2018
Dean A,One of our fantastic light houses around our coast.,"Obviously San Diego has a harbor so navigation is very important in the times of the past and of course now.  If I recall, you are pretty much just across downtown San Diego. ",40,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,September 2018
Mike_TV_Producer,Worth the short drive,Incredible view of San Diego and Pacific. Travel through national cemetary. Don’t miss the tide pools right after high tide.,50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,September 2018
scovillb,LOVED IT,We went to the Children's Pool in La Jolla to see the sea lions and it was amazing! We couldn't go onto the beach because of the time of year but that did not matter we loved getting a close up view of the animals. Highly recommend it!,50,Children's Pool,April 2019
lubumbashi13,So fun!,"So fun to watch the harbor seals lay around, attempt to shimmy up on rocks and frolic in the waves. It can be crowded (both with people and with seals) - we were lucky enough to go in April when there were lots of baby seal to spot!",50,Children's Pool,April 2019

RebeccaR982,Nice way to spend a day,Beautiful park with lots to. My husband and I were visiting family and they took us to Balboa Park for the day. I especially enjoyed the Japanese Gardens. A nice place to walk and relax for the day. We found free parking near the entrance.,40,Balboa Park,November 2019
20854Dave_K,A neat piece of history!,"We almost didn't have time to see this lighthouse in Cabrillo National Monument Park, but I'm glad we were able to squeeze the visit in during the afternoon before heading off for dinner and a late night flight to return home from our San Diego vacation.  One building had some detailed information on the history of lighthouses on the West Coast, as well as how lighthouse technology improved through the years.  Another building showed the living quarters of the folks who manned the lighthouse and kept things operating.  All neat stuff to remind us of our past.  San Diego was in a heat wave when we visited, so the trek from the parking lot to the lighthouse was a little tougher than normal, but on a normal pleasant San Diego day, the walk is just a short one.  If driving, be ready for the $15 entrance fee to the Park, which includes the Cabrillo National Monument itself, as well as trails, tide pools, and other small historical tidbits to take in.  If you have a little more time, this is a great place to get some good walking exercise outdoors while enjoying great views of the San Diego area and learning a little bit of its history.",50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,August 2018

You can also get to know the history in the attached house. I loved it. ",50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,September 2018
picklefly,"Smelly, but beautiful wildlife","The Children's Pool was originally imagined to provide a safe place for children to swim in the Pacific Ocean.  Seals and Sea lions have taken advantage of the sea wall as a safe haven for their own pups.  Welping season is mid-winter to mid-spring, so it's a great time to visit if you want to see seal pups interacting with adults.  You are forbidden from actually approaching and interacting with the wildlife, but they are truly beautiful to behold from afar",40,Children's Pool,March 2019

kmorgan232,Cool historical lighthouse,"It was interesting to learn the history of the lighthouse and the caretakers, and about the progression of different types of lights used for lighthouses through history. They had the rooms set up as the people would have lived in them. So interesting to imagine living there. And lighthouses are just cool! ",40,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,June 2018

RMrani,Nice History lesson,This was our first time seeing a lighthouse in person and my husband and I really enjoined it. My 6 year old had a lot of questions about how and why a lighthouse was needed and it was fun to give him a little history lesson.  The views are beautiful and the building has been been well kept.,40,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,July 2018
kerimeyers,Beautiful views and fun history,"We chose to visit the lighthouse on our last day before heading home. We enjoyed reading about the history of the area with our children, touring the grounds and seeing lighthouse. Before leaving we went down to the tide pools and explored along the shore. Great experience for the whole family.",50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,July 2018

dhbourke,Favorite place in San Diego,We love this stretch of beach because it's a wonderful place to bring the family. The surf is gentle and the beach is huge at low tide. Fun to walk down to Scripps Pier if the tide is out. The park has nice play equipment for younger children as well as public bathrooms and showers. There are some beach shops and casual restaurants nearby. Parking is very difficult but it's worth paying to park in the hotel garage. (La Jolla Shores Hotel.) Do not park in restricted lots or near driveways. Towing is enforced and residents (understandably) do not have much patience.,50,La Jolla Shores Park,February 2019
JenRed2014,Tide pools,"We went to the tide pools way on the north end of the beach past the pier. It’s a great place to see anemones, sea hares, hermit crabs and small fish. This area is mostly an outcropping of craggy rocks. It’s definitely slippery, but that goes with tide pooling! There were not a ton of people here, and there is a lot of safe space to  explore if you have people with you who don’t want to risk slipping. ",50,La Jolla Shores Park,February 2019

KasStL,History and Views,We enjoyed this very much.  With our national parks pass our visit to this historic site was free so we could not lose.  But I am so glad we went.  It is a fascinating lighthouse and the information in the assistant keeper's building was very interesting to me.  The walk from the main visitor center was steep for me so if you are not a great uphill walker consider taking the driveway up and park closer.,50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,May 2018
paulfM8489XZ,A fun interactive trip,Great for kids of all ages. We spent 4 hours wandering around all the many fish exhibits. A favorite was the time we watched the sharks getting fed.,50,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,April 2019
Cami W,Beautiful sunset,The sunset was so beautiful. It was windy when we were there so it was cold. I’d suggest bringing a jacket for when the sun goes down. There was pretty wild flowers just up from the cliffs too. The ocean views are also amazing from here. This would have been better without kids because they tend to get bored waiting for the sun to go down.,50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,April 2019

Dan F,Beautiful views from a great lighthouse,"The lighthouse is a great place to visit for history and just to see it.

This is a low key attraction with outstanding instructional opportunities and remarkable views of the harbor, the city, the airport and the naval facility.

AshleyI724,Excellent Safe Beach,"La Jolla is a good day out from nearby San Diego. Vey fashionable area with lots of expensive houses. The beach here is long, wide, flat and safe with rolling surf. You can walk a long way down past Scripps Oceanography Institue (well worth a stroll around). Limited facilities and no locker storage however and the toilets on the day we visited were dirty and some unusable. Nearby are the excellent shores hotel for drinks and happy hour and avenida de la  playa where lots of restaurants and also hire shops for kayaks and surf boards. I recommend doing the coastal walk starting from near palomar and Neptune streets which takes you all the way around the coast past about 11 beaches and coves - just google la Jolla coastal walk for directions- it takes you to the cove and the cave store (barely worth the $5 to view) and takes around 1-2 hours and you finish at the Shores for a swim.

Nicole V,Breathtaking!,"This view of the Pacific is not to be missed during your San Diego trip!  Whether visiting during the day or at sunset, Sunset Cliffs is really a spectacular natural beauty.  Make sure to bring a jacket--it is chilly by the water!  Totally worth the drive!",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,March 2019
someone_actually,"Excellent, but too scary for Mom","Perpetually worried my teens were going to misstep and plummet into the sea, so that put a damper on my fun. Everyone else loved it. Best sunset photography. Crowded, limited parking. Don't take pets or small children as this place is seriously dangerous throughout and packed with people.",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,March 2019
bullwinklej_moose619,Perfect Place to watch the sunset,"Amazing place for a nice walk to watch the sunset and look at beautiful houses. Can get traffic heavy, but still worth it! ",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,September 2018

Marcia C,Interesting Aquarium at Scripps,"We arrived early in the day and though the aquarium  is interesting, it appears to be centered around the interests of young folks, which is a good. There are three areas to visit, one is the actual walkway for the viewing of under water life, the other is the walkway for learning about how the scientists and workers actually do the work above and below the water.  Lots of on hand learning for youngsters and oldsters alike. ",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,March 2019
Chiefmlw,Educational,We took our grandkids there for the day. Not too crowded. Very educational and interesting for all ages. ,50,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,September 2018
buffaloflats,Was expecting more...,We stayed for about 45 mins.  Glad we paid less than $10 to get in!  Would not go back again unless we got there when they opened.,30,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,February 2019
n2r49rs,Fell short of our expectations,"We thought it would have been larger and had more larger exhibits or viewing windows. When you enter nearly all of the stuff to see is on the right side. The highlight was clearly the large octupus. It was very interesting to watch it move and it was getting rubbed by a staff member which it clearly enjoyed. There were many other interesting exhibits representing different areas of the oceans...northern, to sub-tropical to tropical. Most of these had fairly small windows where maybe 3-5 people can see at one time if you want to be up close. The kelp forest tank was also a highlight...2 stories tall. Really enjoyed that too. Not much happening in the outdoor tide pool area. On the other side is a lot of educational stuff more designed for kids. There is also the shark tank on this side which was pretty good but thought it would be better. We were here for maybe an hour to 90 minutes. I am comparing against the Monterey aquarium which is vastly better.",30,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,March 2019
PAAnnR,kayaking into caves,We were with a kayaking group and were able to go into one of the caves.  It was a great experience. Would love to do it again.,50,La Jolla Caves,May 2017
uhdnj,Don't waste your money,"Went in cost $5.00 per person to walk down a large flight of stairs to watch waves come in the inlet. It's dark and damp, to dark to take photos. Didn't think it was that exciting. Maybe if the waves were bigger.",20,La Jolla Caves,April 2018
jenniferbM6783MM,A unique experience!,La Jolla caves are amazing. They give you a close spot to see the seals as well as get in some good pictures. ,50,La Jolla Caves,August 2017

jrk9789,Great view,Your visiting a place that guided many ships in the past. A waypoint of navigation for ships passing the west coast. An interesting historical spot and there’s a nice park for a picnic..a very peaceful spot with a magnificent view,30,Cabrillo National Monument,July 2019
Lingang,A must visit place in San Diego,"This is a small park located on the end of a peninsula. It offers magnificent view of San Diego bay and pacific oceans, you can see Mexico, Tijuana as well. It is the paradise for those who love photography. It also offers nature trial and sea shore cliff with tide pool. Kids all love this place and you can spend half day there easily.",50,Cabrillo National Monument,July 2019
lanthut,My favorite place to visit,"I have been here too many times with friends and family.  Every we have guests visit from other states, we take them here.  I live the weather here, also the water is beautiful blue.  My son loves this place because of its nice little history of San Diego.",50,Cabrillo National Monument,July 2019
barkus1968,Tide Pools and expansive vistas ,This is one amazing national monument. The tide pools at low tide allow you to walk among the barnacles and watch the crabs scamper about. The lighthouse band military history exhibits are informative and beautiful to photograph. The panoramic views of San Diego and Coronado Beach are impressive.  The flowers and natural setting is worth seeing. ,50,Cabrillo National Monument,July 2019
Luis S,A must see while in San Diego!,"Very nice small national park along the bay in the San Diego.  We were first time visitors and we were glad we made time to visit when we left.  It offers beautiful views of the bay and downtown San Diego.  The lighthouse and the information about the history of lighthouses was pretty cool.  They even had a replica of the Spanish galleon, the San Salvador, one of the three ships led by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, sailing in the bay the afternoon of our visit.",50,Cabrillo National Monument,July 2019

thewesterntrek,Lots to do,"The most popular thing about this park is the zoo. I wish I would have more days to explore the architecture and the other museums. If you are an art person, plan one day for the zoo, and one or two more for the garden and surrounding museums. Plan for a lot of walking. We used electric scooters, but they max out at 7mph in the park and surrounding areas for safety purposes. ",40,Balboa Park,October 2019
caineuk1,Great place to walk and run with many attractions,"This is a world class park to run. I include Hyde park, Englisher Gardens, Kings Park in Perth. Definitely a runners mecca; as it has everything. Loads of steep inclines, long flat's, a desert section and really can be a mellow or very exhaustive run. Not to mention all of the attractions; San Diego Zoo, Spreckles Organ (largest in the world), loads of festivals and much much more. The only downside is the homeless (but hopefully the State / Government start to deal with this). 5 stars everytime.",50,Balboa Park,October 2019
S R,"Nice place to visit, but very busy!","There is lots to see and do here, but be prepared to do a lot of walking.  The food is also a tad expensive and there isn't much  to chose.  Would still recommend you spend some time here...just make sure to have comfortable shoes.",30,Balboa Park,October 2019
jackjoiner46,Fantastic ,Very impressed not the biggest park I have seen but beautiful gardens and man made structures well worth the visit and most of the attractions are free ,50,Balboa Park,October 2019
ragtoprt,Great beach,Was there in nice weather in late December. Very few people and the waves were record height. The water was cool but the surfers were still taking advantage of the nice waves. Was fun watching them. Was very enjoyable walking on the wide clean beach. A great little park connected to the beach that would be wonderful for a family picnic.,50,La Jolla Shores Park,December 2018
CantTan,Scenic and a Family-Friendly,"This is a large beach with a deep sandy area.  There are few shells on this beach, so the sand is soft to your feet.  Palm trees surround the beach area.  There are stone benches and picnic tables on grassy areas.  Many people brought lunch and snacks to enjoy in these areas.  There are public restrooms and outdoor showers, but there are few of each and lines were waiting at each.  There are waves for some beginner surfer s to ride, but there is plenty of calm water for children to play.  As with every beach, hold onto your food, and do not feed the seagulls!  These birds are aggressive and will pull food right out of your hands!  This beach is worth the walk or drive.  It has a nic3 space for family gatherings or groups of friends to meet.  Plenty of people were throwing frisbees or playing volleyball.",40,La Jolla Shores Park,January 2019

leo j,It is not what you may think it is today.,The seals have taken it over. It is a great place to view the surf from very safe walkways and you get a great feel for the power of the surf crashing against the wall and rocks. ,50,Children's Pool,January 2019
heidiz996,Fun to see the seals,"We were there in January so this beach was closed to humans, but covered with the seals and their pups. It was fun to watch them and listen to them.  ",40,Children's Pool,January 2019

Henry W,Best views in town , ,50,Cabrillo National Monument,June 2019
PitaBella,Beautiful lighthouse,"Since we dint have a car we rented Uber and then realized there is an entrance fee of $10 per person. The view of the city from the view point was nice , since it was cloudy we missed out on the complete view. The lighthouse is interesting with display of the original light and the staged house. It was also interesting to know that there were women operating some of the lighthouse in USA. I enjoyed the visit but the felt that the entrance fee was a bit high. I recommend to carry some food and water. We did not have enough time to do the trails around but it looked like an interesting hike.",30,Cabrillo National Monument,June 2019

Bchgrl9,Fun Stop to Jump off a Cliff or Watch Others!,"Lots of free parking but muddy and rutted when we were there. I was fun watching folks prepare and then literally run off the cliff.  Everyone seemed to know how to ""steer"" the glider and we spent about 30 -40 minutes watching them all.  Black's (nude) Beach is below, so it's a popular venue!",40,Torrey Pines Gliderport,March 2019
clamdiger2,Happy Photographer,"I am not into jumping off a cliff but I like to watch people jump off a cliff.  I wanted to photograph  something different with color.  I really enjoyed the views. Iiked that they had a little spot to get something to eat nothing fancy.  Spent about 2 hours photography the Hang gliders, small planes and off course the hangliders.  Parking is in a dirt parking lot. Bathrooms are outhouses. I found this place friendly and interesting.",40,Torrey Pines Gliderport,March 2019
Celine315,Fun to watch,"We spent about an hour at the glider port yesterday. Lots of guys suited up waiting for the right wind, but only a few of them jumped.

ekelleman88,So beautiful,Definitely go here! Very picturesque scenery. I even enjoyed seeing the beautiful homes that are located across the street. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and it was not too crowded. I'm not sure how crowded it gets near sunset so it may be a bit hard to find parking. An uber would be a good choice.,50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,April 2019
994jeffreye,Wow!,Seeing the sunset here really is amazing! You can sit on a cliff and watch the sunset as the waves crash around you. I went during high tide so it was cool to see the ocean hit the rocks and spray up and over the cliffs. Parking can get rough if your driving. ,50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,April 2019

cindylu52,Very nice aquarium.,"Took the grandkids and they loved it. On a bluff overlooking La Jolla pier. Small restaurant and gift shop. The outdoor restaurant had surprisingly large portions (burgers, chicken tenders, fries, soft drinks). It is an enjoyable morning or afternoon as it doesn’t take that long to go thru. Free parking.",50,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,March 2019
Tina B,just ok,we are torn whether we feel it was worth $5. and the 145 steps to get down to the bottom.  We did it... looked at the water and walked back up.  Really can only have a couple people down at a time or you cannot get good views.. tight quarters.  ,30,La Jolla Caves,May 2018
SandyRiver,Worth a visit,"This listing includes several experiences and is a bit confusing.   You can walk along the cliffs for free and see beautiful views and the dramatic cave openings.   You can pay for a kayak trip to access the caves a little more closely from the water, and you can also pay $5 each to climb through a carved tunnel through the rock to a small platform inside one of the caves.   ""Enter through the gift shop"" as they say.  If stairs are hard for you, don't feel badly about missing the paid option, although we did enjoy it.",40,La Jolla Caves,February 2018
denvergal1994,Sunny Jim Caves,We did the Sunny Jim Cave. Be prepared with the right shoes because you have to climb down stairs into the cave then back up. It cost $5 and we found free two hour parking right outside. Pretty view at the bottom.,50,La Jolla Caves,May 2018

There is a small gift shop there as well if you want to buy a little souvenier. Then, if time allows, go visit the lighthouse (short walk, but a bit of an incline) and maybe you can catch a glimpse of a whale as it swims by beyond the cliffs of the lighthouse. Finally, drive down to the tide pools for more views and great pictures. You may need to allow 2 to 3 hours to see and do it all. Enjoy!",50,Cabrillo National Monument,May 2019

crayolabird,Be Sure to Visit the Tidepools!,"I was so glad we'd brought along our water shoes!  It was a hassle to change them back when they were all sandy at the car but it really helped them with the slipperiness of the rocks and the sharp bits of sand.

The lighthouse is a great little piece of history.  Neat to see,50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,June 2018
Linda S,Unbelievably beautiful view from the lighthouse,"This old lighthouse takes you back in time. It appears as if its residents just walked away from their home, leaving it looking like it did when they were living there and were the light keepers. Great display, lots of history, amazing views of the bay, Coronado and downtown San Diego. There's a bit of a walk to get there from the parking lot, but worth it.  Don't miss this Point Loma historical building! If you're lucky, you'll see one of the tall ships...maybe even the Star of India...sailing in the bay.",50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,May 2018

Duquesadiner,Great for families,"North of La Jolla Cove you will find La Jolla Shores Park. This is a really safe swimming environment for children and there is a lot to sea.

Randy2353,Great to watch,"Once you walk up to the site it is beautiful.  It is very cool to watch the action as they leap off the cliff.

Very cool to see.",30,Torrey Pines Gliderport,December 2018

It was small but has some very interesting specimins. My kids loved the interactive areas and they are 17 and 22.  There are tide pools and a shark exhibit as well. They also host events and there was a prom taking place this night. All super close to la jolla beaches so we took a stroll and visited childrens pool beach to see the sea lion babies as well. Will visit again im certain.  ,40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,May 2019
joemY3087XB,Nice aquarium,"The Birtch Aquarium is definitely worth a visit. If you are expecting a large aquarium like Monterey Bay or Atlanta, you will be disappointed.

We would go again if we come back this way.",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,May 2019

It was a nice, small aquarium but quite enjoyable.",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,April 2019

wcshepherd2,A must see location.,The Cave at the Cove is a well known site with beautiful views and cliffs.  One can pay a small fee in the gift shop and walk down a tunnel staircase to the cove opening.  Another option is to take a stroll along the bluff top.  The path is about half to three quarters of a mile and not crowded.  Great experience what every one chooses,50,La Jolla Caves,August 2017
Lori985,Watch your head!,The entrance started in the store.  We went straight down the steep small wet steps.  Be careful to duck .We went to a small platform at the bottom.  It was cool to see the cave though.  We saw kayakers outside.,40,La Jolla Caves,June 2018
Jen S,This attraction is not about the gift shop access!,"You DO NOT need to pay the gift shop to see the cave. In fact if that's all you did then you only saw the inside of one cave and missed all the other natural beauty in the immediate area. Forget the gift shop. Walk out to the cave through the little door at the end of the free stairway (on top of the cave), and climb down to the right side of the cave. There are seven smaller caves here and great snorkeling. You can bring your own snorkel gears or if you are a strong swimmer come here to get away from the crowd at the Cove.",50,La Jolla Caves,July 2018
lilsorrel,Beautiful views with some history included ,"Glad we visited this national park during our trip to SD. $20 entry fee, credit/debit card preferred at entrance.

lslv,over priced,"20 bucks from the State to see a lighthouse, is greedy beyond words, I have seen it a number of times in the past, but I feel it is not worth the 20 they want, I don't have a problem spending money, but it is over priced",30,Cabrillo National Monument,August 2019
L7502LBdavidh,Cabrillo ,One of San Diego most beautiful views and you can see such a nice scenery from above the highest spots in town! A movie will show you much about San Diego and all of it's history with the lighthouse and all of the nice items at the house itself in which it has all the original items still there...spending an afternoon there will be a delight for any size family.,50,Cabrillo National Monument,June 2018
255terrencet,First Visit,This visit was suggested by a good friend that lives in the San Diego area. There is a small museum on site and lots of walking trails. Most of the trails are easy to moderate. You can go down  to the tide pools to see animal life. Be sure to bring water if you do some of the longer trails. You visit the lighthouse on site that no longer in use. Lots of neat little exhibits in the building. There are also military observation bunkers on the site. One of the bunkers is open and manned by one of the park personnel. He will you provide you with a lot of great information about it. On weekends you should get there early...like 9am. It gets really crowded on a nice day. I got there at 9 by accident because we had a full day planned. Left the park without seeing 50% or more of it around 11am. There was a really long line of cars trying to get in. I will be definitely be going back to explore some more.,50,Cabrillo National Monument,August 2019

Maggie K,Come watch the seals sunbathe,"The beach is blocked off so the seals can rest undisturbed. Its a wonderful place to observe them in the wild.

treyk453,Great place to see seals.,This is more about the experience of seeing harbor seals up close and personal. The cove is cool and I am sure it is great in the off-seal season but in the winter you can see about 50 seals bathing in the sun and swimming. The man-made structure is perfect for viewing them up close. There are nearby beaches and tide pools to play around in as well.,50,Children's Pool,March 2019

The most nerve wracking part was actually running off the cliff for take off, the rest was smooth and you just enjoyed the ride! You got to see so many beautiful homes, golf courses and of course you can see the beautiful waves of the beach.

Called in morning and found it flights looked good so we headed down put our names on the list and within 30 minutes we where called on our phone to return as wind was good. It was $165 each and then $30 for pictures and $50 for a video. The pilots are so good and explain everything to you and point out all the sights from above. You never feel unsafe. Just do it! ,50,Torrey Pines Gliderport,April 2019

ransom007,Good aquarium by the University of California at San Diego,"The aquarium has free parking. The aquarium has a knowledgeable staff. I felt that one fish tank observation area was dangerously dark. I bumped into an individual because I didn't see him before (or after) I bumped into him. When I looked further into the area, I just turned around and walked out. I went into another exhibition area and the lighting was much better. There were plenty of seahorses, sea dragons and jellies. There is also a shark observation area (leopard sharks). There are quite a few hands-on exhibits for younger guests to enjoy. There is a good gift shop and a cafe.",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,June 2019

June K,Crowded but worth the wait,"We took a kayak tour to see the caves. It was very congested, with groups from several tour companies, plus lots of snorkelers. Kayaks can only go in two at a time, and groups of snorkelers often prevent entry. Had to wait quite a long time for out turn, drifting away and having to paddle back toward entrance. Nonetheless, we really enjoyed watching the sea lions basking and interacting on the rocks while we waited - and once inside the cave, it was definitely worth it.",50,La Jolla Caves,July 2018

designerista,Enjoyable!,"I think there are approximately 150 steps down the cave and then up again. But it is breathtaking when you get down there.  You enter through a gift shop, get your ticket, and then go down the stairs.  It was well lit and it was easy to climb back up again.  ",50,La Jolla Caves,January 2018

wkmoon,Great views and interesting lighthouse history,"The paths around the lighthouse and visitor center are paved and well-marked. There are also hiking paths and trails to explore.  We were there about an hour, partly due to a tired 5 year old, but if you are there at low tide and can check out the tide pools, I imagine you could spend 2-3 hours here.

Howard105,Beautiful Views with Lots to Explore,"Cabrillo National Monument is on a cliff at the end of Point Loma.  Start at the Visitors Center to find out what is happening that day nd what is recommended.  The people at the information desk were very helpful.  Check out the views of San Diego and the Pacific Ocean.  Then tour the lighthouse for a little history and more views.  If the WWII bunker is open, check out where our troops watched the entrance to the San Diego Harbor and Navy base, looking for submarines.  If you are at or near low tide, check out the tide pools.  And lots of hiking as well.  And lots of flowers, considering how dry and windy it is up there.  The admission is $20 per car, and well worth it.  We used our Senior National Parks Pass, so admission was free.  (Senior Passes are available at the park.)  Plan on spending at least half a day.  Take your time and enjoy this wonderful site.",50,Cabrillo National Monument,August 2019

denverista,Consider the Explorer Pass and Get the App,"I had purchased separate admission tickets to 3 museums before I realized that the Explorer Pass might have saved me money, so check that out. Also, the App is useful to help you get your bearings. Be aware that food options near the central square area are rather limited. The Prado restaurant is good, but it is definitely a sit-down place and might not be on budget for a family. It would be a good place to bring a simple picnic lunch.",50,Balboa Park,November 2019

One just happened to be dead, (bummer).  There were twenty to thirty seals there including adults and pups.   They were very cute and picture taking was great.  Clean restrooms were available as well.  Overall a good experience.  The beach is closed from January to May 15th because of the baby seals being born.  ",40,Children's Pool,May 2019

Chiefyn1,Awesome ,"This place is either under construction as the parking area is completely closed. You have to find street parking and walk into the park. The walk areas are uneven and could be touted as unsafe.  Multiple areas taped off for safety. However, if you can get to the cliffs through unsteady paths then you are in for a treat!! The signs say that the ground is unstable at the edge but you can stay back plenty far and still get awesome pics!  If you bring a lunch then you can indulge in a little piece of heaven.  The surf sounds and tide pools are beautiful!  Definitely worth a visit!",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,June 2019

sanyramirez,Peaceful ,Amazing location! If you go to see sunset get there at least 25 minutes before! It gets crowded and parking can be difficult.

It cost to go down into the caves, but the coves are nearvy and all over La Jolla. It is stinky at times though.. Some mornings the odor from the fish and birds can be quite much, but the views from any of the hills tops is so worth it.. ",40,La Jolla Caves,July 2018
satellitesue1,Short and Sweet,I wanted to go kayaking and visit the cave that way but it was chilly for September and the waves were pretty big so I paid the five dollar entrance fee and went in through the Cave Store. There are a lot of steps but I enjoyed my quick visit into the cave. I was the only one in there and I got a few nice shots of the interior of the cave and the light shining in from the sea.  My husband waited outside and I think I spent ten minutes total in the cave.,40,La Jolla Caves,September 2018

The tour leaves from LaJolla Shores beach (a hidden GEM itself) and a guide navigates you to the caves near LaJolla Cove.  It is an AMAZING experience and you DO NOT have to be experienced with Kayaks to do this!,50,La Jolla Caves,October 2018

Sue2000000,Disappointing after visiting Florida outlets,"From downtown San Diego this was easily accessible via the public trolley for just $5 per person, per day.  After alighting the trolley, there is a 10 - 15 minute walk to get there.  Although easy enough, signposting could be better.  If you've ever visited the Florida outlets you may find this a bit disappointing - I certainly did and only bought one thing the whole day.  This is an outdoor outlet (so sunscreen needed) and feels 'old.'  As most outlets, it depends what's there on the day.  I was really looking forward to a good shop but this outlet didn't do it for me - I was really disappointed.  My partner, on the other hand, did really well out of the Hilfiger shop and came away with a big bag of bargains.",30,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,September 2011

Patti B,Something for everybody,"We only spent one day at the park, and I think you'd need at least two or three to do anything more than scratch the surface.   The art museum had some surprisingly renown artists, and the Sculpture Garden was a wonderful place to eat lunch.   We spent about 90 minutes strolling the Japanese Friendship Garden, but it was so peaceful and beautiful that we easily could have spent twice as much time there.  If you have kids 12 and under, I'd recommend the Science Center.  It has many ways for kids to amuse themselves and there's even a 30 minute movie about hero dogs that is the perfect way to grab some time off your feet. And pay a visit to the Artists' Village.  It's a colorful and unique experience.",50,Balboa Park,October 2019

alohastitch,THE place to watch seals,"I know this place was originally constructed for children and the seals have taken it over, but there is another small cove right behind this one that the families seem to use and it is amazing how much time you can spend just watching the seals.  One night we watched them at sunset and the next morning we watched them lay on the beach until one by one they slid into the water.  They have become a wonderful tourist attraction and it is fun to see them interact with each other.  Families seem to be respectful and keep their distance.  I heard more than one family remark to their children that these were wild seals and not to get too close to them.  It's amazing to see them and know they can come and go as they please.  I know some locals don't want them there but they seem to bring joy to all who just spend time observing them.",50,Children's Pool,May 2019

ShruberyOne,A pleasant surprise,"A beautiful, serine place. Came across this park by accident looking for Torrey Pines preserve. Great watching the various hanggliders I sour back and forth silently in this gourgous clifside location.",50,Torrey Pines Gliderport,March 2019
481bryand,Amazing experience ,"What an amazing experience. John was my instructor and was excellent at Explaining everything throughout the flight. Beautiful scenery and flew like a bird. I’m 63 years old and was an easy thing to do, jumping off a cliff is nuts but highly recommend it. Wound do it again. to anyone. ",50,Torrey Pines Gliderport,July 2019
isadabrowska,Holiday Highlight,"The cliffs and its views were amazing, but sunset made for breathtaking views!",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,July 2019
memeh613,Uber romantic view during sunset!,"I almost wanted to hug my friend when I was there, because it's just so romantic :) it's natural cliff and beautiful sunset, the ocean, what more can you ask for?! ",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,May 2019
BuckeyeTripReviewer,Sunset Location,This is the place to go to watch the sunset. It was very crowded but worth it. There are several places to sit on benches and on the cliffs. ,40,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,July 2019
BWH999,The Name Says it All,Lovely place to hike and take the dog.  Tidepools.  Great sunsets! Where I go down it is a little steep.  Walking stick might be helpful.,50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,December 2018
ameliorate_world,Scenic ocean views and dirt trails,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't hard to find parking along the coast. The views are pretty and you can hike along the cliffs with a nice ocean breeze. The trail is very dusty though so be prepared for your shoes to get dirty! You can access the ocean via various trails and stairs down to the water as well. Some of the trails are ""under rehabilitation"" and the sections further away from the water were less pleasant. Overall I recommend it.",40,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,July 2019
Jeanne T,Great for Grand-kids,My first trip to the aquarium with my grand-kids was nice and educational for all of us. The kids especially enjoyed the Sea dragons and the interactive kids areas.,40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,July 2019
johnsonjanice2306,Great Experience,This is a smaller aquarium but not to be missed. It is especially ideal for younger children. It has lots of interaction. Very nice collection!,50,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,August 2019
Luv2Travel92124,A Great Experience for All Ages,"I took my 18-year old granddaughter and her friend who were visiting from Colorado, and they enjoyed it very much, as did I, though I've been there before.  I think they have added the ""hands-on"" experience for younger children since I was there last, or at least it seemed new to me.  It was a little too ""young"" for my granddaughter and her friend, but they enjoyed the aquarium displays and especially enjoyed being able to actually touch the sea urchins, etc. in the tidepool exhibit.  We had lunch at the café outside, and that was okay.  All in all, a pleasant experience for everyone.",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,August 2019
selimw2016,Sooooo disappointing,"Visiting the Birch Aquarium at Scripps I expected a first rate aquarium able to rival the great aquariums of the world. Especially as this is situated on the San Diego coast, San Diego home to the world famous zoo, but I was deeply disappointed as I could easily compare it to a collection of some sea life in small aquariums with the exception of one ceiling to floor, about 20 feet tall, aquarium. There fee of $19.50 is not worth it. Go and observe sea lions at La Jolla cove for free or rent a kayak and watch the sea lions swim around you. Truly a waste of time and money in my opinion.",20,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,July 2019
BSinPNS,"Small, but Nice","First time visit for our grandson.  Loved the hand-on exhibits while we enjoyed the magnificent views of the coast.  If possible, I would avoid the summer time as there are lots of camps and day cares visiting.  The aquarium is actually quite small.",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,August 2019
wetears,sun days at the caves,"wonderful gift shop,  caves make for a fun outing,  worth waiting for a parking space just to experience this area",50,La Jolla Caves,November 2018
youcanhandlethetruth,It is impossible to drive or park in that area.,"While the caves are interesting, and the view is gorgeous, you are going to suffer some disappointment because it is hard to park, and there are hundreds of hotels around with lots of people. Not good. You better drive to Point Loma, or go to Mission Bay in San Diego. Turists have killed this place.",30,La Jolla Caves,November 2018
Jessica C,Surprise,You take 140 steps which is light up and the store has cameras in case anyone has an issue along the way.  Then you feel like you are in the Goonies movie and come out to a great view for some nice pics.,50,La Jolla Caves,December 2018
Carrie C,Natures Beauty,"Such a cool spot with so much to do.  Sea caves, beautiful shore line and ocean views and of course the seals and sea lions.  Parking is a bit tricky but we found parking up the hill near the shops easier and it was just a short walk (a a few..well alot..of steps)  Must see in the area!",50,La Jolla Caves,December 2018
holeinone17,Great for both sightseeing and kayaking,"This is a great place to simply take in the beautiful shoreline along La Jolla and it's neighboring communities, or go all out and get in a kayak to traverse the caves.  Something for everyone, so you can't go wrong!",50,La Jolla Caves,December 2018
AlexaS365,Beautiful View,"The drive there is nice.  The monument is truly a place to see you... shouldn't miss it, unfortunately there is a park entrance fee.  The lighthouse on site has plenty of history.  There is a shop, a theatre for short films of interest, batbrooms.  Handicapped accessible, plenty of parking.  On a clear day you can even see Mexico.",50,Cabrillo National Monument,May 2019
channonr2015,Fantastic views ,There are also various walking trails for the fitter and more adventurous visitor.,40,Cabrillo National Monument,October 2019
avd_travel,Amazing views,"This is at the end of Point Loma and is one of the highest points in the city so you get amazing views of the city, bay, and ocean. The history of the light house and area was cool, but the views were really the show stopper. There are also some tide pools if you are here at low tide, but they close at 4:30. Another cool thing is your admission ticket is good for a week after purchase!",40,Cabrillo National Monument,October 2019
DeputyDogCLT,The View!!,Had an hour to kill before flight out. Definitely the thing to do.  Local coffee shop owner in La Jolla recommended it.  ,50,Cabrillo National Monument,October 2019
Skwiki,Feels like Mexico without having to cross the border,The only reason we came here was my son wanted to go close to the Mexican border . He was excited just seeing so many Mexican license plates in the parking lot ! This is simply a typical outlet mall . It has been very clean on every visit  . The shave ice kiosk was perfect on a hot day . For us living so far away from Mexico there is a little thrill knowing we are just a stone's throw away .,40,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,August 2013
Megahaole,Mainly for Mexican visitors,"This a slightly above-average outlet mall, worth a trip from Tijuana but not from L.A. or North (San Diego) County. It's nice, clean, safe. The clerks are typical Mexican retail workers - bilingual, courteous, reasonably efficient, but a little glum. The prices are nothing to write home (U.S.) about. I go there for the food! There are some nice restaurants on the periphery (not the food court).",30,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,December 2013
VINEET C,Great shopping experience on the border of USA / MEXICO,"Nice feeling, must go when in San Diego.",40,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,December 2013
smhr,Good place to shop,"This is a huge outlet mall very close to the Mexican border. We got some good deals here. In addition to visiting the mall, you can also visit the Mexican town in San Diego. This town is about 5 mins from here and on the west of the mall",40,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,March 2014
sosb528,Best Outlets Anywhere,"For my daughters soccer team we are always in San Diego for tournaments.  We always make plans to go to the outlets in San Ysidro.  We always find deals and leave with lots of bags.  The prices can't be beat.  For us, our favorites are the Under Armor and No Fear stores.  Lots of walking and shopping and shoppers from everywhere.  This is a really nice place.  It's clean, plenty of restrooms and lots to eat too.  We have shopped a lot of outlets but none compare to this place.  The best deals are here.",50,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,November 2013
SDTravelMom,The lighthouse is a must see,This is one of the few opportunities on the West Coast to actually go inside a light house. Be sure to go next door as well. There is so much history and so much to learn.  Exhibits are very well done.  Location/views are amazing.  Even young children can appreciate the exhibits.  Stairwell inside is tight spiral. If you don't like tight spaces it may not be for you.  But surrounding area is awesome.  One of my favorite places.,50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,March 2019
Terry L,Beautiful Park !,"There is a huge dog park on the western side of the Cabrillo Bridge, a number of people were letting their dogs play and have fun there.",50,Balboa Park,November 2019
sdtoonces,Beautiful!,"I live within walking distance so I am here A LOT. I never get tired of it sometimes I have a picnic in the rose garden. I bring my dogs here all the time. There is always something going on. Lots of street performers, art, culture and beauty. A must see while visiting America's Finest City. If you live here like me, on Tuesdays specific museums are free so that is why Tuesdays get a bit crowded. They also have December nights a huge Christmas spectacle. I love hanging out at the Koi ponds and botanical building there are little creatures everywhere like duckling, turtles, fish, and bunnies.",50,Balboa Park,October 2019
AnielaSS,Excellent,"This park offers many experiences. Botanical garden, outdoor organs, museums, theaters, lush grounds. Read about the history of Balboa park, it is very interesting. ",50,Balboa Park,November 2019
leslas16,Balboa park,Great place lots of walking the gardens were just beautiful different museums to look at the fountain,50,Balboa Park,October 2019
KodoDrummer,Beautiful place for a relaxing walk,"Lots to see in the park with its Mexican-Spanish architecture, Japanese gardens, cultural arts, and more, blended in. ",50,Balboa Park,November 2019
Cheryl M,Busy but still room to enjoy the ocean,"We went on Saturday 7/8 and it was crowded, but there was still room for us to find a good spot to lay out a blanket and enjoy the ocean. There is a playground and restrooms. Well worth the visit.",40,La Jolla Shores Park,July 2019
Scotland222,Love this Beach!,"The La Jolla Shores is a nice clean beach with a lot of friendly people enjoying the same things we all love about the beach. The water is clear, the kids are building sand castles and I love just walking along the shore with my feet in the water. The beach is my happy place and this one is no exception. For me, just sitting on my beach chair and basking in the beautiful California sun is more then enough for me. While I was there, it was not like it is in the summer months. The crowds were not in full bloom yet. It was sunny, people were playing frisbee and it was just a beautiful day on the beach.",50,La Jolla Shores Park,March 2019
468rann,nice sandy beach,plenty of space in the morning.,50,La Jolla Shores Park,July 2019
Leesuzy71,Seals cubs!,Lovely way to see the seal cubs whilst having fun on the beach. The seals kept a respectable distance but were close enough for us to see them sunbathing and playing. The beach is small and gets busy with tourists. There are toilets and showers available and free parking for 2 hours. Get there early to get parking though!,50,Children's Pool,July 2019
johnsonjanice2306,Lovey Destination,This was initially designed as a protected area for swimming. But for many years the seals and sea lions find it ideal. In fact is is closed for pup season. Don't let this deter you. You can walk on the railed seawall for spectacular views and enjoy a close up (and safe) view of the seals and sea lions- and pups. Follow the posted directions and respect them from the sanded side. Visitors and locals of all ages are charmed by this spot in lovely San Diego.,50,Children's Pool,July 2019
827martinob,Great cove ,Lovely clean cove for kids and families to relax and a few seals on the rocks along the way stunning scenic place ,50,Children's Pool,August 2019
MB B,No longer a great way to watch seals,"The reason why I rated the pool as I did was:  I wouldn't take my children into water that had been classified as unsanitary due to the fecal material left by the seals; it's not particularly a place I would associate with ""nature"" since it is just a beach now; and parking can be a little tricky since that area is usually pretty crowded so accommodating a large group might be difficult.",20,Children's Pool,August 2019
kelleyaelliott,loved!,"There were more sea lions at La Jolla Cove than here, but it looked like a fun area to swim and have a great day!",40,Children's Pool,August 2019
Pras499,Amazing,"This place is amazing.   Packed with people, located in the nicest part of San Diego IMHO.   Quite an experience.",50,Torrey Pines Gliderport,July 2019
Miss_Marino-Tauhinu,Amazingly beautiful,Went to watch the gliders just before sunset and it looked absolutely amazing. The instructors were very handson and made everyone feel safe.,50,Torrey Pines Gliderport,July 2019
Reslimpan,Amazing even without being on a glider,This is an amazing place to visit even if you like us have no intention of going up in the air. Stunning views and nice little hikes along the cliffs. Simply just a very beautiful place to visit ,50,Torrey Pines Gliderport,July 2019
Thomas R,Free views of beautiful pacific coast,"If your looking for something to do in San Diego that has free parking and some of the most stunning views of the Pacific Ocean, this is the place. On the cliff's above the famous Blacks Beach is a grassed area known as the Glider port where 1 and 2 persons glider take off to soar the cliffs above the ocean. The store is off grid and closes prior to sun going down but it's a great place to have a picnic with tables and grass areas. Bring chairs it you want to watch the hang gliders prepare and take off. Hiking the cliffs is also an option. All this is FREE.",40,Torrey Pines Gliderport,May 2019
gettinaway,What an experience.,Don't miss this! It is well worth the cost because you don't get this opportunity very often in your life.  What a blast!!!,50,Torrey Pines Gliderport,July 2019
steven3ford,Breathtaking adventure ,This is a gem.  Stunning views at sunset and fun little hikes.  There are well groomed paths you can stay on but most people go off of the paths to sit on the edge of the cliffs.  There are several stairways down to the beach and you can climb the rocks and navigate some cool coves.  The main parking lot was under construction but there is plenty of free street parking and smaller lots as you drive north.  I could spend every night here.,50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,August 2019
Chdeia,Teen and Young Child,"This breathtaking place was my favorite of our entire San Diego Trip!  I cannot even begin to explain how beautiful it was. I had to take video of the waves crashing into the rock, too, as I knew I would want to listen back on it when the trip was over. This is a definite must-see, plus it’s close to Cabrillo National Monument and the lighthouse. ",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,August 2019
TerrapinCT,Great spot!,Great views! I would be nervous with small children. Some spots are very dangerous. Definitely worth checking out. Just beautiful,50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,August 2019
ShooterX,A must see for ocean lovers,"Limited parking and some areas were closed due to dangerous erosion. Otherwise, the cliffs are easily accessible and provide spectacular views of the ocean.",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,August 2019
Jo08,Awesome views,This was probably one of the highlights of San Diego. Do not miss this!!,50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,August 2019
allisonf945,Very disappointed ,My son is 2 and absolutely loves aquariums  so we have been to several throughout the US. This aquarium was an extreme disappointment. The exhibits appeared to be large home aquariums. I would not recommend this at all. ,10,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,August 2019
charliek262,Fun Educational Activity ,Gift shop and a restaurant are also onsite.,40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,August 2019
owhatawonderfulworld,Great indoor activity for young children,"We purchased tickets to the aquarium with the Go San Diego Card which gave us a discount.  My husband and I took our almost 4 yo son on a Tuesday to take a break from beach/water activities and be indoors for a bit. Between the shark feeding and kelp tank dive feeding we were able to spend several hours at the aquarium. The aquarium while small is well suited for smaller children (preschool/toddler age) with lots of hands on fun. Lots of volunteers to explain things to the little ones and their parents- we especially enjoyed the tide pools!  Word of advice, the feedings/shows fill up rather quickly and as the spaces are somewhat small plan to arrive 10-15 min early at least to get a good seat.  After you're done at the aquarium make sure you take the quick/easy hike from the parking lot to the ""hidden"" swing of La Jolla to enjoy some spectacular views!",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,August 2019
Passenger33243531095,Small a little pricey,"Fun, easy to walk around for elderly very cool kids displays but a little pricey for size.  Still would go again and recommend.",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,May 2019
stroupp,"Wonderful, exploratory place to visit!",The cafe and gift shop outside the front entrance can be accessed without entering the aquarium. We stopped there just to eat before meeting up with our family.,50,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,August 2019
Chris H,play ball,HUGE! Had no idea. Wide walkways. Not the pushing and shoving you have to deal with in SF. Awesome website. They have a Shade chart to help you pick seats. So many places to get food including salads and other wise choices. Lots of space to hang out and room for kids to run. Big screen very easy to see from all angles and loaded with stats. Clean bathrooms and never had to wait in line to get into one,50,Petco Park,September 2019
MarkS907,Cubs vs Padres,This was a last minutes idea as we were in town and the wife is a Cubs fan. Petco Park is very nice. Great seats behind Cubs dugout. Many food and drink options. ,50,Petco Park,September 2019
Aventura143,Petco Park always fun!,"Love to go to Petco Park because of the Padres of course! But enjoy the ambiance, people are happy, you see families with kids, couples, having a great time. And the food! It’s my favorite part ;-) love the tri tip nachos, bbq sandwiches, hotdogs, churros, peanuts, cracker jack box and a beer and or a margarita. I don’t eat it that all in one visit so a day earlier even a few minutes before still trying to decide! ;-) The humor on the big screens is very cool. The raffle. All! GO!",50,Petco Park,July 2019
patsfreak2002,Fenway Fans,Make sure you head up to the 300 section for sunset!,50,Petco Park,August 2019
guycolle,Disappointing,Because of all the good reviews we took the walk down the 145 steps to that ONE cave. Really!? It's a single cave with a single view out of that cave. And that's it.,20,La Jolla Caves,February 2019
nitinabrol,Close seal experience,This place is famous for seals. The seals come very close to the beach and they are acclimatized to human presence. ,50,La Jolla Caves,February 2019
mmalanis,Beautiful scenic views,Plan it ahead so that you can spend at least half a day and you get to breathe the breeze while enjoying the view.,50,La Jolla Caves,December 2018
Victoria G,Worth 1 hour of you time!,I liked this self type tour.  You  stand on an observation deck watch the water and kayaks going into the cave without hitting the surrounding rocks.  The shell shop just a terrace above the observation deck allows you to walk down into the caves.  There is a cost for this and I think it is worth it.  Life long learners will appreciate seeing the affect erosion from the wind and the water. Fabulous restaurants around this landmark.The shell shop includes some shopping for vacationers.,30,La Jolla Caves,June 2018
Robert C,La Jolla beachfrant and caves,"Easy drive from San Diego, to see shore birds and caves.  Free parking for 3 hours close by, with rest rooms and picnic tables.",40,La Jolla Caves,March 2019

ourhauntedtravels,Great History and Views,"We knew the history behind the monument before we went.   It would of been nice to had someone out at the monument to explain why it was actually there, but you can find out this information in the visitor center.  Most people were just stopping to take photos and really didn't understand the history behind the monument.",40,Cabrillo National Monument,November 2018

D4195XZkeving,Great Views,Splendid views of Naval Air Station Coronado and San Diego.  So much to see including the old lighthouse and quarters.  Be sure to drive down the west side along the ocean.  Watch out for bicyclist climbing the steep road! ,50,Cabrillo National Monument,September 2019
Leslie2812,Lack of customer service,"Lady at the register did not put all my merchandise in my bag. So now I have to go all the way back from Mission Valley to pick up my stuff that she did not put in my bag. How difficult is it to do that job?? Putting merchandise in a bag!! I know it must be challenging!! It was a horrible experience shopping there. Another lady behind me was standing next to me (i mean literally touching my arm) as I was paying, as if I was paying for her stuff too. I will never go to that store again!!

ianwyj,Retail therapy is always good once in a while,"It's a good place to spend a day shopping.  Being responsible conference delegates, we only spent...half a day.  Lots of shops with many well-known brands represented, relatively friendly prices (partly depending on which part of the world you're from), and reasonable food options when hunger pangs are felt.",40,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,January 2015
Hoben01,No need for car to get here,As others have pointed out there is easy access to this outlet mall via the san diego trolley blue line. Its a matter of taking the blue line down to the last stop san ysidro and then waking across a bridge for maybe 200 yards to get to the mall. Its a pretty large layout has all the typical stores. I did find this place had a north face outlet which i rarely run across elsewhere. The nike outlet was really large here a lot bigger then any i've seen in ca. By the way around the area were a number of other midrange stores,40,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,July 2015

Barry B,Unique experience,"Right on San Diego Bay, and easily accessible from several downtown hotels, as well as public transportation.

Check out Power Alley, below the stadium, for food and drink before the game. Huge video scoreboards.",50,Petco Park,August 2019
Dan G,The great place to see a game with family/friends,"Petco Park I think is one of the best ballparks in the MLB. No matter where you sit you get a great view of the game. I love how they respect our military and first responders. And if you buy tickets at the box office on the day of the game, sometimes they are up to 50% off. If you've never been to Petco and a local or visitor I highly recommend you see at least one game.",50,Petco Park,September 2019

Veronica J,A great Museum with awesome views and trails,"We had a great time at the Old Point Loma Lighthouse, A historical place where we first watched a video about wild animals and whales migrating to Baja in the winter. There is also a gift store at the lighthouse which had a great views of the ocean and San Diego.  It is very interesting history of its early beginnings and how the Captain once lived there.  The views and the Ocean is within a short walk was amazing too. Great place to spend with the family. The Museum is free, you only pay $10 per parking car. ",50,Old Point Loma Lighthouse,May 2019
SurreyTravelGal,Wish we had more time to spend there,Very nice park with lots to see.  Wish I knew prior how much there is to see there.  Needed a few more hours.  Certainly a day event.,40,Balboa Park,November 2019
JHughes50,So much to see and definitely worth your time...I would go every time to visit.,"This park has so many things to do, that because of time, we decided to skip the museums and spend most of our time  enjoying the beautiful surroundings and all the spectacular gardens. The one museum we did visit though, is the Timken Museum of Art. It’s free and small enough that you can see everything in less than an hour. I highly recommend. There is also a sculpture garden, but we had missed them at first, so be sure to ask someone. There is a Rodin and a Miro sculpture if that’s your thing. We also loved the Spanish Art Village and even bought a few gifts. The Rose and Cactus gardens were our favorite. The Trees for Health garden was interesting, but it is in the parks far west Mesa and if you have limited time, I would skip. I would also skip the Zoro garden due to time constraints. We wanted to visit the international cottages, but they were closed. We were told that they are open on Saturday’s and Sunday’s. Just enjoy a stroll and the great weather San Diego has to offer...it’s all free. ",50,Balboa Park,November 2019

DebSA22,Wish We Had a Week to Spend Here!,"This is the jewel in San Diego's crown for sure.  Limited on time we spent one day at BP and swore we would return to spend more time here.  If you enjoy the arts, flowers and  outdoor beauty this is the place for you.  We toured the botanical gardens and a couple of the museums and ran out of time to do more.  The parking was very convenient and a shuttle does a big wide loop dropping you off nearby to whatever area you want to go to.  Most amazing is that the areas we visited were free which is very unexpected and appreciated.  We will return with more time to explore.  ",50,Balboa Park,October 2019

Chshrcat873,Red Sox weekend!,"We have been to this park before and it is one of our favorite places to go! There’s numerous places to get food and we haven’t had the same thing twice yet.

Maseratti12,Best ballpark tour in the Majors,"I've taken ballpark tours of pretty much every stadium in MLB that allows them, and Petco's tour is hands down the best of them all. I just did it for a fourth time. Mike was my tour guide (had him three times now). He not only talks about all the details and unique parts of Petco Parkand nods to the SD community, but also covers the construction of the land as well as some history of the Padres and how the history led to Petco being built. I bring new friends on this tour every time I come to SD because, to me, it is just as much of a must-do in SD as the zoo and Balboa Park. Thanks, MIke!",50,Petco Park,August 2019
baseball1008,Very nice Ballpark ,Enjoyed the game at this stadium. It’s in my top 10 stadiums. Has decent food selections to offer. Very clean stadium with all seats facing toward home plate.,50,Petco Park,August 2019

823JamesA,Good not great,A little over hyped in the travel book? Not much to see except one or two seals and a walk along s sea wall. Looked like an ok beach but much better along the coast,30,Children's Pool,August 2019
Rchrisp,Sweet spot,We're from Canada so it was a great treat to show up and find seals right on the rocks!  Our kids went in the water and a seal pup popped up barely 10 feet in front of them! Nice little area.,50,Children's Pool,August 2019

Robin1954,Beautiful but concerning.,"After watching the tandem paragliding go on for a hour or so, I decided to brave it myself.  The wind was not as strong as my pilot desired and he spent much of my ride expressing his concerns.  I was not able to relax as the cliffs are close and very high.  I enjoyed watching others fly much more than my own ride.",30,Torrey Pines Gliderport,August 2019

Barbara F,I Live Here. Beware,"I live here and want to warn visitors to be extra careful around these cliffs. The cliffs are very slippery either by being wet, or dry areas are slippery with gravely unstable ground. People die here. At times, you’ll see kids jumping in the water. It’s sort of a right of passage here. Most know what their doing, but if you are not a strong swimmer, DON’T TRY IT. It’s always nice to have a photo with the ocean behind you, but do not back up to the edge of the cliff. Enjoy the view while experiencing the power of Mother Nature.",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,September 2019

73phyllist,Red Sox game,This baseball park is a great place.  We enjoyed the stadium and all it had to offer.  We ate and purchased beverages. A bit pricey but good variety was offered.  I liked the outdoor venue that the stadium offered as well.  Watching a ballgame was great.  They entertained also with videos and Jumbotron pictures.,40,Petco Park,August 2019
255terrencet,Red Sox in Town,First visit here in my quest to see all of the major league ball parks. I would say this is one of the better stadiums I have been to. Lots of different types of food and drink at the usual ballpark prices. Site lines are real good. Staff is friendly and efficient. Lots of places eat and drink outside the stadium before and after the game. You will need to do a little walking though. ,50,Petco Park,August 2019
KFM214,A beautiful walk along the water. BUT STAY OFF THE CLIFFS.,"I recently went for a walk along Sunset Cliffs, a fragile stretch of coastline, where signs are posted every where to UNSTABLE \CLIFFS. Visitors: be aware that chunks of cliff regularly fall into the water taking a person or two with it. I was shocked to see how many visitors ignored the warning signs: we had another death just last week. If you go, you will be rewarded with gorgeous views, strutting pigeons, and a visit to one of San Diego's oldest beach cities. With it, but observe the signage. ",50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,September 2019

traveler5005,Shark!,The Birch aquarium is part of Scripps and UC Sandiego. Great activity for kids but amazing sights for adults too. 2-3 hours should be enough to see everything. It can be done in a little over an hour. Affordable. ,50,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,September 2019
Coder,Worth a visit,"While this Aquarium is not quite Monterey Bay or Georgia, it is well worth a visit. The exhibits are nicely organized and well lit. There's a pretty awesome kelp forest and jelly fish exhibits and a lot of interactive stuff for kids. There's also an outdoor deck with a great view of La Jolla and the ocean especially on a sunny day. Nice selection of gifts and souvenirs in the gift shop. Again not a big aquarium but worth a visit if you're in the area. Kids will love it.",40,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,September 2019

Julesmulls,It’s a must even if you don’t love baseball! ,Great stadium - my husband and I have made it our mission to go to all the MLB stadiums in our lifetime and this is rating as one of the best along our travels. We have been to four this trip and truly Petco Park has everything to offer. Food services were amazing so much variety and value for money. Plenty of restrooms and no lines. The staff were so kind from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. Definitely worth a visit! ,50,Petco Park,September 2019
MarkR205,Great Stadium,Went to the ball game here at Petco park on a cloudy day when we were in San Diego. What an atmosphere in the stadium even though the game wasn’t good 0-1 dodgers the fans were great,30,Petco Park,September 2019
Diane W,Tour Guide Mike,"Mike made our tour interesting and fun. He was informative and also added fun facts. The Stadium is in a great area and very well maintained. Our only regret is that we could not see either locker room, but not Mike's fault, Petco Park rules. If you do visit, I hope Mike is your tour guide....",50,Petco Park,September 2019
AJG35,My first San Diego Padres game....great experience,This was a great experience. I found the atmosphere to be top notch. I had a good view of the game. Staff were very friendly and steered me in the right direction. I suppose the only negative are the prices they charge for drinks and food.....they charge like scrub bulls... I know this is not unusual as I have been to a couple of other ballparks in the US. I would recommend to anyone to take in a game when in town.,40,Petco Park,August 2019
jtlerman,Terrific Ball Park,"Underrated ball park.  The sight lines are great here.  Hard to find a bad seat.  Love the unique character of this ball park.  It's not a ""cookie cutter"" stadium.

But, Petco has live bands outside the park before games, lots more food places, great seating, teen activities, and beautiful weather year round. Only neg: Getting to lower boxes by the dugouts from centerfield entrances is awkward.",50,Petco Park,August 2019
RandyVantastic,Descent into the Darkness for the Vertically Challenged,"Within the Cave Store is the entrance to the La Jolla Caves.  Pay $5.00 each and you can descend 145 steps down to a lookout over the Pacific Ocean.  It would be cool to see without the masses going up and down the stairs, so get their early.  A bit of a struggle for many on the way back up the 145 stairs, but the experience is worth it.",40,La Jolla Caves,March 2019

gjanzso,The cave should be free,There is some confusion in the reviews of the cove and the cave. The cave itself is payable and does not worth at all. You just go down hundred something steps to look at a cave output for a minute then climb back. Totally not worth to pay for this entry. If you just walk at the cove around you can see way more for free.,10,La Jolla Caves,April 2019
musictrekker,curious,"I've been going to La Jolla for 25 years.  Always curious as to what the caves looked like.  The best part of the attraction is the small, cramped tunnel that leads to the caves from the Cave Store entrance.  If you're claustrophobic, this isn't for you. Once on the cave floor, it's a bit underwhelming.  Neat to see, but really not that interesting.  Better to see the caves from an ocean kayak.",30,La Jolla Caves,June 2018

marypoppinswannabe,Definitely Worth Your Time,The visitor center has several different movies to view. We watched one of the history and one on tide pools. The view of San Diego can't be beat!

normany157,My Favorite Ballpark,"I live in San Francisco and we have a highly rated ballpark, but I like Petco Park way better than Oracle Park.  I like how wide the concourse is.  Also, the in and out privileges.  All game.  Not just before first pitch.  Now that I’m over 60, the $6 off per ticket is very nice.  I’ve stayed at the Omni across the street and there’s a special walkway for Omni guests.  Taco Tuesday is always fantastic.  $2.50 tacos from numerous vendors in the park.  I could go on and on, but I highly recommend visiting Petco Park for baseball season.  The team is currently struggling, yet they have great young talent.",50,Petco Park,July 2019

gaylerae,Not what I was hoping for,We were looking for a good sandy beach to play at with children and this was not it. We visited here in February and there was actually very little sand area and most was getting covered up with water. Even looked at the lifeguard info boards and it wasn't high tide time so maybe it was the time of year? Just big rocks everywhere and even getting down to the rocks on the made staircases was difficult as some of them are in poor condition. Many people were walking their dogs up on the sidewalk above the beach and this is really all this place seemed good for. I will say the view was beautiful. Waves crashing with the turquoise blue colors was magnificent but just not what I was expecting.,30,Windansea Beach,February 2019
Duquesadiner,Good views of surfers at certain times,"A short distance south of La Jolla Cove you will find Windandsea Beach. It’s name pretty much describes it, this is a surfers paradise when the conditions are right. I don’t see this as being a location that should attract families with children, the water doesn’t really suit easy swimming but if you are when when surfers are out then it is a good place to visit.",30,Windansea Beach,February 2019

nelsoniac,Balboa Park,"If you come to San Diego and skip this you missed out, the architecture alone is a reason to come here. The Spanish buildings are spectacular and the grounds gorgeous. If you hate museums skip it and just go for a stroll at the very least. My favorite place to spend an afternoon in San Diego.",50,Balboa Park,August 2019
AnLily,Not Beautified just Museums Galore,"I was surprisingly disappointed by Balboa Park. Maybe comparing it to smaller Canadian cities’ like Vancouver or large American urban sanctuaries like Central Park, I expected more...lushness. The Spanish-imported palms (all non native except ankle-brushing shrubs) are practically all that could survive in the sandstone substrata. A herbarium or covered botanical “garden” appeared small—more Australian than San Diego. There isn’t much greenery, but we eventually found the Palm Canyon Trails hidden below street level. It’s the only free place on site. A path descends down stairs from the parking/ramp between the outdoor theater beside Japanese garden ($12) and Art Institute, adjacent to the Art Museum. To get there, a model railroad is inside the History Center (with washrooms!), past the Museum of Natural History. The Photography Museum will be by donation only. Basically the majority of the museums seemed to charge admission close to $10, but if you go online and buy a pass then it’s cheaper overall (buy my explorer .org). That won’t include vehicular parking or Zoo services. (Admission to the Zoo and gift shop costs $56 USD.) You’d need to walk too far in walking distance from parking, overlooking the highway, to reach the playground far far away. The Metropolitan Transit System also services the Zoo/ loop, close to the Artists’ Studios inside Balboa Park. There seems to be lots to pass the time, but only if you have lots for leisure and money to spend.",30,Balboa Park,December 2019

tiffanybrasch,Amazing,"We visited at the end of the season, end of April, but there were still plenty of seals there. It was fun to watch them. I could have stayed all day, we stayed for about an hour. The viewing space allows for you to see everything while still respecting the habitat of the seals. Very cool!",50,Children's Pool,April 2019
gregm75460,Great Photo Opportunity,This was such a cool spot to visit.  Seeing the seals in their natural habitat was amazing.  There were several times in which the seals were within a few feet of us.  There is a really cool cave store nearby.  My family enjoyed walking through the tunnel to a sea cave opening.  Only downside was a slightly foul odour in the area.,50,Children's Pool,August 2019

Lambretta101,What an Amazing Spot,Got this place recommended to me by a para glider before starting my trip. So glad I listened. A few miles out of town and your rewarded with some quite spectacular sites. Was so good sitting on the grass watching the flights. If I had more time I’d have paid for a tandem flight. As it is being there was excellent in itself. What an introduction to wonderful San Diego.,50,Torrey Pines Gliderport,July 2019
jonesyclan1234,No Park Zone Today,"Took the beautiful drive out to Torrey Pines.  Beautiful scenery. Parking at the Gliderport was not available due to UCSan Diego students taking all the spots, so we watched a few minutes from our car and left.  The Gliderport does have a good website to inform you of soaring conditions so you don’t waste time going out to see nothing.   ",30,Torrey Pines Gliderport,October 2019
RobinsonAdvisor,Great view. Nice way to relax for a little.,"This is clearly a tourist spot, but it’s not too touristy. There’s a small restaurant with low to average priced food, drinks, snacks. It’s far from fancy, but nice. All that to say that my husband, teenager and I spent 90 minutes there watching patrons take the leap off the cliff and glide over the beach. We went mid-morning on a Thursday. So, it wasn’t crowded. We saw maybe 4-5 flights and then walked around the cliffs to look out into the ocean at surfers. The cliffs are higher than they look at first and you can walk down to the beach if you’re up for a little workout. Wear shoes with good grip and you’ll be fine (rocks are smooth). Plenty of nice views in San Diego. So, don’t force this stop, but if you’re doing other things in the area, it’s worth a stop. ",40,Torrey Pines Gliderport,October 2019

Kary S,Great Experience!,"We had an awesome visit to this sight even though we were not able to see it all because of the government shut down was going on during the time we were there. All of the employees were off so the main park was closed but we were able to view the areas that were open to the public. It was awesome to look across the bay overlooking the city and to see all the military bases around the area.

cheese4me,Excellent Day Trip,"This is my husband and my second visit to the aquarium, we enjoyed ourselves so much the first time (June 2019) we decided to visit again. The grounds are clean and organized. No too crowded.  We visited on a Friday before Veterans Day. The tanks and displays are clean.  You can find all that is posted on the sign in the tanks.  We really enjoyed the Sea Kelp Forrest, the fish are plentiful and some are so large you would not believe that they are not small whales.  The Sea Turtle was enjoyable as well.  He is not always present so it is special when he does appear. It was fascinating to watch the Sea Horses and the Sea Dragon – just beautiful and very magical. The employees are eager to answer questions are they are very knowledgeable. The site has a look out over the ocean with comfortable seating.  We sat for at least a half an hour and enjoyed the fog and the sun and the sounds of the ocean.  Great place for all ages. We were sorry that we didn’t buy the annual pass.  However you can apply the entrance ticket to the cost of the annual pass ($55.00) pp and $19.00 single use day pass for adults. Nice gift shop as well.",50,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,November 2019

The parking lot was full of stuent cars from one of the nearby campus buildings. The parking lot was not paved and dirt settled all over the cars in very little time, which is good to know if you ae planning a visit.  Seeing the gliderport we decided to park. The views were magnificent. Nothing was going on at the gliderport so we decided to walk to the cliff, discouraged when the site is active. It is very rough terrain, but the views were worth it.  We were there around 10 a.m., but no one was around. It is one of those places where we would like to return when more is going on.

I also recommend hiking shoes if you plan to explore and not wear flip flops like i did. ,50,Sunset Cliffs Natural Park,December 2019

NateDawgMama,Nice aquarium but very small.,"This is a nice aquarium however many of the exhibits are really small.  We had older kids, 11 and 15, and it was not as interesting as some other aquariums we have been to.  We thought they would have larger tanks with larger fish, but this aquarium seems to focus more on seahorses.  The seahorse exhibits were really interesting.",30,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,November 2019

Way2013,Great Visit,"Birch Aquarium is a small, but interesting aquarium to visit.  There are some very interesting species of sea life at this aquarium.  Our favorite was the sea dragon sea horse.  It is just one incredible sea horse unlike the sea horses you normally think of.  There are some other interesting species of fish and sea life at the aquarium too.  Well worth visiting.",50,Birch Aquarium at Scripps,November 2019

staffsdogmum,Fantastic tour - even for baseball beginners! ,"We had a great tour of the Petco stadium, I wish I could remember the tour guides name as he did a fantastic job, incredibly knowledgeable. The tour does feel like you get chance to see everything - you don’t get to visit the actual padres dressing room but our guide explained it was because the players use the facility during off season, which made sense. All in all, good value for money and would recommend! ",50,Petco Park,November 2019
Stanton1234,"Billed as the best ball park in the major leagues, and I agree.","This is a must do and see for anyone who loves or doesn't love baseball.

Laura R,The caves are closed.,There has been a major collapse in the cave.   Last I heard the City had closed them.   You can call San Diego Parks and Rec. to check this out.   It is kind of fun to see the cave if you can.  Again parking in La Jolla can be a pain.,10,La Jolla Caves,October 2019

alicemL5229RV,Check the tides!,"We didn't go to the actual monument, but we went down by the tide pools. There is a paved pathway down to the beach, and then it is a short walk to the tide pools, which is very neat to see. Unfortunately, because of the rising/waning tides, depending on when you go, your experience can be very different. We went kind of at the beginning of high tide so we couldn't really get to the big tide pool, but the water washed up enough to get some animals in some of the smaller pockets of water. We saw some fish and little crabs. There's some info before you get down there that shows you what kind of animals you can expect to see, but we didn't see a whole lot. If you do end up going when the tide is higher or rising, expect to get wet. The waves splashing in drenched us when we went a little too far out so maybe bring some extra clothes. It was a different experience for my kids (2 and 5), and they really enjoyed exploring, but if you've seen tide pools before, this probably isn't a really good one. Also expect a bit of a climb to get down there. There are some pretty steep areas that my 5 year old was scared to go on by himself.",50,Cabrillo National Monument,August 2019

I would rate this the #1 sight to see in San Diego.",50,Cabrillo National Monument,November 2019

dfndr90,Lots of stores with a great selection,It does get crowded so I would recommend going early. Be aware the mall exit is the last exit before crossing the border. Traffic actually going across the border backs up beyond the exit so you may get stuck in this traffic. You might look for alternate routes during the busy border crossing times.,50,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,October 2018
Pink P,Meh!,Nothing special.  Pleasant outdoor outlet mall with typical southwest architecture/atmosphere.  But no real bargains.  Prices no cheaper than regular stores and in some cases (perfume stores) the prices were actually higher.  The only reason to visit here is its proximity to the US/Mexico border.,30,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,May 2019
Christopher D,Plenty of bargains!,"I visited here during a one week stay in San Diego. The location isn’t exactly right next to the tram station, however, is within walking distance for those who are relatively fit and can stand the heat. There are a large variety of retailers here including major brands such as Nike, Adidas, Footlocker, Asics, Nautica and others. It’s a great location for having so many outlet stores in one spot and the prices are generally great! There were some food and drink options available though some of these had shut for the day (I did visit on the 2nd January though) or didn’t open at all. Overall a good experience and next time I’m in San Diego I’d happily visit again to snap up some bargains!",40,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,January 2019

Adrian J,"A large and fun outlet mall, very close to the Mexican border","I spent a fun few hours at the San Diego Factory Outlet Center at Plaza Las Americas.  There are a great range of stores, and while not everything was all that cheap, you could find some real bargains by looking at the clearance sections of many stores.  This place is extremely close to the Mexican border and I understand that some of the shop staff cross the border from Mexico to work here.  There were obviously many Mexican visitors on the day I went.  I found it interesting to see a significant number of Mexican-plated cars in the parking lot, and there was a lot of Spanish being spoken.  As well as an impressive range of stores, there is a pleasant food court area.  Visitors should also note that there is a large Ross Dress for Less just across the road from the Outlet Center for further clothing bargains.  To get here by public transport, as I did, take the Blue Line train to Iris Ave, and then catch the 957 bus which stops directly outside the Outlet Center.",50,San Diego Factory Outlet Center,November 2019

Sadly it has toppled over in June of this year. There are benches just to sit and chill and enjoy the ocean. The water was too high to walk on the beach due to a lot of rain the day before. The area also has a lot of small shops and restaurants to make it a fun day. Parking was difficult and we chose to just bite the bullet and pay to park in a parking garage. The stairs in the picture are a short cut down to the beach area. ",50,La Jolla Cove,December 2019
MAP12,Not what I expected.,All my life I have heard about how great the San Diego Zoo is - so maybe I was expecting too much.  It is HUGE and yet many of the animal enclosures are very small - way too small for some of the animals in them.  It broke my heart to see animals pacing in small spaces.   ,30,San Diego Zoo,November 2019

AnLily,Animals in Hiding,"The Zoo is San Diego’s prime attraction, just a short bus ride from the Convention Center. (It’s within jogging distance of hotels such as Omni; I wouldn’t pay the $30 that tour companies charge for transportation.) Visiting in mid spring-early summer is best, when Butterfly Breeding project adds a burst of color. Too bad, the aerial tram and bus tour didn’t allow a good view. To see the Polar Bears, you’ll need to climb the hill from where the bus drops you off. Many of the animals were hidden from sight, although the baby giraffes, meerkats and elephants were cute. The orangutangs were visible; only one tiger was closer to viewers, pacing. Wear good shoes...you’ll wear them out! Admission is $56 USD; and there must be a crime problem, because just to browse the gift shop without wishing zoo-entry, my friend had to pay the full refundable admission price. In order to watch the theatre show as well, the price jumped an additional $6 (for “Plus” 12 years and older). Children 5-11 years only get a $10 discount. I thought the zoo should give a seniors’ deal. It’s worth the $89 two-in-one: Zoo and Safari, which locals will say is a much better experience (although a further drive around 45 miles inland). The caravan trucks allow you to go close and feed the giraffes, or ride the trams overhead as well. You won’t need to use the tickets on consecutive days, so skip day 2 at the zoo to enjoy animals in their ‘natural’ habitat!",30,San Diego Zoo,December 2019

There are restaurants and shops in the area; as well as, a park where the locals gather to do picnics.  Which brings a good atmosphere to the place.  La Jolla Cove is a nice little place where you can admire the views and the seals.  The seals are on the beach and swimming in the ocean so you are really close to them.  Good place for kids to see the Seal in their natural state.  The water temperature was not the best.  It was Early July with a 90 degree Fahrenheit temperature and the water was cold.

N2250QSlisab,Loved the zoo!,We loved the zoo. Recommend doing the tour bus first and then taking the sky-ride thing back to the entrance when done.  Great exhibits. Lots of staff to help guide you. TIP: down load the app because the online map actually works like navigation so you can see if you’re heading on the right direction...sooo much better than a paper map. Hope that helps! ,50,San Diego Zoo,November 2019
m_lawson90,Fab day out!,Thoroughly enjoyed our day at the zoo. So many highlights and going early ensures you see most of the superb animals before they retire to the shade.

Allow yourself a good few hours to see everything. Would love to return some day.,50,San Diego Zoo,October 2019

peterp53,Wonderful Zoo,Wife and I spent the day at the San Diego Zoo and had a great time. It took us the entire day 10:15 - 4:45 and we were able to cover the entire zoo. If you’re someone that likes to read all the plaques of the different animals/exhibits and take your time you will probably not be able to do it in one day. The zoo is very well laid out and all the employees and volunteers were great. ,50,San Diego Zoo,November 2019
zsa318,Fun afternoon getaway,"My wife and I had some hours to kill before her conference began, so we picked to zoo.  The price was a bit steep, but the size and variety was massive.

There are some typical beach shops here as well as some good walk-up restaurants with decent food and some fun bars at night.  During the day, the swimming is great (docile tiger sharks in only 3-4 feet of water right off the beach), surfing is good for beginners with lessons available at a few shops, and kayaking in the caves also fun.

VCBestor,Snorkeling: delicious-looking fish!,I just brought my own cheap-o snorkel and didn't wear a wetsuit in October; I periodically got out to warm up. There were big fish to be seen just a few feet from the beach! I think I mostly saw bass. They were probably large due to the marine sanctuary. I would have loved to catch them with my teeth.

38sallyj,Just amazing,"We were in two minds whether to go to the zoo, as it really was so expensive at $57 each, but we're so glad we went.  The whole day was amazing, from the start when we arrived for the 9.00 opening time, it was fun they give you a little chat, then release the parrots.  We then had the tour round on the bus, this was good as it gave you a feel for the zoo.  We walked round each section, and saw so many beautiful animals. The animals all have a good amount of space to roam about in their enclosures, that was good to see.  The highlight for me was seeing a polar bear for the first time, and we were lucky enough to see it walking about its enclosure.  Also the Koala's were great.  We finished our day withe the cable car ride, which was fun.  I'm so pleased we visited, and i can understand why San Diego Zoo is one of the best Zoo's in the world.",50,San Diego Zoo,October 2019

556donf,Sea Lions Everywhere,"The first thing you notice is the smell, fresh ocean salt with a tinge of earthy animal.  The sea lions interact with the tourist invaders well.  Interact is a bit of a stretch, more of a benign indifference. Great sound effect with frequent territorial battles.  Throw in a few Instagram influences staging a wedding proposal on the rocks, complete with rogue waves to lighten the mood. A perfect sunset completes the experience.",50,La Jolla Cove,October 2019

We took the trolley around the park but were sitting on the lower level.  We were not really able to see much. You want to get upstairs or wait for the next one. That was the only sorta negative!!  I also had a chance to visit with local women who were there with their friends and babies and young children. Many of them go every week and the kids were having so much fun. It was great!!!,50,San Diego Zoo,November 2019

painterly77,Watched the Sunset,"What a beautiful place. It was a hot day but the sea breezes kept us cool.

mrounsfull,Seals are all over! ,"We stopped by La Jolla Cove our first day in the San Diego area. While we didn't go snorkling, quite a few people were out there and the water was very clear. What was really cool was how close you could get to the seals and sea lions. We were sure to pay attention to the signs and keep our distance from them, however not everyone listens and one lady was almost attacked by one because she was trying to touch one. There is definitely a really horrible smell when you walk over there, but the closer you get to the ocean, it goes away. I would love to come back someday to snorkel in the cove.

With your admission, you can ride on the 40-minute tour bus, kangaroo hop on-hop off buses, and the sky tram. That really helped to get from one side of the complex to another.

We started with a tour bus ride around the park to get an overview of the zoo which helped us to figure out how we would plan out the rest of the day. We saw many great exhibits and different animals many that you won’t see at most zoos. We also rode the sky tram and had a great view of no only the zoo but a lot of the north end Balboa Park. It is very well worth the price of admission. The zoo is a must see if you are in San Diego,50,San Diego Zoo,October 2019

Cutes12,"Stinky, but worth it to get close to the Sea Lions!","A charming cove for getting close to amazing Sea Lions, which come right up on the beach to sunbathe, & seem to enjoy posing for photos!  The only problem was the tremendous stench! Not sure if it was from the Sea Lions or the hundreds of birds pooping on the surrounding rocks.  It unfortunately cut our visit short, as the smell was so bad that we opted to take our picnic elsewhere.  it was a very hot day, so perhaps on a cooler day the smell would not be so off-putting.  Parking is hard to find if you're not staying at a local hotel.  Be very careful if you decide to go down into the La Jolla Caves, as the rocks are super slippery!  It was worth the trip for the great photos we took of the charming Sea Lions!",40,La Jolla Cove,September 2019

BRDchelseafans,The gold standard of zoos,"San Diego Zoo is just the best; it is large, well laid out, great map, and excellent docents all over the place. A knowledgable docent explained that the elephants in the zoo were elderly and lovingly cared for,  to avoid trauma to the animals.There is a lot of walking involved,but you can take the bus tour to get an overview, or use the hop on/off bus (The Kangaroo bus) to get around the zoo. We also rode the Skyfari ride to get from the far point of the park back to the front. You can bring in picnic lunches and drinks, but there are plenty of places to eat. Parking is free! Located in beautiful Balboa Park.",50,San Diego Zoo,October 2019
Lynn W,Great zoo. Lots of animals!,"There is lots to see at this zoo so give yourself lots of time. They have setup the area with seats, benches, washrooms and drinks for purchase about every 10-15 minutes of walking which makes it a pleasant experience. It is difficult to figure out where you are in the zoo so plan out your route and don't be afraid to ask for directions. Starting with taking the air tram to the farthest end then walking back from there is a good start.  The elephant habitat was the largest and best one I had ever seen. The animals are very well taken care off. Try to take in feeding time when possible for any of the animals and the staff are on hand to answer questions. Oh - be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes!",50,San Diego Zoo,October 2019

310johny,Sea problem creates danger,"I visit this area every year, unfortunately the sea lion over population has, made it impossible to enjoy the area. Between the profuse smell and the over population of sea lions, there waste is clearly visible and the smell permeates absolutely everything. Life guards refuse to work the five because of the high bacterial count caused by Sea Lion Fecal matter.

They truly  care about their animals. The park and the Animal enclosures were very clean also. Very nice zoo!!!,50,San Diego Zoo,October 2019
GauravBansal27,Decent zoo but cost is too high,It's a good place with kids however nothing so great if you are grown up and looking for interesting  animals. Park itself is quite big and transportation is included in ticket cost.,30,San Diego Zoo,October 2019
kmtom,Lots of animals to be seen and helpful staff!,My only complaint is with the TripAdvisor system - I wasn't able to access my ticket after the date I entered (even though it said it was available for 1 year from when I purchased it). Thankfully I took a screenshot and was able to use the ticket from that.,50,San Diego Zoo,August 2019
thewesterntrek,"Zip-a-dee-ZOO-dah, what a wonderful day","The Animals in Action experience is amazing. Every day is different, but we got to see a macaw, a porcupine, feed a rhino and flamingos,  and see a clouded leopard and a cheetah. The staff was knowledgeable and all about safety - for the animals and the guests. If walking isn’t for you, they have a sky rail and also a bus tour. ",40,San Diego Zoo,October 2019
Mosby2,Day at the Zoo,"Beautiful weather, took the bus tour around the zoo before doing the walking around to choice spots.  Extremely clean zoo without a lot of the expected smells.  Plenty of shops and food/drink spots, along with well marked restrooms.  Our group thoroughly enjoyed our day at the zoo.",50,San Diego Zoo,October 2019
