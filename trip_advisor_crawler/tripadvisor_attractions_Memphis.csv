"This is not to rate the distillery, the rating I am giving is for service. As a business owner myself when I post hours of operation those are the hours you operate. We drove 2 1/2 hours to Memphis to go to Beale street have lunch and then go to the distillery. We knew the last tour was at 5pm and we were there at 4:20 to purchase tickets for the tour. We were told the 5 pm tour has booked for a private group. Again as a business owner you don’t book private tours during regular business hours. I see this as poor business and we won’t be back!!",July 2019,Old Dominick Distillery,Poor business ,twitch2661,10

"We loved doing the tour of Old  Dominick's distillery. I am happy to be the proud owner of a bottle of the ""Memphis toddy"". A great story. This is the most western of the distilleries on the ""whiskey trail"". We got our booklet to get more stamps. And when you are slightly hammered after the tasting, you go next door  to their restaurant, (open after 4) or across the street to Gus' fried chicken. A perfect little outing.",May 2019,Old Dominick Distillery,Really worth the trip!,karbety,40

"Our tour guide Kate was fabulous, informative, and spunky. Dominick is a very nice place with an interesting back story. Well stocked gift shop but on the expensive side. Tour took about 40 minutes and there are samples at the end. Very nice rooftop bar, can’t wait to go back at night. Memphis Toddy was our favorite and we took a bottle home.

"We took our 5 year old granddaughter to the Children's Museum - and she had a blast.  The hands on exhibits are terrific learning tools - and there is even an outside play area.

"While waiting outside of Gus‘s famous fried chicken old Dominick’s distillery is across the street so we stopped in to look around and maybe a quick drink. Rehab old machine building down to the bricks to create a chic modern distillery, Definitely fits in a neighborhood of revitalization of downtown Memphis, tried the bourbon but it had too much bite for me but I know some bourbon drinkers like that, so if you’re in Memphis looking for some time to kill  why not stop by and take a look, and try some of the bourbon, gin and, spirits they make,",September 2018,Old Dominick Distillery,OK bourbon,Explore650498,30

There was a lot of things to do.  The FedEx airplane was fascinating for both young and old. There was outside slash park and park. The kids really enjoyed it enough to back a few days later.

The church is in a road off Elvis Presley blvd but you need a car or transport to get there.  Tourists outnumbered the local congregation but it was not crowded.  The service is long but you can leave when you like.  Bishop A.L. Green always arrives late.  The service starts at 11.30 on a Sunday morning.  He arrived at 12 but the service does start around 11.30.  There is singing and responses from the congregation and preaching all at top volume.  A good use if a Sunday morning.,October 2015,Full Gospel Tabernacle,Good Sunday morning,jillhoy,40
"This is a strange conglomeration of artifacts (off the beaten path), which comes primarily from the Asian influence, offers a horrific display of ivory carvings, a modest collection of jade decorations, and a simple gathering of Judaica items including a small holocaust collection. The irony of juxtaposing an ivory display (that essentially represents the elimination of an entire species of animals) with a modest holocaust memorial and calling it art can not be lost on the viewer. Clearly not worth the time - which is probably why no one else was in the museum the day I stopped in, and the singular attendant was lost in a book he was reading.",January 2017,Belz Museum of Asian & Judaic Art,Unfortunate and Bizarre,JanetJulia,20
"I accompanied my wife with her jewelry making class from UL.  They were volunteers at Repair Days 2017.  It was a great event!  I am more into old machinery and machine work but techniques used are for the most part the same.  I particularly enjoyed the tinning and iron pouring.  There is a foundry and blacksmith shop which are very well organized.  Not to be missed of course is the museum itself which houses an extensive collection of metalwork.

"Ok.. i got to admit, i am normally not visiting any church. But as the trip to Memphis was meant for my parents i made an exception. My dad really wanted to see a gospel choir and because we were visiting Graceland it was the next thing to do. The church is only 10 minutes away from Graceland and of course it is famous for All Green being the pastor there. We were there earlie, when there was still Sunday school. We were invited to come back later, service started at 11:30. If you are considering visiting here, than even 11:30 is still earlie and it won't be a problem to arrive later than that. The locals do to, they drop in at just any time. Fully dressed up, even the small children. Th gospel choir is amazing, you cant sit still. Mr All Green was there and the service was friendly, loving, funny and respect full to every one. People are singing, dancing and emotionally very involved. It was something i had never experienced before and it was worth every minute!  If we had more churches like this in the world, i believe people would be more at ease with one another and this world would become a better place.",September 2014,Full Gospel Tabernacle,Angels voices,Yvon D,50

"Someone took an awesome (pink) historic building and turned it into a wedding venue while building a horrible modern attachment to it and called it by the same name.

"Been going here for years, but lately the place has gone down to the dogs. It's gotten to be a huge Chuck E. Cheeses - except Chuck has better food. The place is always dirty now and some noisy construction is always a sure bet.

"This was truly a memorable experience for our group of 13 travelling friends (both children and adults).  All of us were truly inspired and felt at ease joining in with the congregation in celebrating, singing and praising God.  We felt blessed in being able to have experienced the sermon by Rev Al Green and the choir and band were truly amazing.  They recommend a $2.00 tithe each and this didn't bother us at all.  Warning though, it is not the 1 hour church regulated service you get in Australian churches - it is quite sporadic and inspiring.  Rev Green burst into song and varying praises at any given time.

"This gorgeous house faced with Georgian pink marble was built by the fellow who invented the idea of 'pick your own groceries' stores. It is now an interesting museum.  A highlight for me was the three-wall panel mural painted by Burton Callicott, a well-known local artist, under the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the largest and most ambitious American New Deal agency.

There were two interesting exhibits when we were there.  One was a jewelry artist and the other was an anti-gun sculptor.  Both were great.  The permanent collection is fairly small.  There was no one working in the shop so we didn't get to see any demos other than those on the videos.

I was reluctant to go to this attraction but I would have missed a true beauty.  We spent about one hour in viewing the amazing collection of Chinese art.  Huge pieces of sculpted jade and ivory are overwhelming.  Large pieces of bronze are also quite impressive.  If you like cloisonné and cinnabar they have plenty of that too.  This is a very impressive collection.  We got a Groupon that covered admission and gave us a $10 credit for the gift shop (we have 3 little buddas to take home).  We did not see any other visitors during our stay and the gift shop worker said that they have about 10 per day during the week but more on the weekends.  I would not miss this place if you are interested in Chinese art.  The Judaic section was much less impressive but it did have a nice tribute to holocaust survivors who made their homes in Memphis after the war.  I was surprised how many survivors lived in this city.,May 2016,Belz Museum of Asian & Judaic Art,Diamond in the rough,Robert R,50

We love visiting the CMOM and do often. There are so many things to do and see here but unfortunately so many of them need updates or aren't in great running order (the fishing area). I do love the play area inside for young children. My kids love it there (4yo & 2yo) and I love it because there is a door that closes so I know they're safe. The outside play area is also fun - more geared toward older kids.,June 2016,The Children's Museum of Memphis,"Good, could be great.",aduggan520,40
My 7 year old loved the Skyscraper crawl through thingy.  My 14 year old loved flying the computerized airplane.  And it was a toss up for my 3 and 5 year olds between the air ducts with scarves and large Pom poms speeding through them or the fishing area on the Mississippi.  A good time and must visit.

There were some exhibits that were a bit dated and some that seemed brand new.  There was good variety and a little bit for all ages.

"I thought this museum was great. If it's hot outside this is the place to go. The museum alone is $12, if you want to go outside and do the splash pad and outdoor play area it's $20. It's a bit pricey, when you do the outside area, since you have to pay for adults to, even if you aren't getting in the splash pad. Nothing museum itself was wonderful, definitely worth the $12. There are s ton of activities for the little ones, you could easily spend 2 to 3 hours just in the museum alone. I really think it's geared probably ages 3 to 11. This is definitely a must see if you have littles . They have several different areas of activities, they even have a four and under.

At the time of this review we went to see Extreme Weather in 3D, Winter Star gazing in the planetarium, and walked the museum.  Extreme Weather was a long global warming commercial and that is ok if you are expecting it, but I was wanting a National Geographic type Weather experience not a propaganda film, which is what it felt like.

"this is a super cool place .  just a small old cemetery with city fathers  big wigs from back in the day and some notables including Robert Church, a fascinating figure who used to practically rule Beale Street and was an amazing survivor and entrepreneur.  Anyway sort of isolated off the beaten path a few blocks from downtown beside some old railway tracks over a moat and accessible by a bridge just wide enough for a horse drawn hearse it seems.  You can imagine back in the day this was on the edge of town. It's a great place to wander and wallow in the past with many romantic and slightly crumbling gravestones, all very cool.  They seem to take wonderful care of it which is uplifting to see, you hear bugs buzzing and the train going by and you really feel like you are in the deep south.  Even a large area just filled with hundreds of yellow fever victims, so crazy, what a wonderful (if you can say that about a cemetery) experience.  I even recommend just sitting in a rocking chair they generously leave on the front porch of the gingerbread office house.

The Asian collection is large in size and scope. Very accessible and easy to navigate. We were amazed by the virtuosity  and complexity of the artistry and it is a don't miss experience.

"I had read the reviews but knew my husband and 2 sons had no interest in going - so this was probably a stop I was going to miss.  However, when my husband laid down with me and the 4 year old to take a nap on our last day in Memphis (this is usually a mommy job so that daddy can go get some quiet time), I took the opportunity to let him sleep at the hotel and I high tailed it to the museum -- boy am I glad I did. Let me start by saying while I love art, I have zero interest in Asian art, but this exhibit took my breath away - I was physically moved by the collection.  I think this resulted from the absolutely amazing caliber of artwork from amazing artisans (a level of Asian artistry I have never seen in a museum -- but then I usually skip this section of the museum), the fact that this is a private collection & I still can't fathom how one family can own this caliber of art, and also while an amazing collection it is pretty easy to take in.  I left with a new appreciation for the quality of craftsmanship that has come from Asia.  I then took a brief walk though the Judaic section -- I also have zero interest in religious art, but I did observe that I have never seen Judaic art in the dozens of galleries I had been in, only Christian art -- which says a lot I suppose.  I then wondered into the room with the stories from Holocaust survivors from Memphis and was moved in a much more emotional way reading there stories.

Here there is colour and brilliantly detailed carvings mostly in ivory which would not, and should not happen today. This is a welcome place away from music for a while and a place just to be quiet and reflect and indeed enjoy.",October 2016,Belz Museum of Asian & Judaic Art,A Strange Mix That Works,362graemes,40
"This is an amazing place to visit. The price of admission is extremely reasonable. The gallery is located right on the trolley line on Main Street. It opened in 1998. There are three permanent exhibit galleries in all: 3 Asian, 1 Judaic and the Holocaust Memorial gallery. There are over 1400 objects on display. The jade and ivory art is unbelievably exquisite. Some of the work dates back to the fifteenth century. The art in the Judaic gallery is more current for the most part. Some of the paintings are beautifully colorful. The Holocaust Memorial gallery is small but very moving. There is some art work there but also you will find stories of Holocaust survivors.

This collection had an amazing amount of fantastic Chinese art.  There is a huge amount of 3D carvings in ivory and jade.   They have mammoth tusks carved with very detailed images.    The cost for seniors was $5 each.  $6 adults.   Well worth the cost.     Also found the other art including Judaic very interesting.   Various art objects and artifacts.

"Went to the Pink Palace this past Tuesday with the family. I went as a kid and this will be the 2nd time we've been with my family. Love the wax figures and the early settler exhibits. Enjoyed the new interactive dinosaur exhibits. Some of the exhibits have ""press button and listen"" options but only found 1 or 2 that actually worked. The Ringling brothers circus attraction & the part of the attraction that attaches to the mansion were both under maintenance. Almost wish that they would close the place and finish repairing and maintaining so that when they are open a person could get the full show. Pretty disappointing that we were unable to see it all.",May 2017,Pink Palace Museum,1ST SUMMER ACTIVITY W/ THE KIDS,jennfrugalrox,30
"I was anxious to see the renovated planetarium, so I visited the museum and planetarium with an 11 year old. If you are visiting Memphis for the first time, I would say there are other things to do first. Local Memphis should definitely try to find the time for at least one visit. As a natural history museum, there don't appear to be many authentic exhibits except in areas that deal with the history of Memphis. The mansion itself is undergoing renovation and not part of the museum tour. It is a venue for weddings. I find it hard to go higher than average as a rating for the museum. That said, it can be informative and fun - especially for school aged children. The interactive dinosaur exhibit seemed to be the favorite for my young nephew. There are really three parts to the museum and admission is based on what you want to see. There is the museum itself, the planetarium, and an imax theater. The planetarium and theater are additions to the admission price. Generally there are several shows available. Currently there is a nice presentation on the spring skies in the planetarium and a Jean Michael Cousteau (Jaques' son) underwater show in the max.",June 2017,Pink Palace Museum,Difficult Review _ Depends on what you are looking for,bxdiver65,30

There are a number of induction boards listing various people but they don't go back a very long way and there didn't seem to be any explanation of how it started and how you get selected - that would have been good to know.

When we were leaving we were both given a Pecan pie which was absolutely delicious! Although other reviewers have said not to worry about arriving at any time in particular,I think as it's not just a tourist attraction and is actually a real church  I think it's more respectful to arrive on time as it creates a distraction otherwise!

Al Green never preached and never open his Bible. He only quoted things out the Bible for his advancement. I believe the only reason the church is functioning is because tripadvisor promote the church as a hot spot to visit and because Al Green is the pastor. The music is great. He has invested into the music department but I truly believe the church is a scam. He promotes the church as if he is God. His pictures are everywhere, it feel as he is the idiot of the church. Everybody should praise him because he is Al Green. I never have left church mad and upset until I went to this church. I left shamed because I felt like I helped this church disrespect God.

We chalked what we paid up as basically a donation to the Blues Foundation, which is fine. But people thinking of visiting on a trip to Memphis should know that there's not much to see.

"I scheduled a spring photo shoot and did not realize the flower shower was taking place.  The flowers were beautiful but I wish there were more to of them to see.  Before and after the photo shoot, I took a tour.  I purchased a couple items for sale in the pavilion.  It was nice to also find out there was free admission for the flower shower.  I had to park a short distance away and walk along a gravel path to get to the gallery/gardens.  Most guests were nice and others looked at us as if wondering why we were there.  The photographer and I left our belongings on benches throughout the site and no one bothered our things.  Beautiful grounds which made for beautiful photos.  When leaving I turned in the wrong direction twice and the female security/traffic guard screamed at me for doing so.  I would not have turned the wrong way if she was not busy talking to a manager (lady with a walkie talkie who helped direct traffic) I assumed.

When I asked him how long the walking tour generally lasted, he told us he didn't know because he'd never taken it, but it didn't matter because everyone manages to get lost every time anyway.

We thought we were missing something, confused, even. When we finally gave up, we returned the iPods. When we arrived, he asked us is the mp3 players played okay or if any numbers were skipped. An odd question, right? It turns out that he knew that the mp3s were faulty, but chose not to inform us and let us go out on the walking tour anyway.

"This is a real church, not a tourist attraction. And the building itself is not an attraction like the big churches in Europe. So I find it kind of odd even reviewing this place. It would be like reviewing any church in any town in America...with the exception that Al Green is the bishop here. We went on Easter Sunday...we were surprised that Rev. Green was not there. So, if you're going here to see Al Green, you should adjust your expectations. Instead, expect a friendly welcoming congregation. Trust me, you will feel welcome,and you won't feel out of place as a ""tourist"" or ""visitor."" I actually found this place quite humble. For a man as famous as Al Green, he could have parlayed that fame into some kind of modern monstrous megachurch that are all the rage these days. Instead, the service had the feel of a small town church. Kids coming up on stage, forgetting their lines for the skit they're in...stuff like that. Which is nice and refreshing, instead of this ungodly obsession with ""performance"" and slick production you see in many modern churches. (The service started at 11:30 and latest about an hour and a half, rather than three that some people have been saying). That being said, the one area this place really shines and exudes professionalism is in the music, which is probably why you're visiting this place in the first place. Outstanding gospel singing, even without Al Green there. I recommend visiting this church, though, as I said, I feel weird about reviewing in on trip advisor. Keep in mind, this is a real church - this is not Graceland.",April 2016,Full Gospel Tabernacle,I'm not sure I even want to review this place,northropfrye,50
"this church is a tourist attraction for those interested in seeing Al Green. The church had more tourist /visitors than local parishioners. If you are looking for a good word from the lord and a well prepared sermon, go elsewhere. Even the singing left a lot to be desired which was really surprising considering Al Green is the pastor/ bishop.  Bishop green was present the Sunday I visited.  He can still sing and that was the highlight of this experience. Will not be back and do not recommend for those seeking a thought out sermon.",April 2016,Full Gospel Tabernacle,Tourist attraction,Straighttalkros,10

Went to Memphis in May concert. Went to church at  Full Gospel Tabernacle with revered Al Green I was raised a Pentecostal so it was getting back to my roots.  The music was great and the preaching was great. If you go to one place in Memphis this is it. It is free but they do take up a good will offering. Do not be cheap it cost a lot to keep place going. Also do not disrespect the regular members by showing up in shorts and flip flops this is a church. Next time I go to Memphis will go back When Revered Al Green told everyone he loved them you know he actually means it. ,May 2016,Full Gospel Tabernacle,If you go to Memphis this is a must see,Bill S,50
We arrived late but we really wanted to see your museum. We are regular patrons of the arts. We consider our admission fee a donation and a necessary contribution to keep the arts alive. You have a great collection of beautiful metal arts. Half of your staff is nice and the other half is rude. Usually artists are mellow and happy to bend when they see people enjoying the space. Not you. Shame shame. That’s not how you become great! ,March 2018,Metal Museum,Rude Staff,mabeyta,30

The Metal Museum is a very special place on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River in Memphis. From the moment you enter the hand forged gates you will be amazed at the intricate and beautiful metal work done by people love doing this.

A stroll around the grounds and into the shop is a great way to spend a leisurely afternoon and you may find a piece you want to take home with you.,May 2017,Metal Museum,Very Unique Museum,Yvonne109E,50
"This Metal Museum is fantastically different.  The grounds are right on the Mississippi River and the first thing you will notice is the giant, mature trees.  It is breath taking.  The museum itself is a collection of metal works from very abstract and open to interpretation all the way to finely detailed ""garden doors"".  We went during an open house/festival where there were metal craftspeople there making repairs to items people brought in.  The workshop was wide open with activity and it was awesome to sit and just watch the artisans at work.  Take your time, this is not a rush job.  Enjoy the different pieces and be sure to look all over the grounds because you will find surprise metal sculptures all over the place.",May 2017,Metal Museum,a different subject matter for a museum,Kelley D,40

Was here for the 2017 Beale Street Music Fest.  Of course the stage with all the bands I wanted to see was at the opposite end of the main entrance.  If better information was provided I could have saved a lot of leg work by choosing the other entrance.  Staff was only stopping attendees with open cups from bringing them in and not checking or stopping anything else including over sized back packs.  This is supposed to be a venue that allows blankets on the lawn since there is no way you could sit otherwise and enjoy the shows.  The blanket area was even to the side of the stage but that did not stop the selfish and drunken lunatics from walking all over those that needed to sit.  There was no staff around trying to prevent this and the few staff that I did see was just standing around in a daze.  When one did stand up you were pummeled with people wearing backpacks swinging around not caring who they hit with them.  These backpacks are not even supposed to be allowed but here they were.  I was extremely disappointed with how this event was handled and I will definitely not return for any future stagings.  This place is dangerous and unless you can stand for at least six hours I would not recommend it.,May 2017,Tom Lee Park,Trampled at Beale Street Music Fest,MTravi,20

It was an honor to see Bishop Green give his service. One of the most unique religious experiences I have seen. The service starts at 11.30 on Sunday and lasts 2 hrs.,March 2017,Full Gospel Tabernacle,Unique,ScottM130,50
"It does seem weird reviewing a church/service, but I guess it is a bit of a tourist attraction.  We had difficulty finding the exact start time of the service.  Many different sites and reviews had different times.  We went with the time mentioned the most, (11:30am), which happened to be correct.  The church is ""past"" Graceland and very close to it, but it would be difficult to find without a GPS.  The church was smaller than what I envisioned Rev. Green's church should be like, but the ushers were welcoming and we were greeted warmly.  I saw a few ppl from the previous day on Beale St. and maybe a fourth of the attendees, like us, were tourists.  From previous posts/reviews, I was really worried that maybe the Rev. wouldn't be there this particular Sunday, but fortunately, he was.  It was as much a soul gospel concert as it was a sermon and I am glad to say that the Rev. still has that amazing voice that is so distinctive and effortless and it brought goosebumps several times.  The backing praise band and choir were all amazing musicians and overall the music was outstanding; however, I do have one slight criticism.  The bass was too overpowering.  It was loud and it would have been much more enjoyable--and the other instruments and voices would have been much more present-- if the bass turned down.  I play in a band, and I thought it was too loud.  That said, the overall experience was one that I will cherish forever.  It was uplifting and besides being one of the best singers out there, Rev. Green delivered a very good sermon on the unforgiving servant.  The service lasted from 11:30 to 1:30p.  ",March 2017,Full Gospel Tabernacle,Highlight of our visit!,Sean S,50

"Old man Dominik who came to Memphis in the 1840s from Italy to work with his relatives in the grocery and fresh produce trade. He observed that the water in the town was filtered through limestone and of such good quality that he could make whiskey. He kind of did that, but he called it a toddy because he also bought and used the fruit from his relative’s fruit and vegetable stall that hadn’t sold. Medicinal alcohol was commonly prescribed in the late 19th century.  Today his descendants are still making the toddy and also beer, gin and vodka. The tour of the distillery isn’t remarkable – unless you have never done one like it before. People come for the samples and the tasting at the end. There were seven samples taken sitting at the bar; two each of vodka, gin and whiskey and then the toddy as a final shot. All very interesting and it doesn’t take long. Good tour and good merchandise available too.",May 2019,Old Dominick Distillery,People come for the samples,JohnSB3,40
I highly recommend this as a stop in Memphis! We had a memorable experience at Old Dominick for our bachelor party group. Our tour guide was fantastic and very knowledgeable. Everyone in our group commented how great of a job our tour guide did. The bachelor loved learning about Tennessee whiskey and the differences in the process from Kentucky bourbon. And the tasting portion of the experience was the best part. We were amazed at how many samples we were provided to taste and how interactive it was. And the Toddy is so unique and something we are all taking back home with us. Thank you for the hospitality and memories at such a great value.,May 2019,Old Dominick Distillery,"Great tour, great hospitality",TheWallofJerico,50

"The Cotton Exchange is centrally located in downtown Memphis.  It is a short walk  from major hotels and other music-related attractions on Beale Street.  A visit to The Cotton Exchange is a walk back into the social, economic and mercantile history of this vital commodity and its long-lasting impact on a wide portion of the United States.  The Exchange has many static displays, but it also houses many inter-active displays featuring oral histories and video demonstrations of how the industry has changed over the last 150 years and gives a good perspective on how it all worked.  The Cotton Exchange Museum is divided into two sides: the larger side is located in the actual former Exchange facility and is devoted to the larger displays, dioramas, and the inter-active audio and video displays.  The smaller portion of the Museum is located across the hallway and is geared to younger visitors and educational displays. The cost for Seniors is $9.00 per person.

"We have never seen anything like Mud Island.  Getting there is easy… you can take an elevator or stairs/escalator up to the top of the tower where you can choose to walk the bridge across the river or take the monorail (which only runs during special events).  The view is quite something.  When you get to the other side, take a moment and enjoy the view from the end of the bridge at the viewing platform.  After you proceed back downstairs, you will marvel at the level of detail in this scale model of the entire Mississippi River.  Even as a scale model, walking the entire length is surprisingly long.  Part of what we enjoyed the most is that you are welcome to actually walk along, or in, the model in order to get a better feel for the project.  It is full of uneven, slippery surfaces, so you do need to be careful where you place your feet, but it is tons of fun feeling like Gulliver.  Although everything was closed while were were there, we saw a gift shop, coffee shop and museum.  Instead of returning as we came, we continued out the island to the north, because it is not actually an island at all, but connects to the mainland via N Mud Island Rd.  Along that route, we found a beautiful park, the length of the river, filled with playgrounds, grass for picnicking and trails for walking or biking.

They have a handicapped ramp leading to the back door but the day we were there, the guide did not have the key to open up the back door, so my wife, who walks with a cane, had to climb the stairs. Call me silly but if you are going to the trouble and expensive of building a ramp for handicapped people, get a key for the back door. Also, they do not accept credit cards.

DO take the time to read each brick about the sanitation workers strike.  Such an important part of our history.  This place was AMAZING and so well done.  The Plaza actually has a dedication to Abe Plough.  I had NO IDEA who he was until I went here.  Abe made an anonymous donation and funded the raises of all the sanitation workers in the city to end the strike.  It wasn't revealed until after his death of this donation.  Wow.  He deserves a special place in heaven for his generosity and kindness.  A definitely must see.

"Hidden at the end of the touristy end of Beale Street, the W.C. Handy Memphis Home and Museum, tells the story of W.C. Handy- the Father of the Blues. I was the first visitor of the day, getting there right as the lone attendant/ tour guide opened the door. He actually seemed a little surprised I was there, saying that other than tourists from Europe and Asia, and the occasional school group, few people (and especially not locals) came to visit. Quite sad because it sets a beautiful tone for enjoying and seeing everything else on Beale Street and the general music history of Memphis, and it only costs $4 to see. No pictures are allowed inside, but there isn't really much to take pictures of anyway it's only two rooms big. The first is set up with some period pieces and a few artifacts that actually belonged to him, and the second has pictures and sheet music covers framed in (cheap) frames, and a table with merchandise for sale. There's a bathroom and I'm assuming an office or closet that I was told was added on later. While not thoroughly impressed with the presentation (I understand that money is tight for places like this, but I think a fixtures upgrade and thorough dusting is very much so doable) I loved the story of this place and the important life and history it preserves.",July 2012,W.C.

"I so wanted to visit Mud Island River Park and come back and do a glowing review, alas, that is not to be. The park itself has much to offer in the way of a tram and/or footbridge to take you from the mainland to Mud Island free of charge, a museum dedicated to the Mississippi River, a replica of the Mississippi River and all of the states that it touches, an amphitheater, kayaking etc... The problem is that when I visited in mid-September, the tram to Mud Island was out-of-commission (and had been for a while), the museum was closed, and the main event that I planned for on my visit, The Vibe on The Island, (happens once a month) was switched to a different night.

"After a weekend in the Nashville area visiting distilleries on the Tennessee Whiskey Trail, my sister and I decided to do one last tour on our way back to Arkansas. What a wonderful experience we had at Old Dominick Distillery. Our guide, Rachel, was absolutely fabulous, and we could not believe it when she said our tour was only the seventh one she had done. She was a pro!! There was no distilling or filling going on the day we were there so it was rather quiet in the bottling room. But Rachel explained each process thoroughly. The best part was the tasting at the end. When we got to the tasting bar, each place was set up with a flight of samples and a glass of the Memphis Toddy. Rachel taught us how to smell and taste each sample. She saved the best for last, The Memphis Toddy, which is their signature spirit. And that story is told at the beginning of the tour. So you don't want to miss this great distillery in Memphis! Definitely our favorite out of the 6 we visited this weekend. The tour was $12 with the 6 samples, and very well worth the cost!

I found this little Jewel not very far from my hotel. I walked in not expecting as much Beauty and lovely pieces as I actually saw. I took the audio guided tour which helped me immensely. Other people said that they would have liked to have seen dates on some of the pieces but if you looked there were some dates and the audio helped with some of the dates also you kind of have to know the dynasties. The pieces were Beyond description. The  Artistry of some of the ivory carvings was so precise and so delicate that I hardly could believe it was real. I went through the Chinese section piece-by-piece and was impressed with the knowledge in the small plaques. I then went into the Judaic section. Even though most of the pieces are modern sculptures from Israel as well as some paintings. I found them very impressive and moving. I have not seen very many Jewish artists and I was gratified with the amount of friezes. The portrait that moved me most was of the Comfort girls. I was so moved. I was crying. The Holocaust Museum was small but there were a couple of wonderful paintings in there as well as some individual stories of Holocaust Survivors. I was moved by the exhibit. Overall it was very extensive for the small price to get in. As well as having the audio which helped me understand some of the pieces. The audio was only $3. Add that to the price of five.

"I am giving the park a thumbs down due to the BBQ contest held at the venue. Memphis in May is not for visitors. I am sure it is a great event for the competitors and the VIP ticket holders willing to spend the $500+ to get an all access wristband. We were neither of those. We drove 9 hours to Memphis to “experience “ this great BBQ event only to walk around for 4 hours, get way over heated, and have very very little bbq to sample. The hundreds of competitors set up elaborate grilling camps and literally gate off their areas to keep the general public out. I get it- they are there to seriously compete. Unless you know one of them you won’t get any interaction or samples from those cooks. There is a lame line up of state fair food vendors with corn dogs, funnel cakes, popsicle, and tacos. You can also buy $16 tickets for 5 samples at bbq alley. This food was good, but very limited. Serving starts at 2 p.m. and tickets for the alley sell out as do the samples. So unless you rush right in at 2 and get as many as you can you will miss out on that as well. Couple more things- there is very very little seating available to the general public and virtually no bathrooms. It is a hot, unfriendly, downright hostile environment where it is very clear you need to be a bbq celebrity or VIP to be welcomed. We were disappointed to put it mildly.",May 2019,Tom Lee Park,Incredibly disappointed in the bbq contest- would not recommend,Missy P,10

"This is a beautiful historic cemetery that was both interesting and lovely. The grounds are beautiful and we enjoyed walking through it. You can take a self guided tour, or group tour.

We normally spend one or two hundred dollars at historical places in their gift stores to support them because we know funds are important and we enjoy the books and souvenirs, but we decided to buy nothing here because she was just so unpleasant, it really dampened the visit for us.

"If you happen upon Chickasaw Heritage Park (formerly DeSoto Park) you might not think much about it.  However, it is literally full of history dating back hundreds of years.  Located off exit 12 C on the I55 approach to the bridge going to West Memphis, Ark it is directly across from the National Ornamental Metal Museum.  Comprising some 17 acres it is located in what is known as the French Fort Community.  It contains Native American earth mounds, historical markers, walking paths, a sculpture and GREAT views of the Mississippi river ESPECIALLY from the top of the mounds.  It has been home to where legend has it Hernando DeSoto first saw the Mississippi River (there are several areas up and down the Miss River that lay claim to this concept), Spanish settlers, Fort Pickering and a settlement for former slaves.  It is the area where Meriweather Lewis of Lewis & Clark made a stop on his way to Washington to settle debts owed him for the Lewis & Clark expedition of the Louisiana Purchase.  The two ceremonial mounds on site are interesting themselves.  During the Civil War, the mounds were hollowed out and used for gun emplacements and munitions storage.  If you crawl/walk to the top of the one closest to the road you will find the top has been carved out and looks like a giant empty swimming pool and the view from up there of the Mississippi River is awesome.  If you are a history buff it is well worth the time and effort to discover and explore.",September 2014,Chickasaw Heritage Park,History Galore,stumpy6896,40

"If I was rating just on enthusiasm I'd give 5 stars, but they only just opened so as yet they don't have a lot of exhibits.  My son and I are rail fans, so we had to stop here and check it out.  They have a good spot in the train station and have some ambition to add new features as time goes on.  For now, they have some model trains and other things, and a large scale model of a steam train (it actually is a functioning miniature steam locomotive.  My son was allowed to sit on this, and he could control the model Thomas train.  That is fairly rare for museums like this, most of the time they just run the trains and you watch.  They had a nice signal display that you could also control along with historical items.  Their space includes a long tunnel under the station for future exhibits which they were nice enough to show us.  I think if they get an interesting centerpiece exhibit it would go a long way to complete the experience, but for now my family and I did find value in stopping in, especially if you have interest in trains.

The large choir and supporting musicians were able to make the pews vibrate on occasion. Make a joyful noise indeed. The relatively new (Jan, 2013) pastor delivered a spot on message.

"The Mallory-Neely House is really an excellent tour, and I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in Victorian Gothic style and architecture--go, go go!  Virtually everything in the house is original to the owners of the home which makes it unique from most houses of its kind.  Also, our tour guide was incredibly personable and knowledgeable which added a lot to the experience.  The Woodruff-Fontaine House has a lot of really incredible, well-preserved old clothing in it, so if you like to see Victorian clothing it would be worth the trip, and there is a nice piece of stained glass on the stairs, but almost nothing in the house is original to the home, so it's really not all that impressive compared to the other home.  Also, I was quite offended by the tour guide.  She was having a conversation with the others in our group during the tour about the statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest being moved because of his relationship to the Ku Klux Klan (he founded it) and she was talking about how outrageous that was and said ""They should do the same thing to the statue of Martin Luther King.""  Then there was a conversation about how the Ku Klux Klan really wasn't that bad of an organization at first, that its real mission was to protect women and children when NBF founded it, etc.  Whether or not you believe any of that or not (my purpose in mentioning it is not to start an argument on race relations), I don't think that's appropriate content for a guided tour and it didn't have any relevance whatsoever to the content of the home.  It cast a pall on the entire experience of the Victorian Village and made me reconsider wanting to visit any more homes of people who owned slaves.",December 2013,Victorian Village Historic District,"The Mallory-Neely House was worth it, had a bad experience at Woodruff-Fontaine",busitrav33,30

Only two Civil War battles were fought on the ground in Memphis and they were short ones.  The Mississippi River tells quite a different story.  It was very active during the Civil War.  A lot of history here.  My great great grandfathers first wife lost her first husband just a short distance north of Memphis when the Sultana sank.

Security was very lax getting in  - I'm used to having to dump out my entire purse to get in a game, which wasn't necessary here.  Didn't try the food, but it looked like your typical stadium/game food.  The alcohol lines were awful!! They were VERY understaffed and the women staffing the booths weren't very friendly. Lots of frustration from many of us who waited in lines for over 30 minutes to  get a drink.  This was the worst part of the game for us.  No other issues.

Definitely the easiest time I've ever had getting to my seats at an event. The venue is a little dated but I felt it had most of the amenities. I read other reviews about it being understaffed but they must have fixed most of those problems. Also the halftime show was actually the Commodores, while they are not a huge headliner anymore still was cool to see a Motown legend in person.

"i've been on Beale  a lot of time before but on the 14th of December I had the worst experience ever on Beale.I'm a black man going to the New Daisy with my white friend who is also a male and we were going to see a local group called Southern Creed.I ordered the tickets online thinking it might be a sold out show.They were a very poplar local band in the late 70's in Mephis.When I ordered the tickets online,the website said the you go to will call to get your tickets.When I get down there they said that I wasn't on the will call list so they would not let us in.I would have to come with a confirmation number from the website I ordered the tickets from.Which meant I would have to go all the way home,print out the page with the confermation number to get in to see the show.I told them if I have to go all the way home to prove I ordered the tickets with a confirmation number,i'm coming back to get my moneyback.He said I could get my money back when I come back with my confirmation number.Mind you now i'm watching people (white) coming in with no problem being found on the list but i'm the only one who has to prove by going back home that I actually bought tickets.I told my friend that I ndidn't want to see the show but I was only come back to get my money back.So he paid15 dollars to see the part of the show I missed because I had to go back to the house.After leaving the parking lot and paying 10 dollars to park,I come back to the New Daisy with my confirmation number. I see my friend who I bought the other ticket for and he said that they found his name on the list. A name I provided on the website but they didn;t see mine.They gave him his money back.I told them that I had no interest in seeing the show because I missed the first act and I wanted my money back.He said I couldn't get my money back at the theater but I would have to come back and talk to the manager 3 days later who he claims wasn't there that night.He apologize and offered me a beer to forget the whole thing and I told him I don't drink beer,I just wanted my 38 dollars back.I found out the next day that my freind decided to look on the list where his was on and he said that my name was on the list but it was crossed out as to appear somebody else got in using my name.DONT patron this racist club and I would not recommend even going to Beale.Rufus Thomas would always say that Beale has change and not necessarily  for the better.You're not going to find the blues on Beale street anymore.I walked by B.B.

"This is a great entertainment venue for live performances. Only drawback is limited seating. Floor level is standing room only except for some VIP booths around the perimeter that you can purchase for an upgrade. As ladies wearing high heels, I am soooooo thankful we did the upgrade. Never would have made it standing through an entire show. The upgrade was $60 per person, but $100 of that went toward our bar tab. We shared the VIP area with others, There were two long sofas arranged in an L-shape. There was the little velvet rope segmenting off our booth from general admission. We had a few people cross the rope and want to sit in the section with us.

We were in Memphis and wandering around Beale Street and stumbled across this unusual theatre. After a long week of walking and seeing the sights in Memphis and Nashville we decided to take it easy and see a show in The Daisy. The box office was closed but there was a sign at ticket window saying tickets would be for sale between 1-4 PM. We came back and were able to purchase tickets easily. We saw Dweezil Zappa and sat in the balcony. The view from our seats were great and the theatre was very personable and a great venue for my concert collection. They were serving cocktails (not just beer) as well as had the side doors open so people could go in and out and smoke if they chose too. I wish I had purchased the sound check tickets as Dweezil cam out into the crowd after  and gave out and signed show posters for whoever had purchased upgraded tickets.

"This is an interesting church. Looks like a castle from the front. Although I am not a practicing Catholic and my parents wanted to make a Pilgrimage to other Catholic Parishes this one was very interesting despite having Saturday Mass at 5 pm in the evening since my parent do this in our Parish of St John Bosco back in  Chicago. They both notice the mass peculiarities. 1st peculiarity was that we with the exception of an African American Couple attending as well was a Minority at the Mass. The Parishioners were all Caucasian. The 2nd peculiarity was that the majority of the attendees did not give money for the church when the servers with the basket come to collect the donations. It was quite odd. Other than that, It was a pretty looking Historical Church of Memphis. I learned something as I read the Historical Marker of how the Catholic Nuns and Priest of Dominican Order had a Malaria Outbreak in Memphis.

I went for the permanent collection, which boasts some of the finest impressionist and post-impressionist holdings outside of Europe.  It did not disappoint.  I found myself face to face with over 30 exquisite works by Monet, Cezanne, Renoir, Degas, Pisarro, Seurat and many others.  These are marvelously displayed in a former private home, placed on the walls of beautifully furnished rooms with NO velvet ropes, screaming kids, or glass or plexi protections.  Quality lighting and presentation add to an experience that I enjoyed most of the time with Nobody else in the room!!!  If thats not enough, the price of entry? free! ( sat am).

"I've been to Memphis several times, but this past weekend I visited the Dixon for the very first time. And I really enjoyed the experience! The gardens aren't huge, but they're very nice, and there are lots of tables to sit and enjoy the gardens. But the gallery was lovely. Right now, they have two exhibits on abstract expressionism: ""Abstract Expressionism: A Social Revolution, Selections from the Haskell Collection"" and ""Friedel Dzubas: The Ira A. Lipman Family Collection"" (both through January 5, 2020). I haven't had many opportunities to see such modern exhibits at museums, and I really enjoyed both exhibits. In addition to those temporary exhibits, the gallery has a permanent collection area, a small area that displays art by local artists, and a small cafe and shop. I recommend going when there is an exhibit you're interested in (because the permanent collection is very small), but I thought the $7 admission for adults was very fair and our visit very enjoyable overall. I'd certainly go back when I'm next in Memphis to see their next temporary exhibits!

The bartender makes no specialty cocktails so don’t ask if you don’t want a rude response.  I asked for a French connection and he waved his hand and said ‘I don’t know what that is’.  So jack and coke it was for the night.  It was a small bar with somewhat of a karaoke band because the little old man singing sat down the entire time and in-between notes he would try and catch people off the street to come in. There is a wall of any type of liquor you may want lined up except for grand marnier liqueur. So I guess it’s safe to say this is a man’s bar and no catering to the women.  It was cool just to sit around and hear the little band sing for perhaps 30 minutes or so and keep it moving to the next.,January 2014,Handy Park,Basic Booze No Cocktails,Tarra A,30

There was plenty of police officers scattered throughout the Festival area, the main streets that people were walking to and from their hotels/Beale Street, and of course, on Beale Street itself. I felt safe the entire time. Kudos to Memphis for making this a safe and easy trip for visitors! The music at the fest was great, and there were lots of great bands located on Beale Street itself as well. I wasn't terribly impressed with the shopping selection, but we ate at the Pig on Beale and were satisfied (see my review on that).

So it works out you are paying $5 for this entry and I think that is a fair price as I would think anymore would not be worth it. Location wise, it's on Beale St beside the Hard Rock Cafe and open until 7pm so it was handy to check out when some other museums closed at 5pm so you can leave them for last on your tour of the attractions. If you have been to Rock'n'Soul Museum, Sun Studios and Graceland, there's not alot of anything new here. And because of that it doesn't take up alot of time to go through. It is very nicely set up though. And one piece made an impression on me, in Graceland you learn that Elvis liked to be ahead of the curve technology wise and he had one of the first ever micowaves, here there is an early mobile phone/cell phone/prtable phone that he used called a briefcase phone from around 1968. that was the highlight for me, I also picked something up in the gift shop as it was at a better price than it had been in a souvenir shop on the main Beale St stretch.",February 2017,Memphis Music Hall of Fame,"Got in combo deal with Rock'n'Soul Museum, you don't need that much time",cjudge109,30

Downstairs there is a selection of vending machines, the shops (nothing special) closed due to time of day. Outside the main building the platform is very close, no complicated walkways or journey to your train, out here you can stretch your legs, smoke or In my case converse with others heading north, as for access to the station I'd always get a taxi but if travelling light it can be walked from central Memphis.

I made note of the places that I wanted to visit during my week-long stay. One of the things that stood out to me was the beautiful Riverbluff Walkway area. It ran along the Memphis side of the edge of the Mississippi River. I saw people enjoying their evening strolls along the riverside as sunset became golden and glistened on the water. It is a great place for enjoying the view and getting exercise at the same time. From that vantage point, I couldn't resist photographing the Hernando de Soto Bridge that connects Interstate-40 between W. Memphis and Arkansas.

"We went through here, needing to kill a little time before dinner.  It was inexpensive enough, and it did take about an hour to take in the exhibits in the single large room.  Some were more interesting than others, naturally, but overall, it wasn't bad.  There weren't many people there when we were there, so we virtually had the place to ourselves.  Some listening stations scattered about provided opportunities to hear some tunes, though they seemed cumbersome at best to get to work.  There were a couple of other interactive stations that were interesting, but you really had to search for those.  Not totally disappointed with the place, but also not the best place we visited in Memphis.",October 2018,Memphis Music Hall of Fame,Inexpensive way to kill some time,ClareBear5532,40
We had some time to kill before seeing another attraction and this was close by so we checked it out. We did not get the combo ticket due to time restrictions. There was certainly some cool memorabilia and stage costumes there. We didn’t take time to really listen to the history audio spots that were available to learn more in depth music history.

However, unlike another Indian Village in Ark. from the same time period there wasn't much to look at here. There were signs talking about the Chucalissa  and there was the main mound (Sans building that is shown in a photo here), a falling apart Dugout canoe and there was one replica hut that looked as though is was being used for storage. All in all it was a nice short visit to end our trip.",March 2016,The C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa,Interesting way to spend less than an hour.,Inky1231,40
"The film presentation was good. The museum exhibits are some exceptionally done miniatures, but some of them are coming apart and need some attention. They had a case at the front that required you slide the drawers out to see the exhibits, the drawers were hard to pull out and the printing done on colored paper made it hard to read, so I only ended up looking at 4 drawers out of about 12 I think. The Choctaw video they had going was so loud it carried through the entire building. Now, that video was something I would have liked to see in the theater. It was really long, I watched 20 minutes of it and I still hadn't gotten to the place I started watching. I quit watching because you have to stand and look up at a TV screen, so it's not very comfortable. They had a room where you could see how archeologists do digs (geared towards school children) that was nice and had someone in the room to help you with the displays. I walked the 1/2 mile trail, the trail head sign said to go right, so I did, but as I got along the trail, the signage didn't match the map, I was actually going backwards. I don't think it made much of a difference in the end, except that I had steps going down instead of up hills on the trail. The ""bluff overlook"" was nothing special and their safety rail was broken and laying on the ground. The trail itself is full of tree roots, so I would not advise taking small children on it or people who have a hard time walking on un-level surfaces. I do believe they rated it as ""moderate"" at the trail head. The staff were really nice and pleasant to talk to. The gift shop had some nice things in it.

"We go regularly, but it is a music marathon of three days of music. Usually the stages are grouped according to music style, and there is a blues tent (covered if it's raining) and three other big stages. If it does rain can get pretty muddy, so recommend wearing the big rubber boots, they are a fashion statement here. You can bring a backpack, and we brought a blanket, and when dry we sat off to the far side and still could hear and see great. You can get a three day pass for what you would spend on a single day pass to Lollapalooza. We saw a great lineup:Chvrches, Good Charlotte, Dave Matthews, Shinedown, Echosmith, Miley Cyrus, Moon Taxi,  Rainbow Kitten Surprise, One Republic,  Everclear, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Flogging Molly, Lord Huron and the Killers over 3 days! Tips are to get a locker for all three days and they you only have to carry stuff in and out once! Bring a water bottle and can refill it they do have sunscreen stations so you don't need to pack that. Some years they run out of toilet paper, this year it was the hand sanitizer, so I always pack some of each. Lots of good food available and be prepared for a lot of walking and standing unless you pay WAAAY extra for VIP passes. They had a lot of electric scooters put around downtown for this, but if you are going, make sure to download the app and set up your payment info BEFORE you need to use one as wifi gets pretty sketchy in and around the venue.

The campground did have water and electric hookups for our RV which was useful as the evenings were quite warm and the air con was required.

"After our visit, I checked the website for the plantation and, under “A History of Enslavement,” it mentions that in 2009 staffers and volunteers started to research the men, women, and children enslaved by the Davies family and pieced together a significant amount of information.  Much of this information comes from papers left behind by the Davies family, including birth ledgers for slaves, promissory notes, bills of sale, estate documents, and correspondence.  The website also mentioned the exhibit “Omitted in Mass: Rediscovering Lost Narratives of Enslavement, Migration, and Memory Through the Davies Family’s Papers.”  This is what we were hoping to see, but our docent failed to mention it and we probably passed by it without notice.

It's great to see good things happening in Memphis and the Edge Motor Museum is one of them.  This museum just opened in May and has not even had their grand opening yet but it is quickly becoming a must see for Memphis.  The museum is small but has an amazing quality collection of cars along with an incredible amount of information on the history of cars and each of the cars on exhibit.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Don't hesitate to ask them a question.  Each car has an iPad that can be used to get the story of each car.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit.

Nash Museum at Chucalissa,Get away from the city for a little Native American History,DezP13_1,40
"Went here when I was on a middle school field trip. It was great! It had a museum with cool Indian stuff from way back in history. It had a couple of real Indians making crafts. The greatest thing though was not that they had a couple of Indian mounds (little hills) and a replica Indian house to see, it was the dig site. They had an archeological dig site of one of the mounds and they had a path through it cordoned off so you could look at the artifacts the found right where they were discovered. There were even bones and I remember a person with a hole in there skull that the tour guide explained we know they lived after the skull was opened because there was healing around the opening in the skull. Sadly, that was then and this is now. Now, one kid works the desk taking up six dollars per adult visit. The museum is still there and it’s still good and nicely done. Unfortunately there was only one family besides me in the parking lot. When you come out of the museum there are only two mounds to see and the replica house is padlocked so you can’t look inside. The information placards have weathered and show their age. The sidewalk is cracked and in places overgrown with grass. The wonderful dig site and the biggest reason to come here is closed to the public!!! There is no information that it exists and no pictures of the inside of the dig building are posted. This place was so interesting and cool because of the dig site when I was a kid, that I have gone to every childhood field trip site looking for it as an adult. I even came here to find it again when I first got married to show my wife, but thought I was in the wrong place because it was not open or mentioned at the location. No Indian craftsman on site, and no tour guide with cool info either. The main mound front and steps are concrete colored to look like the dirt steps they would have been 1000 years ago but sadly there are cracks in the concrete and it just looks run down. Really a disappointing trip and other than the museum, a depressing let down. ",July 2018,The C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa,Not the same as when I was young,K4953JPrichardd,20

"My new bride and I had our wedding at the Litcherman Nature Center. When we first booked the director was very nice and accommodating. We noticed that the closer it  got to the wedding, the more she began to change and renege on her word. She assured us that if no one was using the facility that we could begin decorating a little early, and that we could use one of the downstairs rooms. My bride stood for at least two hours while waiting on the wedding to start. Mrs. Walsh continued to pant, rant, and rave, while pacing back and forth, making gestures. She approached us with questions about being in the building. We felt harassed and discriminated against. She even had the audacity to addressed my bride on her wedding day about her resting her feet and sitting in a room after we had just paid an additional $300.00 to use the venue for an extra hour. Who would have thought we wouldn't be able to sit in a chair after spending close to $2000.00. She even locked doors to prevent the wedding party from using the restrooms and she continued to followed us throughout the facility complaining that we didn't pay to use the room. The whole problem with this picture is that she initially told us that we could. Then to add insult to injury, she changed the black employee who had help throughout the whole process to a different shift and replaced her with a white employee who watched us all night. This employee continued to enter the kitchen, wedding and reception as if she were there to spy on us. Mrs. Walsh also complained to our wedding party that we did pay for the room. This was very unprofessional and she had absolutely now regards to our feelings, emotions, nor how unhappy we were. She continued to ruin our day. Although we were very upset and frustrated we remained a class act. Her actions were unacceptable and unnecessary. We would have gladly taking care of any further obligation at a latter time.That wasn't the time for it. We had already heard that she treats certain people differently. When I addressed her later about how rude she was, she stated, and I quote, ""I was nice to you people."" I am very disappointed in the rudeness of this director and how she treated paying customers.

"There are many attractions in Memphis, and I found out about the Lichterman Nature Center while visiting the new Tennessee Welcome Center in downtown Memphis, which is easy to reach when you take the first exit off of the I-40 Bridge as you are coming in from Arkansas.  Although many people would prefer to see Elvis Presley's home, or Beale Street, etc., I have made many trips to Memphis, and have seen many of the sights, but I had never visited this nature center before, and the thought of taking a nice stroll through the Tennessee woods, and enjoying nature, while still in the city of Memphis intrigued me.  It's located on the southeast side of the city, just east of I-240, and surprisingly about a mile from the headquarters of International Paper on Poplar Avenue.  The park is fairly new, and very well kept up.  At the large, new visitor center I found exhibits about the history of the nature center, and how it developed from a private estate, once owned by the founder of the Piggly Wiggly Supermarket chain, and the wealthy Lichterman family, into a public park.  There were different sections to visit.  The area to the east contained several acres of woods, with various trails to follow.  I enjoyed this quiet area, and noted the various types of hardwood trees that grow in this part of Tennessee.  Another section took me through a meadow, with the various types of grasses, etc. that can be found in this area.  Finally, the eastern part had several lakes, which you could walk around, or cross on bridges and boardwalks.  What was interesting were the information markers along the trail around the lakes, that detailed the history of Memphis, and the problem the city had in the 19th Century with the lack of fresh water, sewage, and the various swamps around the city that bred mosquitoes and led to terrible epidemics of yellow fever, that killed thousands.  It was only around 1900 that they discovered there was fresh water underground in a deep aquifer that could supply the city with fresh drinking water, and the swamps could be drained to control the mosquito population, and make the yellow fever epidemics a thing of the past.  The development of the city water and sanitation department enabled Memphis to grow into the large and unique city that it is today.

"The best thing about this self tour is that if you have the Q-code scanner on your phone, you can scan the codes they have around the home and read information about the artifacts, etc. on your phone. No waiting around or trying to squeeze your way through people to peer into a room. You can freely walk around and not all rooms are blocked off with ropes. The architecture is interesting and what is cool is that you can walk all the way up to the top and experience the widow's peak, which has a great view of the gingerbread house in the backyard. Though it is warm up there and the narrow staircase to get up there is a little steep; however, it opens up to a resting spot before getting all the way to the top. The staff if very friendly and helpful. We spent maybe 1 to 1.5 hours there on a hot day. We wanted to see the inside of the Lee House, but that was not an option, so we were glad to tour the Woodruff-Fontaine next door. This is only one of three houses on what was millionaire row back in the day. We walked here from the Madison Hotel, but you'll probably want to take Uber or a cab here.

"This house is one of two close together on Adams Avenue. This house was built in 1870, was vacant for quite a period during the mid 1900's than restored. And it is really magnificent. Of all the houses that we have toured on our trip to Memphis and Mobile, this one was our favorite. It just speaks to you of the grandeur of the 1870-1930 period... of the millionaires who lived on Adams Avenue, and of the money made and spent in Memphis.

"As we neared the end of our afternoon Beale St. walk we were invited into this museum by a staff/volunteer outside.  I’m so grateful he reached out to us because we might have passed by too quickly in our end-of-tour hunger.  This gallery is arresting in its stunning significance and its powerful visual beauty.  The story of Dr. Withers is itself worthy of national recognition; the body of his work is priceless.  His family and heirs created the museum and they staff and manage it.  It is up and coming as well- as they are digitizing over a million photos from black and white to color and spanning his life’s work.  This is a national treasure and an American story told in a most beautiful photographic language.  I must experience this again.  It is underpriced.

"My husband and I toured the Woodruff-Fontaine House on a weekday afternoon with about four other adults and a child who was much better behaved than some of his caretakers. The house was beautiful, and it has an interesting history. However, our guide, while friendly, seemed to be new and relatively uninformed. She was not able to answer many questions, and she was easily distracted by the people who were freely touching all of the antiques and heading into rooms that were off=limits, so she did not seem to be able to string together the stories of the families that lived there very well. We were allowed to see most of the house, including the cupola at the top of the tower, so that was a nice treat. If you like historic homes, give this one a shot.

"I wouldn't call Cooper-Young a district.  It's a neighborhood (known best for the intersection of Cooper and Young Streets) that is part of the larger Midtown area.  The houses are bungalows, craftsman style, etc. - nothing flashy, but people here are loyal to the neighborhood and want it to thrive.  The food options are some of the best in the city - Alchemy, Sweetgrass and Next Door, Beauty Shop, Stone Soup Cafe.  Don't come expecting a large ""district"" to explore, but do come for the food (Sunday brunch at Beauty Shop, for instance) and stroll though some of the small shops.  The street festival in September is fun.  This is a tolerant neighborhood, and unlike what some have said, it's not unsafe.  Yes, there have been incidents at night, but it's an urban area.

My husband and I had just left the Slave home not too far from here and decided to stop in and tour the mansion.

The lady at the desk give you a brief history of home and your tour on your own - sometimes this is nice - but sometimes nice if you have a tour - so you can get some history of the home.  The home has been remodeled from what she told us - but they have done a great job.  It was decordated for Christmas - so that was nice.  The home beautiful and there were so many great things to see.  Alot of furnishings.  I had read alot about it being haunted - but no sightings here.  We were getting ready to leave and a young lady outside (one of the ladies working there) ask if we saw the basement.... I didin't know we missed it....so make sure you go down stairs.

"From the 1940s and into the 21st century, Ernest Withers took over a million photographs, many of which are still being documented and archived.  This museum is clearly a labor of love that brings some of his best images together in a representative sampling of his photographic themes, most notably the Civil Rights movement, music, and sports.  It was both educational and jarring to see photos of National Guard soldiers and tanks right on Beale Street, in the aftermath of a race riot - but that's just one of many surprises offered in this superb collection.  The red couch, table, and carpet in the above photo are all gone, replaced with a welcome desk and an area displaying souvenirs, but the full brick wall on the right hits many of the well-known and lesser-known touchstones of the Civil Rights movement, featuring Mr. Withers' photographs of a bus boycott, voting rights issues, Little Rock, several of Dr. Martin Luther King and his aides in a display of a good 50+ photos.  The left wall and a room in the back focus on African-American performers in music and dance, and a back wall is dedicated to a Negro baseball team in Memphis, and other sports.  Admission is standardly $10/person, but they were offering free admission and a gift for Thanksgiving weekend.  I had lengthy chats with the museum director and a staff member named Jermaine, both of whom were friendly and quite knowledgeable regarding the exhibit.  The exhibit refreshingly blows up each photograph to a larger-than-customary size, so it's possible to see these in greater detail than in many books or websites, and also provides a large panel or two of narrative for each section, to set the context of the photos.  It's astounding the sheer diversity and number of people Mr. Withers has photographed. This is an important archive, and anyone seeking to bolster their visit to Beale Street with some good old American history should step inside and see what they have to offer.  Since the museum is still documenting and archiving Mr. Withers' work, the admission fee hardly covers that cost - so they do actively encourage purchasing items, but not in an overbearing way.  This is a welcoming space, an excellent stop on a day of pouring rain like today - but well worth seeing in any kind of weather.  I am a historian who has done archiving and research, and have visited all 50 states.

"My family was only in Memphis for the day last Christmas break enroute to Dallas, but when our fireman-obsessed toddler discovered this museum across the street from our hotel, of course we had to check it out. Turns out it's easily the best one we've ever visited. As luck would have it, not only was Fireman Sam working that day, but the museum was virtually empty since it was a Monday morning, so he literally got a private tour with Fireman Sam, which included dressing up in full gear, ""driving"" to a fire in a 1967 LaFrance pumper, putting out a virtual fire in the arcade, a room with a simulated kitchen fire (the room actually heated up), an escape maze, etc. plus loads of large and small-scale displays with everything from fire brigade buckets to rows and rows of antique helmets. It was such a fun morning that of course we didn't want to leave, but the fire hat and badge he took home (and still proudly wears and displays prominently in his room) serve as a constant reminder of not only all the fun he had in Memphis, but how truly selfless and courageous firefighters are. I'm convinced Fireman Sam's generosity and kind spirit are a big reason our trip to this fire museum is one of his earliest memories. I hope we can visit again one day.",December 2014,Fire Museum of Memphis,By far the best fire museum we've ever visited + my toddler's first memory!,Nina M,50

These are stunning photos depicting the history of civil rights in Memphis, the Memphis music scene and the Memphis Red Sox baseball team. The photos really tell a story. Withers, the photographer, captured the spirit of people who's civil rights were denied and suffered the consequences. They are not sad photos but show people determined to gain their place in society. These photos tie in well with a visit to the Civil Rights Museum.

I'm sure Dr Withers would be very proud of what they've achieved.  I've worked as a photographer and found his black and white photos beautfiul, fascinating and awe inspiring the way the images captured such important moments in time.  Unfortunately I did not have enough time to visit the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, but the photos displayed along with adjacent written details provided good insight to the struggle and was very thought provoking indeed.

Didn't see the museum but the site of the steam boat brought back memories. If we knew about it we would have surly seen it.  In fact it was twice we rode 2 of those paddle wheelers. The 1st was in 1989 it was the Delta Queen on a 5 day 4 night outing from Memphis(11th state) to Saint Louis(12th state). The 2nd was on our great 30th anniversary year of 1997 on the Mississippi Queen going on another 5 day 4 night outing on the Ohio River but this time from Pittsburg(35th state) to Cincinnati(37th state). Sorry we never rode on the American Queen the 3rd and largest also the newest of those that were owned at that time with the same company. We did talk about another trip maybe on the Cumberland or Tennessee rivers. But with our 50 State Quest finished we could also explore one close to home on the Columbia River. The Delta Queen the smallest was so fun being our first time built with polished brass against elegant natural wood.  On the other hand the American Queen was like a modern floating hotel  & much larger but still keeping the steam boat feeling. We had our own veranda on that one. Both offered stops along the way to get out & explore. People plan a year ahead for these.  Each of them also played steam organ music herd from miles around. They did offer other trips up to 11 days if I remember. You will have to check to see what ones are still in service. Think Delta was almost a century old and herd stories of the others retired or going through a refurbish. Food & service is out of this world just like ocean liners. But in any case you must try any of them on any of the rivers that is a must for at least one time. The best part is your always in site of land on either side.

"I had to drag my son out after almost two hours in here. We walked right past the cool old fire trucks (the museum portion) and headed over to the kids area. There are fireman jackets and hats for them to put on, and several activities for them to enjoy. I think the favorite was the driving simulator from the station through Memphis to the scene of the fire - if you're not the driver, you can man the sirens and horns. My favorite was manning the fire hose to try to douse the four(?) story blaze. The fire pole was a big hit of course (though I expected it to be longer). Upstairs there is a simulation you can experience as if you are inside during the progression of a house fire; it gets hotter, you see how quickly the smoke fills the room.

That turned out to be a lot of fun.  When you get to the lake, you get bombarded with Canada Geese, Slider Turtles, and fish.  A must.  The map that the center gives you is not the best, but the signs along the trail work out just fine. The highlight of the trip was seeing a family of racoon living on the forest bottom.  They were located along the tree top /forest boardwalk.  They were too cute. The kids also loved to sit and watch the birds fly in and out and try to guess what type they were.

We had the museum to ourselves. The children could wear fire coats and hats as they toured the museum. They could slide down a real brass fire pole, drive simulated fire trucks and ambulance all complete with real sounds and working parts. Ole Bill a retired fire horse gave a speech about stepping back in time as he pulled the fire engine. There are class rooms, training about fire safety in the home, views of the old locker rooms.

"New developments always carry a certain amount of risk. Redeveloping (or, in this case, repurposing) an existing locale likely carries even more risk. But the folks who repurposed the old Sears Crosstown into the Crosstown Concourse got this one right. It is a fabulous facility with - for architecture wannabe's - a terrific use of the existing structure. You've got to stop by simply to take in the awesome atriums and accompanying upstairs facilities. The Concourse already has a few eateries and a small grocery store.  It's still in development, but I can see this being one of those ""Memphis gems"" for years to come.",December 2017,Crosstown Concourse,They Got This One Right,Ken B,50

I was truly impressed with this quaint museum.  The staff was so friendly and took their time to explain who Withers was (MLK's photographer).

They are so much fun if you like architecture, opulence, history, and seeing something different in a city.

Our guide was wonderful, so full of information about the house and the families who lived there. The house itself is quite beautiful, and it has just had all its rooms reopened after an extensive replacement of all its many windows. Admittedly, there are some rooms, particularly on the second floor, which could use a bit more restoration, and you  don't get to see the third floor at all. What makes the Mallory-Neely House so special, though, is that its last owner lived in it until she passed away, so ninety percent of its contents are original, and they have written documentation to go along with the history and stories they relate during the tour. The staff was super friendly, answering more questions for us and recommending restaurants in the area after our tour.

"We took a trip on up to Memphis to get out on a rainy winter weekend. We had not been to Brooks in years and were delighted they had a Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit of painting done in Hawaii in the thirties.  The museum has a bit of everything from medieval religious, classic, impressionist and a larger American collection. I appreciated their feature of regional artists which touched on Memphis, its culture and history. There is a fun collection of the Memphis music scene in photographs. I am partial to Caroll Cloar who captured the rural Delta scenes and its folks so well.  We l certainly have to go more often; the staff is friendly and it is not so crowded that you can relax and take it in.  (Veterans get in Free!)

Plus the cost is so crazy inexpensive compared to what you play elsewhere. Small café and gift shop. Friendly staff.",January 2019,Memphis Brooks Museum of Art,Great exhibits!

The original Beaux-Arts building, a National Historic Landmark designed by James Gamble Rogers in 1913, was donated by Bessie  Vance Brooks in memory of her husband, Samuel Hamilton Brooks. The cylindrical extension, opened in 1955, was designed by Memphis architect Everett Woods. The complex also includes a museum store, cafe, garden and grand terrace that overlooks the greens and trees of Overton Park. The  art museum consists of 29 galleries, art classrooms, a research library with over 5,000 volumes, an auditorium, a print study room with over 4,500 works of art on paper and a collection of over 7,000 works of art, including paintings, drawings, sculptures, prints, photographs and examples of decorative arts. Paintings in the permanent collection include works by Italian Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionist and 20th century artists, English portraits by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Lawrence and Romney, impressionist works by Renoir and American impressionist works by Winslow Homer, Thomas Hart Benton, Childe Hassam and Robert Henri.

It is one impressive river and the museum captures much of this history.,July 2019,Mississippi River Museum at Mud Island,Museum still i excellent shape,Edward C,50
"This is a very nice museum, interesting displays, historical, educational, fun, well done.  Even has a recreation of a full size river boat.  A video presentation on disasters was not working.  But this museum suffers from one problem, it is hard to find.  Enter the address into your GPS and it takes you to a spot downtown with a very long elevated walkway and what is supposed to be a monorail to Mud Island.  Well my wife walks with a cane and cannot walk a half mile on the walkway to get to this museum, and the monorail is nowhere to be found.  So someone told us to drive to Mud Island over the blue bridge.  Well we first had to find the blue bridge, when we did, we drove to Mud Island and the only signs we saw were telling us how to pay to park using a smartphone.  We saw a building up above but no mention of a museum.  We called the phone number on the brochure, it was out of service.  So we took a chance, paid to park, and walked until we found the museum.  The area outside the museum was a play area for kids, with what appeared to be locals, who know how to get here.  A gift shop adjacent to the museum was out of business.  We paid our admission and enjoyed the museum, as well as views of the Mississippi River.  We were told that the brochure, the phone number, and the monorail were all obsolete.  Senior discount mentioned in the brochure was also obsolete.  While in the museum, we saw maybe three other people.  So catch this while you can, because without an accurate brochure, a monorail, or some signage, it won't last long.

From there we walked through some kudzu covered areas, guessed the names of some trees, found identification plaques on others. Lots of native plants with some landscaping plants in the mix. There are several small gardens through out, a wonderful building with exhibits on wildlife staffed by knowledgeable people who care for the animals and the plants in the butterfly garden. Plenty of free parking, picnic tables, places to hold weddings, reunions, etc. It's pretty dry looking in late August, but beautiful other times of year.",August 2018,Lichterman Nature Center,"Good for a walk, to enjoy nature, get ideas for your own garden",grip652,50

"We were looking for something to do on our last full day in the area, and we're really into nature centers. They had a nice visitors center, the gal at the desk was great. Even though we were there before they officially opened, she let us go on in and wander the grounds. Had good/well maintained and marked walking trails, nothing difficult to maneuver. Even though it was hot outside, the trails were mostly shaded and there was  a great breeze. Unfortunately, didn't see many birds on/around the lake, but was probably too hot for them at the time. They had another area with aquarium type displays. Their naturalist Mikyl (sorry if I misspelled!) was ""training"" two o'possums that they have raised from babies, and did a great presentation for just a few of us. Was very helpful, knowledgeable!

"The Mallory-Neely House offers visitors a classic example of how the wealthy lived in the Gilded Age in Memphis, Tennessee. Located at 652 Adams Avenue, in the city's Victorian Village district, it was built in 1852 in the Italianate style as an early Victorian villa. From 1852 until 1969, when the last resident of the house died at age 98, the house was home to five different families. The three-story structure with a tower underwent extensive renovation in the 1880s and 1890s, expanding to 25 rooms with parquet flooring, ornamental plasterwork and ceiling stenciling. In 1972, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The following year, it was adapted for use as a house museum, featuring furnishings of the Victorian era. The public is admitted on Fridays and Saturdays. A ramp allows entry to the first floor. The carriage house serves as the ticket office, where visitors can begin their tour by watching a 20-minute video about the museum.",September 2019,Mallory-Neely House,One of the great antebellum mansions of Memphis,Taylor B,50

It was a struggle to get direction to the best brochures for our limited time and interests.  One lady finally called one hotel with an outrageous price tag, which we had to decline. She then called another hotel that was more reasonable and made a reservation for us.  The place was a scary & stinking dump.   The room smelled too bad to even step into.

I think they would go without the Duck Master. The Duck Master gives the history behind the walk.  Everyone was so loud, it made it almost impossible to hear him, even though he had a mic. I missed a lot of what he said. It’s sad the world we live in that people are so rude and allow their children to be rude when someone is presenting or talking. Peabody needs a better system so you can hear near the elevators. It sounded like their speaker is in the dining area. We got there about 45 minutes early. Hardly anyone there, but within a few minutes it was packed with people trying to push themselves to the front. They allow the children to sit beside the red carpet.

If you have just arrived in Memphis and you honest to goodness don't know anything about what you'd like to do, then yes, by all means, go. But honestly, I learned more about what to do, see and eat in Memphis on TripAdvisor.  On a positive note, they have clean restrooms and air conditioned places to sit, which is fantastic on a hot, sunny day.  I was hoping for a water fountain, and I'm not convinced they didn't have one, but I didn't see it.  They did have some vending machines though.  One interesting thing they had that I didn't see anywhere else was a Civil War information display.  It gave information on the war and offered brochures of other Civil War sites in Tennessee that you could visit. All in all, sure, it's informative, and if you need basic of basic info, it will help you.

The exhibits are nicely done, but the thing I enjoyed the most is that periodically about 3 or 4 times, there are juke boxes in the museum with 10 or 12 selections.  You can listen to any or all of the songs on the juke boxes.  You are in control of the audio tour and you can listen to as few or as many songs as you would like.

(Does cost extra) and a very excellent sea lion show (free).  Lunch at the cat cafe was good, fed family of 5 for $50. The zoo does allow you to bring in your own food.

"When we arrived at Memorial Park we went straight to the office to request a map of the cemetery so we could easily find the grotto.  The staff was most gracious and even offered to give us a tour of the grounds to see all of the points of interest like the Crystal Shrine Grotto.  The grounds are beautiful and well maintained.  We drove through the cemetery to the Grotto, parked there and enjoyed the walk to the grotto including a short hike alongside a waterway filled with Koi.  We should have grabbed the complimentary food at the office for the Koi.  They came right to the edge of the pond looking for a munchie. There was a man made tree to walk through, a wooden bridge to cross and naturally the grotto itself.  Stay to your left when you enter to see the story of Christ in proper sequence.  We goofed and went to the right.  Either way its a beautiful depiction of the life of Jesus.  If religion isn't your thing, that's fine but don't miss the opportunity to explore the grotto, the artwork inside is beautiful and very unique.  I think my favorite was the Last Supper.  Another point of interest at the cemetery was the Veterans Memorial Fountain.  Someone, I assume a guest, used ordinary rocks to form a small sculpture that they left on one of the columns thanking the Vets for their sacrifice.  You'll also see the grave-site of one of Johnny Cash's musicians. Take the time to drop by for a visit.  From their brochure, the Crystal Shrine Grotto is open 8:00 a.m.- 4 p.m. daily.  Also on the brochure was a safety tip, lock your car and don't leave valuables visible.",June 2017,Crystal Shrine Grotto,Interesting with great photo ops,Linda S,50

"My wife and I had the pleasure of seeing this concert at the FedEx Forum. We had parking right out the back. Easy to access from our seats. The seats are close and not a great deal of leg room for a 6'2"" 240 lb. man. I expected that would be the case. But, my wife was comfortable. That is what matters most, right guys. The building is well designed . There are plenty of food and drink vendors. There are ample restrooms. They keep the restrooms clean and presentable for the most part. A toilet over flowed in one restroom. This is not the maintenance teams fault, in my opinion. I think a patron caused that particular issue. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They do frisk you if need be and purses are checked. So don't try to come in with your own liquor,  water, snacks, or a weapon. They will be confiscated. The police and security are there and do a great job. I was very pleased with how safe my wife and I felt there. Also, I was impressed with how well the crowd behaved. The forum was packed. This is a great venue and we Memphians should be proud of it. If you have the means to see a concert or game here please do. It is a great venue to enjoy these in. We highly recommend it.

The enclosures were well kept, and large enough that you didn't feel bad for the animals. They had ""keeper talks"" at different times across the zoo...we only made it to a couple of them due to timing. The one for the penguins was wonderful! He told us things about penguins that we had never heard anywhere else! The zoo was clean, bathrooms were well kept. The only complaint (which was understandable due to time of year) was that most of the restaurants/shops weren't open due to number of people there.

The playground is great! There is a huge sand area with a slide. Make sure you bring your child beach toys. Our little one kept wanting other kid's toys because I didn't bring any. Found some toys in the Suburban he could play with. Make sure if you have little boys take tractors or cars and something they can fill with sand. That was his favorite. The next playground was nothing but huge slides. He had so much fun on those. My husband stayed at the bottom and I stayed at the top. That worked out great because the slides are steep, but he had no problem climbing back up because they have something like rubber padding down instead of steps. Our older children walked the area while we played. They is an outdoor exercise area. They really liked that. Next time they said they're bringing their bikes. After they walked and exercised they went to the water and sat on the benches watching people fish and the ducks. Will definitely go again.

"In total transparency, my family & I were in Memphis about 4yrs ago & had planned on visiting the museum.  But when we arrived & saw the Burkle house....we were deterred & decided not to take the tour.  (smh).  However, this year while enjoying a family reunion in Memphis we decided that we were going to take the tour this time.  I AM SO GLAD THAT WE DID! Yes the look of the estate is not a traditional look for a museum but the information gained on this guided tour was priceless.  Our tour guide was EXCELLENT!  You could tell that this was her passion.  She helped you to feel & understand the history.  It was as if an elder of the family was imparting sacred family information to you.  Though we didn't enter a few years back..it worked out for our good because my youngest child is older and was able to understand the history for himself.

This is about the information and the guide she had lots of it. It was eye opening and amazing to learn how resilient and resourceful HUMANS can be. These unjustly treated people found ingenious ways to survive and were helped by other people who cared enough and were brave enough and human enough to be moved to do something. Our guide (I took too long to write this, I wish I remembered her name) had my mouth agape at times, at others she garnered a head shake and an eye roll, she was excellent.

There are also tables at the other end which allow for a little picnic. If you want to take selfies with a view pick your time of day carefully.

On Christmas Eve we wanted to enjoy the good weather and get the kids out the house so we visited The Big River Crossing. This an old bridge that crosses the Mississippi River that has been repurposed for pedestrians and bicyclists to go from Tennessee to Arkansas. It’s very cool and fun; you can rent electric bikes at both sides and there are portable potties at both landings. Best of all it’s free! There is a half way spot where you can take selfies with the memphis skyline in the background.

It was more modest than I imagined - given Elvis's superstar status. However, the stories behind some of his decorating choices were interesting. They were consistent with how a young man with a lot of money might design.  The jungle room, billiards room, and mirrored staircase are examples.

They did a very good job covering the history of slavery and showing the hardship and struggles to freedom. The films that were shown were very well done and most of the exhibits were effective. The exhibits wove around the building with the progression of time and the movement and ultimately brought you to the Lorraine Motel where Dr. King was shot. The rooms are displayed as if frozen in time. The second part of the museum is across the street from where the motel and museum are - in the old boarding house where the shooter had positioned himself. The whole second floor is a timeline of how the assassination was thought to have been planned and also included various conspiracy theories. It was too detailed and too long and really not relevant to the history and story of the movement. The main museum is definitely worth seeing. We felt comfortable and safe in the neighborhood the whole time we were there (I saw some other reviews that said otherwise). Be sure to look at the kiosks outside the building in front of the motel.

"Having been faithful to the original building, they've re-built it in the same spot in Soulsville. While it is a trip slightly out of the tourist centre (a 45 min walk from the civil rights museum, and through some fairly bleak area, so probably worth getting a cab), but it's well worth the trip, giving a great musical trip through the era and covering all the soul greats that were published on the label. It's uterly engaging and interactive with a 20 minute video followed by lots to see and listen to. It's visually very appealing and gives you just the right amount of information and heritage to bring it alive. This is a fantastic overview of the Memphis music scene. Also a great shop, but no cafe.",September 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,The heart of soul,D0ug101,50

Access was limited and although furnished as it was when Elvis lived there, the decor was a bit on the bizarre side. The lighting in the downstairs family room was dark which made it hard to see much.

You get an i-pad with earphones so you can spend as much time on the tour as you wish.  The reflective garden with their headstones is quite somber, as it should be.

In full disclosure, we were already huge fans of this music and students of this era of American history.  That being said, the museum blew us away.  The three hours we allowed ourselves was not nearly enough as each corner we turned brought new artifacts, sounds and experiences to enjoy.  Particularly nostalgic was standing in what I would call their hall of records, finding all the ones that were part of our personal collections.  It was also interesting (and sad) to learn of the business interplay with Atlantic Records and FAME  studios (previously visited) that ultimately led to the demise of the iconic Stax label.

It brought back so many memories.  They even had one of Isaac Hayes' cars on display.  The number of records recorded there was amazing.  It also reflected a time when, within that era of music-making, race was not an issue.  They all got along, whether White or Black.  After Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was killed, that all changed.  Eventually Stax Records went out of business in 1974, but their legacy will live forever.  A really fun part of the museum was the dance floor where they urge everyone to ""Express yourself!""

It took about an hour to go round and as we were early it was easy to move around to see everything.

We were really looking forward to visiting Stax and it did not disappoint.  Great stories and history.  Kudos to those with the foresight to bring this history back for all to embrace. ,April 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,Soulsville's a Hit,692stephenj,50
This is a wonderful museum with lots of important history on music in the U.S.  Well worth a visit when in Memphis.,March 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,Wonderful museum.,karengF4022FT,40
I'm so thankful that I came here it was so moving. They did not teach me any of this in school. There was a young man who gave an informational tour of sorts.  He was so educated on the Civil Rights movement and black history I was totally enthralled in what he was teaching me. This is just a really amazing place I loved it and thankful for what I learned ,September 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Touching place,Dreamer792489,50
Great museum. Extremely well done. You do not realize till the end that you are in the Lorraine hotel. Very informative.,October 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Excellent,mmem7,50
The Civil Rights Museum is absolutely one of the best places I have even been. It is so informative and powerful. From the first room to the end it was laid out perfectly. It is worth it to go and see the history that shaped our country and learn how we can take more steps to improve even more.,October 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Amazing,Fronk89,50
My wife and I took two trips to the museum on our trip to Memphis. Standing in room 307 looking out over the parking lot and the very spot that MLK lost his life was truly one of the more numbing yet humbling experiences of my life.,October 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Humbling Experience,Frenchy85,50
"The tour of Graceland is informative for sure.  But my favorite part was going across the street and listening to live music and eating, just soaking up the stores and the enviornment immediately surrounding Graceland.  Not a great part of town though so secure your belongings.",July 2019,Graceland,Love the area,Dawn R,50
"You can't come to Memphis and not see Graceland, but once you do, it's unlikely you'll want to go back. It's also probably not worth any of the VIP+ packages, as they don't really get you much - supposedly you bypass the lines, but it's minimal at best.",October 2019,Graceland,"You have to see it, but...",307jons,30
My first time to visit and my friend and I took the self-guided tour.   The grounds were beautiful.  I enjoyed the museums and shops as well as snacking ice cream/ soda shop.  His costumes for his various performances were wonderful too.  ,July 2019,Graceland,Elvis was a special Man.,BobbiLB,50
More than just the house where he lived.  Museums have many interesting artifacts.  Learned a lot about his life. ,July 2019,Graceland,Loved it,Karen6703,50
"We had planned just to see the house but decided to see everything. It was amazing, very interesting. Elvis was a very generous, kind person. It's sad to see how he was exploited. We planned to spend an hour or two, but ended staying about 5. Found it to be very interesting. Much more to see than just the house. Would recommend paying a bit more to see everything. Cars, museums, artifacts of Elvis.",October 2019,Graceland,More than expected,kas22,50
"This is an excellent museum outlining the life, treatment and struggles of black Americans from their first arrival as slaves 400 years ago to the present day.   It is located in part in the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968.  I found this to be a very sobering and shameful story and there are still some prejudices that extend to this day.  I think the world would be much better if everyone  had the chance to view these exhibits.",October 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Wonderful and Sobering,CFofLL,50
"5+ stars for a great museum that really takes you back to the heyday of Soul music.  Interesting collections of costumes, records, even a Cadillac owned by Isaac Hayes.  Watch the short video to begin your self-guided tour. This museum was the highlight of my time in Memphis.",April 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,"If you love soul music, this is the place to go!",LynnTT,50
"Thank you to Stax Museum of American Soul Music. From the wonderful lady who talked to us before the movie, to the movie, to the contents of the museum, I came away with a good feeling about the early days of Stax. This is a place where black and white musicians played nicely together. There wasn't the segregationism in this studio that reared its ugly head all over the south. Yes, poor management decisions were made that ultimately led to the studio's demise, but the artists who worked here loved the atmosphere. This studio worked with the musicians to develop their own sound and didn't try to paint them into a corner to make them sound like someone else. We learned a lot. Allow a couple of hours. (The movie at the beginning is 20 minutes.)",April 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,Heart and Soul,daxkiten,50
"This was also the first museum of a recording studio that we visited where the civil rights issues seemed to have a bearing on the ending of the studio, which added a sad note to its history.",March 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,Not such a great museum,PathManSlough,30
Good to see still there.  Shame no ref to Elvis which was disappointing.  Glad we swung by though ~ important to Elvis fans like us.,April 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,Came because of Elvis,PaulAllenT,40
"This museum is a must whilst in Memphis, following the journey from the slave trade through to the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Across the road you visit the boarding house when the shot was allegedly fired. Really well presented and informative museum, giving you detailed accounts from individuals. Would thoroughly recommend. ",October 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Wow ,Bagnshoes2match,50
"An absolute must to see! What a great, well put together museum that every person should see and experience.  The moment you step Into the area where MLK slept and then just outside was shot is so heart retching it truly pulls at your heart and soul. Can not recommend this enough. ",October 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Wow wow wow ,Michelle A,50
"It was a great experience to see the museum. I think it was very personal and moving. Also when we went to see the room, there was a reverence by all walking through and a sense of sadness. We took 2 young men from Lithuania with us and they were informed about the civil rights struggle in the US.",August 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Very informative,Culture261459,50

A great place for the Elvis (or just general music) fan to visit.  Forget the shops in the main area - get on the bus and get to the house.   The museums are well worth seeing too.  Especially the cars/motorbikes.,October 2019,Graceland,Amazing house and gardens,s66blade,50
We enjoyed the tour of Graceland.  We were allowed to take pictures as long as the flash was off.  Very interesting.,October 2019,Graceland,Beautiful Graceland,Linda A,50
"I would have given my review 5 stars except for the fact that my headphones and iPad weren't functioning even after I asked someone to fix it.  Otherwise the Graceland tour was amazing.  I would recommend going later in the afternoon when the groups aren't as big so you don't feel rushed going from room to room.  But all in all it was a wonderful experience.  Everything has been frozen in time in the Mansion itself and the exhibits showing the personal items were amazing.  That's not even counting all the exhibits in the Elvis Experience across the street from the Mansion.  The Meditation Garden was such a surreal experience and was breathtaking.  The Elvis Experience went on forever with his cars, clothes/costumes, items they couldn't fit in the Mansion and the gift shops were aplenty with such unique items one could easily break the budget.  Would definitely go back again just to tour the Mansion.  If you want to splurge, I would definitely do the Elvis Experience your first time there.  The only thing we didn't do were the airplanes.  Might have to do that the next time we go.",September 2019,Graceland,Would go again and again,siggy3674,40
The overall experience was wonderful. To walk the grounds and to see Elvis’s home. The extensive collection of costumes and cars all very interesting. It is also rather sad to see it all he not only had short career but short life too. I don’t think he’d be too impressed with all the other stuff going on there like a amusement park not a home.,June 2019,Graceland,Bucket list trip,Scot-uk,50
"The way this site has been preserved is really clever. The whole original motel building has been preserved and the rest of the structure built behind the facade. The level of detail is incredible right down to the 1960s cars parked out the front of the motel rooms. The exhibitions inside largely deal with Slavery, segregation and integration - very somber and confronting subject matter done in a very tasteful way. A very important museum that everyone should visit. ",October 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Very interesting and well put together,739damienb,40
Enjoyed spending time here with my family. Lots of great music memoribalia to see. I recommend spending a few hours here. The gift shop is also fun. ,March 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,Lots of fun on a rainy afternoon,ninab22,50
"My wife and I so enjoyed it.

This was a great visit for me taking my kids to see this place was very emotional.  The outside looked like I had seen in history books and the stories had me teary eyed.  Being a student of history myself much was thing I already know about but it was just a lot to see in one place and especially the place that MLK died.  Sad I know personally people on the walls in the museum so I am pretty sure the racist geezers are still alive and kicking.  Sad that I had MAGA rally flashbacks seeing videos we come far but have a lot further to go.,October 2019,National Civil Rights Museum - Lorraine Motel,Amazing,JuarezJJackson,50
"Everything about the King was large, so very surprising to find his home is smaller than you would expect, that said, what a great day, lots to see and history made there is well displayed and full of facts. No chance of going up stairs so you didn't get to see his bedroom, but that aside an excellent day out, a must do for Elvis fans, across the road is the main museum area where his planes and cars and other items are displayed.

"I really enjoyed the additional buildings with the cars, outfits, army info, etc.  The area was clean, spacious, and informative.  (However, it may have given Disney a run for it's money with respect to number of gift shops.)  It was also fascinating to see Graceland itself, but that part was less enjoyable because even with staggered entry, it was REALLY CROWDED.  The overall price to do this was a bit steep.  We did not do the VIP tour and it was still $61 each.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as if we were going to say ""no"".  It just isn't worth the price, which is why I gave it a 3, even though we enjoyed the visit.  Just ridiculously expensive for what it was.",October 2019,Graceland,"Fun, but $61 each was a little stupid",Jacalyn1017,30

"We only scheduled two nights in Memphis as part of a roadtrip, which meant we visited Stax on the way into Memphis, after a long drive from Nashville. Sadly this meant we weren't in peak mode to fully enjoy it, and wandered around like a pair of zombies trying to soak it all up, all the while desperate to get to our hotel and crash. Interesting story behind the studio (and the local area), and offers a great trawl through the output, but schedule time to visit so you can absorb it properly!",May 2019,Stax Museum of American Soul Music,Isaac Hayes car!!,SooDenim,40
