Not really a public beach.,March 2019,20,Bal Harbour Beach,Brenda010,There is a nice walkway adjacent to the beach with very few seats....I don't think the residents wish to encourage visitors to hang around.
So so place,December 2019,10,Bayside Marketplace,Chew W,"Don't expect too much from this place! Expensive restaurants. Several stores try to sell tour, excursion, etc."
A little Rough,April 2018,30,Bal Harbour Beach,101CLUB,You have to find passages to the beach which is not an easy task.
Lovely and relaxing ,August 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,jeanette_evans2,No cafe so take your own - was a drinks vendor 
This is not a beach. It's a paradise.,June 2017,50,Bal Harbour Beach,RITAFM,"Nature, sea birds, fish, fishermen, pier, what else?"
Poetry in Pyjamas,April 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Sue H,"Visited the botanical garden in the morning and found it v interesting. Lots of plants and trees ...obviously... but also fish and turtles in ponds. Lots of butterflies. Free entry. Came back in the evening for poetry event, Fun place"
Very beautiful calm beach,February 2017,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Tenq101,"Easy access o beach. Soft sand, not crowded, friendly people. We were there in February and it was quiet"
An Immigrant (Cuban & Others) Experience!,September 2019,50,Little Havana,Timzorrr,"Go, there are many good things to experience there!"
Wow,May 2016,50,Fisher Island,Claire S,We cruised around this Island and was told about all the celebrities that live there.  This place can only be accessed by boat or by helicopter check it out yourself. Great shops and restaurants.
Bad service,March 2019,10,Miami Trolley,GasperExplorer,"The free trolley service seems to be a great idea but in reality, it does not operate that well. There is a schedule but based on the frequency I can probably reach my destination at that time by walking instead. It also does not seem like they ride completely on schedule because we were waiting at the station at the time when it should have arrived but it did not. About 10 minutes later there was one that just drove past the station and on it it said out of service. That happened to us a couple of times and since we did not spend that many days in Miami we decided to walk or use other kinds of transportations to get where we wanted"
Great Zoo in Miami,March 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Greatswag,"After visiting the Everglades, I was so inspired about nature that I decided to spend rest of my day in Miami Zoo. This was a great choice because so many terrific animals in very nice surroundings and good restaurant to eat lunch."
Sometimes a little scary and over-crowded...,September 2018,30,Miami Trolley,mra82,"I love the convenience of this being a free means of transportation around the city on its different routes, but some of the characters (by no means not everyone) on here are a little...interesting.  I've also been on the Biscayne route several times where the trolley is so over-crowded that you have no room to move at all.  That's a safety concern I have about it, but thankfully I haven't experienced that too often, as the public buses and ride shares seem to be a more popular way of getting around."
Very nice and good organization!!!,December 2016,50,Art Basel,rfrontal,Great place to see the best art in town. good value for the price plus very god logistic in all Art Basel's vents. Will come back this year again.
Great selection of Britto artwork!,December 2016,40,Britto Central,Vicki C,"Didn't realize a place like this existed until I stumbled upon it!  They have a great variety of Britto's works of art.  The employees there are knowledgeable and helpful. If you are a fan of Britto, you want to stop in!"
Wow,September 2016,40,Britto Central,PhilG294,We stopped in on our evening walk on Lincoln Road. I love the place. I saw some originals that I would love to buy - just too many digits in the price. But I did buy a small souvenir. You must visit.
Love this place!,August 2014,50,Miami Paper Museum,Naomi W,"Its a family business which adds that loving home feel to it. The owner Hernan was very kind and made a calligraphy bookmark with my name on. A beautiful souvenir I've kept with me throughout the years. Recently found out they moved and have an office in the Biltmore Hotel where they offer handmade paper invitations, i've yet to visit but am planning to in the weeks to come."
"Great beach, no lounge chairs to be had.",February 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Tom P,Great beach trail and well maintained. Do bring a towel and your own chair. The beach hotels will not allow you to use or rent a lounge chair. No lifeguards on duty.
Fabolous,October 2018,40,Dolphin Mall,Romina86VR,Excellent mall and always big discount! Plenty of stores inside and a big food court! I really recommend it!
Really enjoyed it,January 2018,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Marie-NYNY,Small museum conveniently located in Miami Beach's Art Deco district. Beautiful building with good collection of furniture and appliances from early 1900's.  The Julius Klinger exhibit with advertising graphics from early 1900's was fantastic.
Best day of my life! I met Limbani :),August 2018,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,omegan2016,Omega from Sri Lanka!
It depends what you want,May 2019,30,Dolphin Mall,LeahT987,"There are tonnes of shops, but it seems to be more like an outlet mall than a 'normal' mall, yet it didn't have the offers/range of an outlet place so we found it a bit confused. I was surprised that there was no Sephora too - but it was foolish of me to assume. Lots of eatery options and shops, but its worth looking up what you'd be interested in. It may not have been for us, but the lady at reception at our hotel said people often visited there for days, so it clearly appeals to many others!"
"Attractive, fun, magical",December 2015,50,Art Basel,pablo s,"Very cool setup. Lots of nice activities, for both kids and adults alike. Last year was amazing, this year should be double the incredible."
Is not as good as a few years ago,December 2015,30,Art Basel,Kathy C,"I prefer Red Dot in MidTown, we bought tickets right there day of show."
These people are thieves,July 2018,10,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,fydlstyx,Do not spend your money with these people.
Wow,September 2018,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Victor F,Definitely once in a lifetime experience getting to pet baby lions. Went for the 2hour tour. Got to see some amazing animals closer than any zoo I've been
A Must Do!,September 2018,40,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,adrenalinejunkie207,"My only recommendation to them would be to keep an eye on the restrooms (hubby said the men's room had no toilet paper or paper towels) and they really should make people use the hand sanitizer before handling the animals so the animals stay safe and healthy.  The bottle of Purell in the gazebo was empty.  Other than that, I have no complaints and enjoyed our visit to the ZWF.  I hope they can keep up their work with the animals and thank them for their efforts and allowing visitors to have such wonderful, hands-on encounters!"
Julius Klinger is a must-see,December 2017,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Christopher S,There is also a very good exhibition of prewar domestic appliances including a 1930s digital clock.
Nice beach whether you're staying at a hotel or not,March 2014,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Woody1811,"There's no food to buy or bathrooms to use on the beach itself that I could see, but you are able to walk into one of the many hotels on Collins and eat in the hotel restaurants, which then would give you access to food and restroom facilities."
Cool Stop Off Lincoln,May 2015,30,Britto Central,MeathookMike,Cool stop to make when walking Lincoln. A quick way to view some Miami artwork and escape the outdoor heat. A little bit for everyone in a variety of price ranges.
FREE plus WIFI on-board!,August 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Marcus H,"The Miami trolley is amazing!  First off it's FREE public transport - other cities take note - FREE!  There's FREE WIFI on-board which is very useful.  Also there's a fantastic FREE mobile app, giving you real-time location of the trolleys, plus their routes and schedules.  Parking is expensive in Miami - do away with the expensive & grief and take the trolley, it's fab!"
Miami bus tour including Little Havana,February 2019,50,Little Havana,amatterofstyle,"Worth every penny, on time schedules! Polite and friendly staff..seen  highlights of city and had boat tour included...only downfall which was annoying is the staff begging for tips...on the microphone, cheering at every tip deposited in their jar! Not necessary we know we should tip, it may have annoyed people enough ton NOT tip!"
Might not be leaving the beach for...,February 2018,30,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,atener_10,Surrounded by construction as of February 2018 which detracted from overall ambiance.  Not a very scenic walk to get there.  Free entry a plus.  May not be worth leaving the beach for.
Modish market area,July 2018,50,Miami Design District,sasithk,"Realism, modern, fashionable, well time and innovative art. Overall are always good figurative painters, the innovations in and out every square inch. Near by Museum. "
Charming street! ,November 2018,30,Espanola Way,Tripadvisbear,"However readers be aware! Just like Ocean Drive , the restaurants are a tourist trap! They will look busy and full of customers but the prices are super high and the food quality is super low! "
Nice place to find a nice restaurant,October 2018,30,Espanola Way,mjfreiresantos,Crowded at night with a huge variety of nice restaurants. Just walk around and enter a pleasant place or reserve in advance to avoid waiting time!  
A great way to get from place to place for free,June 2018,40,Metromover,TMACKSTER,There are many metromover stations throughout the downtown Miami area but it still may not be convenient depending on where you are. The good thig is that it's free and quick.
Easy,March 2019,50,Metromover,summergaze12,"One of the best ways to travel in downtown Miami! You avoid traffic, parking fees and overall expenses with this public transportation."
"Great, free way to get around. ",April 2019,50,Metromover,travelinteach,"Easy to use, free and safe at night. Two different loops make getting around easy. We used it after dinner at Bubba Gumps to get back to hotel at Hampton Suites by Hilton on Brickell. "
Beautiful Tropical Flowers,October 2018,40,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Dawn H," I like to buy postcards to use in my scrapbooks.  However, I really enjoyed my day there and I left with a lot of great pictures."
Lovely Florida attraction!,June 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Gablesgirls,Don’t miss the butterfly garden. Beautiful! It is always relaxing and educational to visit the gardens. My teen loves to photograph the fauna and flora!
"Beautiful gardens, lovely engaging volunteers",April 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Valerie D,I've been to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden twice now.  There is always something new to admire.  This is a relaxing oasis.  The butterfly garden is not to be missed.  
"Rare plants, Hummingbirds, and butterflies",November 2018,40,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,551ellenm,"The Botanic garden was nice. There is a lush shaded rainforest area with water flowing through the area that is relaxing. The butterfly house was amazing, so many beautiful varieties of butterflies everywhere! Also there was an adorable hummingbird in the enclosure. Just through the butterfly garden were some rare and interesting plants. One complaint was that there were people working there on golf carts who drive at a fast pace down walkways occupied by guests, I think I had to move out of the way 3 times. "
An amazing garden,November 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Gerard V,"We enjoyed our visit very much, first we took the tour with the trolley and the guide who was very knowledgeable and then we walked around. We stayed there for over 4 hours. We had lunch at the health café were the food was healthy and tasty and good and reasonably priced. We recommend it to all nature lovers. Butterflies pavilion is great too. Parking is free. Entrance is $18 for senior and $25 regulars"
Fast and Free way to get around Downtown Miami/Brickell,April 2019,50,Metromover,BarryL333,"The Metromover is convenient, fast and free, and I never seem to wait more than 5 minutes (9 am to 8 pm is my usual experience).  All of the stations I've been to have either escalators or an elevator or both.  A few of the elevators smell of urine at times so caution when entering (stairs/escalators avoid this!!!)"
Free and easy,April 2019,40,Metromover,JazboOttawa,"First time user, return trip. Worked perfectly. Never waited more than a few minutes. Bit crowded, but for a few stops, what the heck. And it's free."
Shop till you drop!,June 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,Dubaionmylist,Here you can find almost anything you want that a mall can offer.  You can also have dessert and coffee. You can dine or entertain your children. It is a nice place to have an outing as a family.
Every store you could ever want,June 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,tonichadviolet,We did not have much time to spend here before our flight out but this is a great mall. Every store you could ever want with what looks to be great resturants as well. This place is huge. There are also some outlet stores as well. Great way to spend a rainy day or if you love to shop this is the place to be. 
Shopping,April 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,Alfonso M,Excellent location to buy good merchandise at very reasonable prices. And a large variety of places to eat.
Shopping,July 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,YVP3,A good place to go shopping not too expensive in some everything in here is a good quality a known trade marks
Awesome experience,March 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,Marina M,I've never been to such a big mall so I only covered 75% of the ground floor as I only had four hours. Wonderful options. Didn't know that there were so many Spanish speaking persons living in Miami. Most of the store personnel were Spanish speaking....that was awesome! I would definitely visit again to cover the rest of the mall.
Party of 12,November 2018,50,Espanola Way,Linda H,We ate at Tapas and Tintos twice! Very friendly staff. Fun people. The Seafood and Meat Paella!!! Oh and the Sangria!
Nice for dining,August 2018,50,Espanola Way,Leisho,"It´s a nice change from the noise on busier streets like Lincoln Rd. or Ocean dr., this pedestrian street full of restaurants is a good alternative if you don´t want to listen to the traffic. Some recepcionists are a bit annoying whilst trying to convince you to choose theire place, and prices are maybe a bit high but i recommend it anyway."
Great place for dinner,September 2018,50,Espanola Way,saphirasstory,"Española Way is a small street with quite some lovely and good restaurants. It looks very nice in the evenings with all the lights and the music, and the few restaurants I have been at served great food!"
High level shopping,May 2018,50,Miami Design District,Tica S,"Love the shops around this place, if you have the chance to be there on friday night, you will be so lucky to have great live music.  The food? try Estefan Kitchen, love it"
Nice High-End Shopping Experience,July 2018,50,Miami Design District,juliegI6249SD,"If you are looking for beautiful merchandise, this is the place to be.  Everything is available from clothing to art to lighting, flooring and furniture.  "
Miami Design District,August 2017,40,Miami Design District,MatsSamaras,"//Mats Samaras, Stockholm, Sweden"
Great Find!,June 2018,40,Miami Design District,lmhoffman999,Found this District by accident and fell in love with it. Great shops and places to eat. Great afternoon walk around.
Loved it!,February 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,angelika55,"I went there on a Saturday afternoon and I was so glad I did. Took a little while to find since there is construction going on but you just look at a map or ask people. Again by bus, bus drivers if English speaking are helpful! Park is beautiful, Koi -fishes- ponds, plants and a very sweet man in the gift shop. Overall I loved it! "
A GEM in a small space - and FREE,February 2018,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,bginct,"Wonderful short break into an informative oasis with friendly staff.  Perfect for a short, calming, break from everything else in South Beach. While you do hear construction noise in the background it does not drown out the sounds of nature that call the gardens home.  The staff that mingle around a helpful, as is the free audio tour you can take by calling on your cell, the number listed on each info plaque.  There is a ton of great seating throughout the garden to sit and enjoy the space.  Our only regret is that we didn't bring good books to stay a while longer in this peaceful oasis.  The garden is well designed, fitting in a huge number of different plant examples and creating many different gardens that feel separate but flow flawlessly together."
Spoilt by noisy construction work,February 2018,30,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,835jenny,"Garden is quite small, but well laid out and tended. Lots of interesting plants and beautiful butterflies . Unfortunately there is a major construction of the massive new convention centre going on right alongside which was very noisy and spoilt what should have been a tranquil spot."
A good work- in- progress.,February 2018,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,mrsagf,"A brilliant conversion in 2011 from a humdrum city park into a botanical garden. Has a great future when more interpretive signage and more unusual plantings are added, and when the massive construction job next door is completed. Will certainly benefit urban workers/dwellers but may not be worth a trip from the beach, due to small size (2.6 acres). Congratulations to the visionaries and volunteers involved here."
Really fun strip!,March 2019,40,Little Havana,Judy L,"Everything else you've probably read about Little Havana is true. The blocks bet. 13 and 17 ave are the core and if you go slow you get to see some authentic culture, great ice cream, nice galleries. We also detoured to Wynwood to take in some more art galleries, but tourists beware. Not only are many of them closed (some moving to Little Haiti), we found this to be the case throughout Miami beach - galleries show up as ""Open Now"" online, but are not. Call ahead. Back to Little Havana - if I had had more time, I'd have spent the day asking the guys in the parks to teach me dominos! "
Miami Culinary Tours,March 2019,50,Little Havana,Marsha F,Had a great tour with Robyn. Very informative and fun. She added a lot of personal touches. Best part was the BAll and Chain bar.
Nice to see,January 2019,40,Little Havana,erik702,"This is a place you have to see when you visit Miami.      It is not that big as some people say but you have to enjoy the ""Havana"" atmosphere when you pass by the local bars and listen to their music.  "
A happening,March 2019,40,Little Havana,AndreaUbok,"Lot's of tourists & locals fill the streets of this trendy neighborhood.  Colorful people & colorful shops we feel as though we have left Florida for a time.  Good salsa music & dancing, delicious Cuban food & happy hour drink specials make Little Havana a real happening.  There is street metered parking, the tourist bus passes through as does the trolly.  .  We get start walking west along 8th street from Domino Park."
very good way to get to cruise port,April 2018,50,Miami Trolley,john m,We walked 2 blocks to the trolley from the hotel and caught the free trolley to the cruise port.  The ship was only a 4 minute walk from the trolley.
Fantastic free bus service,September 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Alan S,I would highly recommend using this service when staying on South Beach Miami.
ANOTHER EXCELLENT WAY OF TRANSPORTATION IN MIAMI,October 2017,50,Miami Trolley,Carlos C,"If you want to reduce your walking time, the Trolley is a good solution, and free. Now you can move not only within down town but several blocks out of down town.You can also combine the Trolley with the Metro as most of the Trolley has stops in most of the metro stations. Besides, the chauffeurs are very nice people !!! "
Excellent way to travel,September 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Gowermoo,Free regular travel covering all of Miami Beach. Well informed drivers and many pick up spots. Three separate routes 
A Must for Britto fans,January 2016,50,Britto Central,jcisinthehouse,"This gallery is beautiful, there are pieces you won't find somewhere else. Britto is an icon in modern art and this is the place where you have to buy stuff, everywhere else is more expensive."
Great little art shop,January 2016,50,Britto Central,abtisam1,"I love Britto, but it's too expensive for me. This shop/museum was open to walk through and see all the brightly colored artwork. I didn't buy anything, but it was fun to look. Not sure Id' bring small children in here, since the pieces are so expensive. "
Cool stuff,January 2016,50,Britto Central,Akma4,"Fun colorful paintings, prints and sculpture. Reminds me of Peter Max. Great gallery to educate the young kids. A must to see while shopping on Lincoln Rd"
Britto Art Gallery,January 2016,50,Britto Central,MissERM,"If you like bright colors and creativity, you will LOVE Britto Central!  They have some of the best talented sales professionals who will guide you through the gallery and tell you the history behind each piece of art. They are very friendly and informative about everything in the gallery. Whether you are in the market to purchase a piece of art or just want to browse around and enjoy the beautiful artwork, you will definitely enjoy your visit!"
It's a perfect beach for family and friends,April 2014,50,Bal Harbour Beach,BostonHarbor,"This is not South Beach.   It is not a ""beautiful people"" beach. It is for normal people.  It is absolutely gorgeous with a fabulous walking path and great sand and palm trees."
Still beautiful,November 2013,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Marcella D,"Bal Harbour is still a beautiful place to visit.  The beach, the shops, the restaurants.  yet take note, it is not for the budget concious.  Nothing in or around the Bal Harbour area will be inexpensive."
Perfect Miami beach for chilling,July 2014,40,Bal Harbour Beach,glymaa,"Tropical stretches of beautiful sandy beach, palm trees and water perfect for swimming..especially midweek. Families on the weekends but still able to find quiet spots...can walk for miles along the shoreline. At the northernmost tip of the island of Miami Beach, well worth spending a low key afternoon swimming.  On weekends lots of boaters partying offshore especially on the Intracoastal side of Haulover Beach, just north and visible from Bal Harbour beach. Don't miss the views from the fishing pier very popular with locals.  Lifeguards but no food concessions and limited inconvenient toilet facilities..so plan accordingly. Parking can also be scarce on weekends. If you are looking for South Beach buzz and hype, this is NOT for you."
"butler on the beach - oh, YES!",June 2014,50,Bal Harbour Beach,robert_dc,...and than butler has adjusted our umbrellas so we can continue enjoying the shade...................................................................................................
AWESOME Museum,December 2017,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,vipir2985,"I took my mother and he history of thus museum us amazing. The man who housed his art collection here, and the art from past history is. A must See!!! Cheap entertainment. Friday evening was free."
brilliant. A lovely surprise,January 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Oliverjulian,Everything worked here. The building is a delight and the price of entry reasonable. The permanent collection was full of fascinating items and the special exhibition of Julius Klinger posters a delight and a revelation. He died in a concentration camp- a great talent snuffed out. The scale is quite modest but the quality makes up for it. Go.
Exceptional ,January 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,MrDHorsham,I’m don’t have a huge attention span. This had me from start to finish gripped into the story. From floor to floor each exhibit had clearly been carefully curated to tell a story. A powerful and compelling story that no matter your age you’ll be able to connect to. Great way to spend an hour or two whilst here in Miami.
Superb collection for design buffs,January 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,PhilippeM10,"In the heart of the Art Deco district, this museum offers a trip in the machine age. Comprehensive and not too long, you will see design icons such as the Bluebird radio. Temporary exibits are also very well presented. We saw one about a important designer Julius Linger, impressive. A must for design lovers!"
Very Interesting Place to visit,May 2018,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,TathyK123,I recommend paying attention to the route because it's not easy to find the place
Baby jaguar,October 2018,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,sheenak45,Unbelieveable!!! An amazing experience and the staff is so nice!! Got to meet hold and play with their new baby jaguar! Highly recommend 
Very nice ,October 2018,50,Tom's NFL,Tanya2808,Staff is very friendly and the service is fast.  
"Great food, super quick service",January 2019,50,Tom's NFL,Tina R,We brought our group of 8 here before boarding a plane to go home after a cruise. Our hotel desk clerk suggested it when I told him we were looking for a family friendly sports bar. We were not disappointed. The service was quick and prompt and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the mahi mahi fingers (appetizers) and hot wings. The atmosphere was laid back and friendly with lots of tv's as well as a pool table and games to keep the kids occupied while waiting for the food. The best part was how prompt and quickly the food came out. Very impressed and highly recommend.
Tacos and wings,January 2019,50,Tom's NFL,crgardner,"Stopped in here because it was within walking distance from our hotel. Great atmosphere, delicious food and drinks. Had the wings and tacos. No complaints with either. Would definitely go again. "
"Good food, terrible service",March 2019,30,Tom's NFL,Sandym19480428,The burgers and fries were very good but the service was terrible. Waited for over ten minutes for anyone to approach our table. Went to the bar to order drinks and that finally prompted someone to notice us. Would have left but only other options were McDonalds and IHOP.
Lunch the night before a cruise,June 2019,40,Tom's NFL,589arturol,Lunch was great. The wings were as advertised. We had a burger and it was very good. Enjoyed a local microbrew. Service was decent but nothing special. Food was well worth it. I would go back again 
Contemporary art from around the globe,December 2016,40,Art Basel,Jeffrey H,And some of it quite good.  Very civilized venue and well-attended.There is much to do and see and savor.
Art Basel Highlights Creativity,December 2016,50,Art Basel,925judithn,"Returning to Art Basel for the third year reminds me that art can be cutting edge, fun and eye opening. The best venues are Art Miami and Context in Midtown and Aqua in South Beach as well as Pulse. For neighborhood atmosphere , food and music Wynwood is the destination. Nighttime is an amazing time to feel the pulse of Art Basel in Wynwood. People watching brings a fashion parade. Coming back next year. Would not miss it!"
Everyone Complains And Still Everyone Goes,December 2016,40,Art Basel,William B,Just watch your wallet - it will suddenly be lighter due to that box they are preparing to ship your purchases home.
Handicapped Unfriendly!,December 2018,10,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,rricri,"I have given this event a 1, because a 0 was unavailable.  Although my nephew and I were eagerly anticipating seeing the Night Garden at Fairchild Gardens, we were greatly disappointed.  We went Thursday night, December 6, 2018.  I walk with a walker, and I found that the way the event was designed was totally unacceptable for the handicapped.  The event planners designed the walkway over grass that had holes in it.  It was impossible to see the holes because of the poor lighting, making it impossible to navigate with a walker.  We had to leave without seeing hardly anything of the Night Garden.  Please be advised that this event was not designed by Fairchild Gardens, even though it was held there.  Fairchild Gardens has plenty of walkways that are handicapped accessible, but Night Garden did not use these.  Exiting the Gardens was even difficult by car because of the horrible lighting."
Beautiful tropical garden,November 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Gwenn M,This garden covers many acres with winding paths through different plant collections. I always find a visit very relaxing.  Don't miss the grotto or the butterfly exhibit.
Save your money and go somewhere else.,December 2018,20,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,wanderlustjj18,"I was so excited to visit the Night Garden with my family, and we were all willing to pay the hefty price tag of $30/person expecting it to be a cool experience. It was not worth it. There was mud everywhere. It was packed (why reserve specific time slots online?). I feel terrible wasting $125 for my family and I and that’s the honest truth."
What an amazing collection of tropical plants!,December 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,SUE H,This was our first visit to these gardens and they were very nice.  Some of the plants are huge and when you stand next to them you think you are in a Sci-Fi movie!  There are paths with signage and a variety of plants and ponds to view.  Excellent photo opportunities.  We also attended their night time light show; very interesting.
Do not visit the night garden!,December 2018,10,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,S2000STEALTHBOX,"Also this event was advertised as as holiday event and it has nothing to do with the holidays.  No music, lights, Nothing. So don't go expecting any holiday festivities."
Trip from south beach Miami,July 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,SarahCF28,Great days shopping. Plenty of options for food. Great value in shops. Only about $30 in uber from south beach 
You would need the full day here.Plenty of shops.,June 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,Helen F,Yes was here recently and enjoyed the day.Plenty of bargains.Lots of restaurants.The zones in the mall are done by colour which is  quite simple to follow. .the bus runs from some of the hotels and it also goes from the airport.
Wow 😲,July 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,961Catherine182,"I was thrilled we went there as the previous day we went to Aventura Mall & we didn’t like it.  This is the kinda malls i like with lots of eatery & lots of factory outlets not to mention Burlington as well as Ross inside the mall. A lot of bargains, not sure whether it is  because of the 4th july sales or not. Worth going."
Mall lovers' dream,July 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,Vitarachel,"This is an awesome outlet mall.  It is full of people (I can't imagine what it's like during high season), and lively.  There are restaurants surrounding it, and a food court inside.  If you don't know, Spanish is the predominant language in Miami, and doubly (if that is possible) for this mall.  But everyone also speaks English.  I love malls and this one did not disappoint.  Clean, lively, and it felt safe."
Pleasant Surprise---Large Portions,January 2018,50,Tom's NFL,lockandgo,Decided to eat here as it was part of the Ramada hotel. Pub setting........with a nice menu and large portions of tasty food. Thumbs Up to this restaurant.
Good food and good service,January 2018,40,Tom's NFL,Worldly2013,"This venue is walking distance from Comfort Suites, they have food and alcohol at reasonable prices, so no need to pay expensive taxi fares unless you want to eat in a fancy restaurant."
Great Establishment ,March 2018,50,Tom's NFL,Saltangler,"You can't go wrong if your hungry or thirsty. The atmosphere is friendly with an incredible staff. Food is wonderful and filling. If you show up during the day ask for the barmaid Christine, great personality. A+++++ all the way. Stop on in you can't go wrong"
Great place to visit.,February 2018,50,Tom's NFL,paula_pregler,"We were staying at the Miami Springs Holiday Inn Express and decided to walk over for lunch and some drinks.   Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff and great food."
Drinks!,February 2018,40,Tom's NFL,tooters111,Good food and very nice selection of beers and cocktails. Located close enough to our hotel to walk so was perfect in food and location.
So cool!,April 2019,50,Metromover,Mnochaj,We loved taking the metromover. It's so easy to get around in the centre of Miami! I hope more cities gets inspired by this.
Fun and practical!,May 2019,50,Metromover,murielboiteau,"The brickel area is always congested with trafic, and it takes a long time to do a little distance. The metro mover is very practical and allow to enjoy the view of Miami with the sea and its architecture."
Easy and FREE Downtown Miami transportation,April 2019,50,Metromover,ValleyTiger,"Highly recommend the downtown Metromover service for easy and FREE trips from your downtown hotel. We visited Bayside Marketplace, Brickell, the Riverwalk, and you can even get to the airport if you connect to the Metrorail at Government station. Security was always present and the cars seemed well maintained and clean."
Stop and Go!,May 2019,30,Metromover,L5708EWlauras,"It is a great option in the downtown area since parking is always a problem. The only reason I give 3 Stars is because every time it stops, it takes too long... Other than that is a wonderful way to commute."
Free transport in central Miami,May 2019,50,Metromover,FTMDave,Easy-to-follow maps in every carriage & station.  The latter also show where to change to bus & train options.  Security guards in several stations.
Wonderful restaurants,May 2018,30,Espanola Way,MarilynKay16,"We enjoyed this area also.  Such a very different feel to this area compared to Ocean drive. Quieter during the day, but lively at night with it's many choice of restaurants. "
No big deal!,January 2019,30,Espanola Way,M3427FIwilliams,This is DEFINITELY NOT a “destination”. This is one section of a street that is quite picturesque but otherwise nothing special. There are lots of mediocre restaurants and tourist shops. If you are nearby you might as well stop here but would not go out of my way to visit.
Expensive,January 2019,10,Espanola Way,Samcaplen,The night life is good and is very buzzy but it’s very expensive. $19 for a glass of white wine! 3 of us ate here had 3 beers 2 wines and a coke plus 3 main meals and it came to $210!! Go just to see it but don’t eat it’s wayyyyyyy to expensive. The food is average as well it’s nothing special.
Great for dinner options ,January 2019,40,Espanola Way,refcon,"Come at night for the best time on this very small, but quaint street. I come here to have a nice Italian meal. Christmas time is nice with all the lights too"
Lively,January 2019,50,Espanola Way,Ghamzak,"We just passed by Espanola way around 10pm, and we really enjoyed the environment, especially the live music. "
Great Design Architecture~,August 2018,40,Miami Design District,袁 牧,"many beautiful buildings here and although we didn't shop here, looking around brands like Gucci, Hermes, Rick Owens and so on is really cool :)"
Good atmosphere,August 2017,40,Tom's NFL,ahuaslinda,Steak ok
Take out,April 2017,40,Tom's NFL,off_limit,Nice place for watching sports while you are not in the city. Food is really good. Especially it's spicy wings! I loved it.
Good food,May 2017,40,Tom's NFL,sandybZ8370VS,Nice dinner when we arrived in Miami.  We was seated right away. Nice servers.  Short walk from our hotel. Walking right next to traffic was eye opening but do-able. 
Sports night,June 2017,50,Tom's NFL,david g,Good bar plenty of ale to choose from good selection of food from the menu staff very helpful and quick to serve.
great chicken wings!,April 2017,50,Tom's NFL,SparklingRitz,"My husband and I, love the chicken wings at Tom's NFL. They also have a lot of beer and craft beer selections."
"ART, CONCERT AND FOOD",March 2018,50,Miami Design District,Mimi Q,"vibrant environment to enjoy excellent concerts and art exhibitions.  Specially Wynwood area with different artists and galleries , as well as, excellent restaurants."
Love this area of Miami,August 2018,50,Miami Design District,marcosquintero,Many nice restaurants and eateries through out the area.
Must must must,August 2018,50,Miami Design District,Shukile,"Celine is the best, then Hermès but the I tire neighborhood is a real blast! "
Newest part of MIAMI is a winner,May 2018,50,Miami Design District,nraskind,"The design district is Miami’s newest ‘neighborhood’ and not just for Gucci & Prada, MULTIPLE AWESOME food options all around and free Salsa  concerts weekends"
Unexpected highlight,April 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,jmechler14,"We wandered through the botanical gardens after brunch Sunday morning. The space is beautiful and well designed; very tranquil in the middle of an otherwise urban area.  The best part is free admission, definitely worth a walk through if you're in the area. "
Extraordinary!,April 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Alice B,Beautiful gardens! Well-kept! Nicely labeled! Interesting and unique varieties of species from all over the world. Gaylord in the gift shop is a gem! He knows EVERYTHING about the gardens and is so gracious and personable and fun and enthusiastic and knowledgable and generous with his time! Wish we could have taken a tour with him. Wonderful brochure/map to follow along. Lovely oasis in the busy city to spend a couple of hours on a glorious day! Will definitely return! And.......admission is FREE! Amazing!
Pretty but crowded!,July 2017,30,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,SouthernDreamsFromUT,"The wait was so long when we went... I recommend going early or on a weekday. It is very nice, but not as relaxing as it could have been."
A little piece of magic,April 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,DakotaRedCat,"A small, sweet, peaceful botantial gardens that is fairly near the convention center.    Lovely place to walk around for 1/2 hour and enjoy the tropical flora.  Or have a picnic. They host public events from time to time as well.  Check their website's on line calendar.  It is very near the Holocaust Memorial so it is easy to visit both together."
Wonderful place to enjoy nature and relax!,May 2018,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Mary N,Well kept with a much appreciated mix of shade and sun; Benches and seats are sprinkled throughout!  The garden is not large but the winding paths make it feel expansive. Partially hidden garden features lure you around the bend.  The newly added Pine Rockland Demo Garden was my favorite!  The restroom and drinking fountain were clean and centrally located within the garden.
Must go,March 2019,50,Little Havana,hojo15,"First time to this area of Miami, so glad I went. Place is hopping at night lots of action going on. Walk the streets and stop anywhere for food, drinks and music.  Good fun,!"
Have to go,February 2019,50,Little Havana,majellan03,Dominos Park - do it for 5 minutes or the afternoon.
Little Havana,April 2019,50,Little Havana,768petraa,Totally exceeded my expectations.  For some unknown reason I envisioned it to be run down and dirty and was pleasantly surprised in the beauty and its cleanliness.  Loved the street art in the area.
Great restaurant/bar within walking distance of the Sleep Inn.,January 2017,50,Tom's NFL,beneman3,"This restaurant is a little bit of a walk from the Sleep Inn, but we enjoyed it so much.  On Super Bowl Sunday it was packed so we ordered carry out and ate in the motel (6 of us).  The food was great, but we realized when we got back to the motel that they had forgotten one person's order, so back my husband went.  They were so apologetic, replaced the missing order with a fresh order, and did not charge for it because of the inconvenience. So both food and service were outstanding! "
A regular visitor,February 2017,50,Tom's NFL,frankculver,"Food, service, atmosphere are great!  Friendly people.  I will continue to make this a regular dinner and lunch place."
"great place, nice atmosphere",March 2017,40,Tom's NFL,Londra_11,"We went there a couple of times for a late bite as we stayed in an hotel close by. Staff is very nice and atmosphere is great. Can be a bit noisy in the front but much less noisy in a booth in the back. Food is simple and good , beer is chilly . What else do you need!"
Good food,March 2017,50,Tom's NFL,Maria K,We eat every day this time good food and good service  i love there onionsoup and clam chowder awesome chicken wings well i eat most on there menu delicious 
Dinner & Lunch,February 2017,50,Tom's NFL,Piglet810,Would recommend this place and would definitely go back when next in Miami
Great,April 2019,40,Little Havana,Brian D,If you have some extra time while visiting Miami I would suggest making a stop here. Some of the best coffee and food in South Florida. Get a Cuban coffee! You will not be disappointed. 
Loved it!,April 2019,50,Little Havana,Ammie L,We enjoyed visiting Little Havana and actually went back for a quick drop in to grab some souvenirs. We stopped in many of the coffee cigar shops. The food was great and the atmosphere was fun. Both trips we went were during the day. 
Free trolley rides around Miami Beach!,October 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Dacia D,"The trolley was great to take to other parts of Miami Beach, locals also use it for their transportation so it gets crowded but it's worth using."
Convenient,October 2018,40,Miami Trolley,Bob D,"There was a stop on both sides of the road at the hotel that we stayed at. We were able to take the trolley almost everywhere that we went. Some of the drivers drove a little erratic at times, but we always got where we needed to go - and the price is great! You can't beat free...."
Fantastic Free Service ,October 2018,50,Miami Trolley,SAB5859,"The trolleys could get quite full, but what a fantastic free service."
It's FREE!!!,October 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Eura B,This was SUCH a great find!  One of the staff persons at our hotel recommended that we visit Bayside Market and told us about the MetroMover shuttle!  How refreshing to find this cute little shuttle that offers multiple locations for pick up and dropff for FREE!  I come from a city/state where you have to pay for EVERYTHING!! this was great! Very quaint and just what we needed. 
Good people in this world ,October 2018,50,Miami Trolley,mikeyyyy66,Company 
Great artist-do visit.,February 2016,50,Britto Central,nebahat,"We found the Romero Britto gallery by accident, we were shown round as we really enjoyed his work. He also does pieces for cruise ships and I found gifts in the airport by him too."
love it !!,January 2016,50,Britto Central,Dayana m,"just love it ,I wanted to buy everything! colorful art perfect to decorate any room ,any office.i got a lot of souvenirs and accents for my office."
"Love Britto's work, Very Happy Themes",February 2016,50,Britto Central,JamesD007Travels,"Romero Britto has come a long way with his art. While some say it is commercial, I like the way it makes me feel. His subjects are lively, happy and upbeat. "
Garish empty nonsense,February 2016,10,Britto Central,Simon T,"This is not a gallery per se, just a bright and garish take on nothingness made shiny.  This does not even wink the Real Miami arts scene, not worth waking past."
Perfect for what we wanted,October 2016,50,Tom's NFL,Christopher W,"My wife was concerned about walking there from the hotel and said she would not walk it alone, but there were no issues and it was not a problem."
It is a local jewel,October 2016,50,Tom's NFL,b747sfe,"I went with my friend who has lived in MIA for 20 years and never before here, we both loved it, great food, lots of TV's, service could improve, servers spend a long time talking to the regulars, but in general it is very nice place, and not to forget, decent prices too."
Great place for Sunday football,November 2016,50,Tom's NFL,mohawk1129,while staying overnight in Miami
NFL Sunday ,December 2016,50,Tom's NFL,Ambitious3536,I use Ubereats for the time and I order from this place the Chicken Wings and Fries was the best and I will order again
Good But...,August 2016,30,Tom's NFL,Jessica V,"The restraunt is good with many tvs and entertainment but, the food was not so good and the service was decent."
We were there today and if you like Britto it is good,February 2016,30,Britto Central,Motherofchildren,"I am not a fan of his art although it is very interesting. For Britto fans, this would be heaven. If you are on Lincoln Road already, don't miss it. "
nice,August 2014,40,Bal Harbour Beach,sparkle l,"great weather and service, very clean and pretty a must go!! dont miss out we stayed at the st regis bal harbour that might have changed things "
Bal Harbour Beach,September 2014,40,Bal Harbour Beach,bob a,"Great Beach avoid oct and Nov as the Jelly Fish arrive, but clean and tidy with a nice pahtway along the beach for those early morning strolls"
Nice beach lots of sand,December 2014,40,Bal Harbour Beach,JohnPH62,"but the hotel pool is perfect for relaxing, eating and drinking."
Beautiful and clean!,December 2014,50,Bal Harbour Beach,eatarnaki,"Awesome beach.  We stayed at the Sea View on the ocean.  The hotel was ok (they are upgrading currently to go green).  But the property is amazing.  The beach is cleaned every morning.  I only saw one cigarette butt on the beach.  Very, very clean.  White sand.  Turquoise blue water.  Ahhh!"
"White sand, clear skies, blue ocean",April 2014,50,Bal Harbour Beach,523maggier,"There is Nothing not to like here. The staff will set up your chairs, an umbrella, and bring cocktails and food right to you. Lovely!!"
Fabulous Gem of a Museum,February 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Judith M H,This collection of art and objects was truly delightful.  We especially enjoyed the presentation of the poster art of Julius Klinger who lived mostly in Vienna and Berlin prior to WWII.
Loved it!,February 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Susan C,"What a fun evening! Took advantage of the free Friday evening (6-9pm). This included a guided tour of the permanent exhibit by Shoshanna, one of curators, who was informative without being preachy. A great evening!"
"Unique, historical, artistic",January 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Harvey B,You can walk or take the Miami Beach free Trolley to The Wolfsonian from almost any hotel in Miami Beach.
Always worth a visit,February 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,frequenttraveler504,"We return to the Wolfsonian annually when we visit Miami Beach.  The exhibits are engaging for viewers of all ages.  It's a remarkable collection.  We had the privilege of attending a presentation on a local architect, which was top rate.  The gift shop is filled with playful and sophisticated items for all ages.  Lots of fun."
Best day ever!,November 2018,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Nomad55388446627,"This was the best day in my entire life! I loved every single second of it! The tour was super cool and our tour guide gave us a lot of information on the animals and how they take care of them. The best part was the feline encounter and playing with the cutest tiger cubs ever!!! If I could rate this place 100/100 I would! I highly recommend the general wildlife experience and one of the animal encounters, it’s so worth it!"
We were treated like family,November 2018,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Janna H,My friend and I came while we were visiting Miami and had a fantastic time! Annabelle answered all of our questions and was very informative. We got to hear inside stories about the animals.  Mario is an incredible guy and runs a well-maintained facility where the animals are adored and cared for very well. We had an experience of a lifetime!
Great Airport Location,April 2016,40,Tom's NFL,marathonguy,If you find yourself having to stay at the airport in Miami give this place a try!
Lunch,April 2016,30,Tom's NFL,survalia,"Three blocks from Comfort Suites where I stayed, so I walked down for lunch and a beer.  Bar food, friendly staff."
A lot of Beer Choices and Decent Reasonable priced food near Airport Hotels,April 2016,40,Tom's NFL,Dennismc2015,"If you are staying at Days Inn North, Ramada, Clarion, or the Comfort Suites Airport, it is only a block or 2 walk. Don't settle for order in pizza if you have the time to visit this restaurant."
Food and a beer on an overnight stay,April 2016,30,Tom's NFL,TanednReady,Been to Tom's once a year for the past three years while passing though Mia. We stop by for a beer and some food. They have great beers to select from and some great specials. The food is OK but nothing to write home about. The burgers are really good. Had a chicken parm sandwich that was the strangest version I've ever ate. Never again on that one. They say their wings are favorites but they're not really that good to this phoenix guy. The beer selection is really good and not overpriced. The service can be slow. It was the last time we were there but it was packed with locals and travelers like us. 
Great Bar,May 2016,40,Tom's NFL,Chaos2106,Staying one night in Comfort Suites and decided to give this place a try.  Very close and the food was good - basic pub meals but very tasty and a reasonable price.  Service was good too.  Don't normally eat chicken wings but tried some there - wished I had ordered more.   House wine was $4.50 a glass and very drinkable. Good atmosphere.
awesome experience,October 2018,40,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Pascale O,"We barely stayed 2 minutes in the enclosure with the 2 sloths, we were not able to touch them as they were pretty aggressive as they were hungry and not fed yet by the person in charge. We paid a lot for nothing. it was the same as seeing then through the fence. I will go back but for a different animal ."
Customer service needs improvement.,December 2018,20,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Xiomara B,"The place is very well kept and the animals seem very well taken care of. You can see animals up close including lagers; tigers, lions etc.  however our experience was not up to par with the high cost of the experience. We paid close to 300 hundred dollars for our party of four for a total of one hour tour. We get there and the registration process is very disorganized. So much so that they delay our group and ask us to join a group that had already started 15 minutes prior. When I complained that I had missed a quarter of our tour due to no fault of our own, one of the office workers said we would have to come back another day to do a full tour. What kind of service is that. Luckily the nice young lady giving the tour decided to restart the tour for us and take us to see what we had missed.  Overall the experience felt rushed and the service was not up to par with the high price we paid."
Great Time for Art lovers!,December 2016,50,Art Basel,JessicaC8983,Great gathering of galleries from all over displaying immensely talented artists. Be prepared to walk a lot. The convention center is huge.
Must Attend for Collectors and Artists,December 2016,50,Art Basel,urbanroam,"Wonderful and diverse collections of art. Galleries from across the globe in attendance. Purchase, appreciate and feel inspired. I loved this event and will be back. A helpful tip: parking is a pain - use Uber."
it is better end better organised each year,December 2016,50,Art Basel,Crystal1942,this years opening was much less crowded than the previous year.the galleries are well chosen and you could walk around and see all the art very well
Get a one day pass with design miami access,December 2016,50,Art Basel,Jennifer L,Paid for a weekend pass but really only needed a day pass. I was able to do the convention center and design miami in one day.
Inspiring Arts Festival,December 2016,40,Art Basel,izuj,Art Basel was a delight!! Came the last few days and wasn't overcrowded. There was plenty to see and I even had the chance to visit Design Miami. Wonderful even with tremendous variety. 
Awesome food and cheap prices!,December 2015,50,Tom's NFL,Brunettebabe_37,"We stayed at a nearby hotel and there isn't alot in that areaso we stumbled into this sports bar, def not a five star area or place and I found it chilly inside but its your basic sports bar with great food and cheap drinks, what more can you ask for!  Prob the nicest place in that area lol.  We ended up eating there twice and both times had exceptional food!  My compliments to the cooks I was very impressed!"
Mr M had a decent meal,January 2016,30,Tom's NFL,wjm8309,I ordered the cobb salad which was a large salad and my wife ordered the skirt steak.  She enjoyed her steak and my salad was okay.  I would go back but order something different.
Food was ok,January 2016,30,Tom's NFL,Germain G,"ended up at Tom's after ordering pizza and never receiving it after a 2 1/2 hour wait. Food was ok, service was slow even if the place was not full. we were told prior to ordering that it would be slow, but customer that arrived over an hour after we did got their food before we did. Price of beer made up for the wait. Would try the place again"
Nice sports bar,February 2016,40,Tom's NFL,GrammySims,Nice clean sports bar. Good food. Recommend. Lots of tv's. Only had drinks but food others ordered looked good. Will go back.
Top 10 Sports Bar in Miami,February 2016,50,Tom's NFL,racerx3,"When I travel I always go here. Great Food, Fantastic service and TV's galore with every sport I need. MUST SEE !!"
Good food,April 2015,50,Tom's NFL,slw880,Short walking distance from Miami International North Comfort Suites hotel. Food was very good for a sports bar. Decent enough menu for being the type of place it was. Large portions. Numerous television screens displaying a variety of sports.
Great food and bar scene,April 2015,50,Tom's NFL,Frenchy55McKinney,Liked food a lot!! Onion soup excellent. Fresh salads. Good boiled shrimp and the typical black beans and rice completed my meal. One waiter was surly. Must have been tired. Rest of staff accomodating. Locals hang out there in numbers.
GREAT SPOT TO EAT!!!!,July 2015,40,Tom's NFL,Shree P,This restaurant / sports bar is two blocks down from the Comfort Suites Miami (where we stayed).  The food was great for a sports bar...and they have a wide variety to choose from including bar-be-que ribs!!!
Nice Pub,July 2015,40,Tom's NFL,Boschie,Lots of beer on tap and nice menu for snacks and meals. I can imagine it be a big party place on sporting days.
"""Great place""",July 2015,50,Tom's NFL,Dennis S,"Try it, you can't miss with this place."
"Beautiful setting, plants, and butterfly garden",November 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,336gailt,"We arrived in time for a little tram tour of the grounds, with the guide pointing out interesting plants, including the fact that there are 2,000 species of palms in the world. We saw a big alligator resting on one of the lake shores and really enjoyed the lovely butterflies in their garden. There were many dedicated and knowledgeable volunteers who answered lots of questions. The isit gave us a greater appreciation of botanical gardens."
OMG,August 2014,10,Tom's NFL,donnabN828BV,This place is horrible!!!!! We waited over and hour for wings and when they came out they were cold. The manager never came out to apologize and they brought the food out cold!!!! I have not had service this bad in a LONG time! I would never comes here again. I should have known when you pull up to a sports bar on a Saturday night and the game is on and there is NOBODY there. Smh! I hope this helps somebody before they go through this.....
Good food with excellent service,November 2014,40,Tom's NFL,dinek,"Walked here from nearby hotel. Friendly and excellent service. Many people there and all were enjoying the ambiance and good food. Reasonable prices, too."
Nice bar and grill,December 2014,40,Tom's NFL,Chelsea S,We walked here from a nearby hotel and took a chance that it would be a good place for dinner--and it most definitely was! We ordered wings for an appetizer and were very satisfied with them. My husband had a burger and I had pasta. Service was friendly and would recommend.
you call that food?,February 2015,10,Tom's NFL,colkowalski,"Terrible food, warm, weak drinks. RUDE inexperienced staff! Dirty bathroom. Tuna melt consisted of toasted bread, cold cheese and cold tuna.  $9.00 for a strawberry drink that was raspberry, warm and contained very little alcohol"
great place.,January 2015,40,Tom's NFL,coolrman33,"this place had great food and atmosphere. fast service, really friendly. they had a really nice selection also."
Terrible,December 2018,10,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,183rossc,This is one of the worst things I’ve ever done in my life. I go every year to look at Christmas lights. There wasn’t even any lights. We weren’t proud. There were huge lines. It wasn’t worth the wait or the money. 
Night Garden is not good,December 2018,20,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,ryanctrips,"The park was a very nice and pretty environment. The Night Garden was not something we enjoyed. Firstly, one of the staff members said out loud that they have over 1,000 people coming at the time. There were SO many people, and the staff didn’t do that good of a job managing the tons of people. Staff were advising us not to go on one of the main exhibits until later because of too many people clogging it. Why? That’s really not right. The staff were unable to create a single file line of everyone who wanted to go on this attraction. When entering the beginning of Night Garden, you see small Christmas-flower-lights on the ground. When walking in, of course they were pretty, but we expected much more. We assumed that what we were seeing was just the introduction and barely part of the whole thing. It ended up being the best thing we saw all evening. There were very few Christmas lights, and for the most part, the ones there were you could see driving from house to house in neighborhoods without paying so much money. It was insanely overpriced for what you are getting. One of the exhibits was literally large sculptures of dandelions. "
Beautiful South Florida day in lush gardens and surrounded flittering butterflies,December 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,agnesr924,"Now with teenagers and no tram ride we were still impressed with the beautiful gardens, the scenic water/lake views, Chihuly art, sculptures, the cafe food selection and especially the butterfly garden. Exciting for all ages. We saw a hummingbird inside the butterfly enclosure and a crocodile in ther lake."
16 of us had a magical night at Night Garden,December 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Ramblingwelove,"This review is for the Night Garden event. I love Fairchild.  I googled “family friendly New Years Eve” and happened upon The Night Garden. We bought 16 tickets and then I saw negative reviews and was nervous. This was one of the best NYE events we have attended in a long time. The garden was lit up, there were fairies, talking rocks, a talking tree, snow, DJ and fireworks. We loved it. I had read people who had concerns about accessibility but I saw 6 or 7 people in wheelchairs and they were able to get around the entire event. We each had small flashlights to help with dark corners but didn’t have any trouble navigating even with a stroller.  The food truck prices were a little steep but for $15 my Spain burger included fries and was DELICIOUS.  There were adult beverages. Plenty to see and my 2 y.o. granddaughter and the other kids enjoyed themselves. At the end of the night one of our group lost his keys but Steve, Tito, Andrew and Kevin stayed with us until they were found. True gentleman and a great event. So happy I didn’t let the negative reviews scare us away. "
Dolphin Mall,July 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,LexiluringTestar,"You can compare this Mall to sawgrass mills, got the same feeling when I visited this place. Huge place with all the shops you could wish for, also offers a good foodcourt and The cheesecake factory!"
Lots of things to do and lots to see,July 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,Vacationer664725,It was nice to have outlet malls with really affordable prices in addition to the other shopping options. Really big mall that offers a lot of facilities including a locker which was really  effective due to the amount of bags ....but one downside is the amount of people who drag you over to their kiosk and try to get you to  buy something...but other than that it has a lot of different food options and overall is a good place to shop
WEEKEND GETAWAY,July 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,E6894WHjamess,One of the most beautiful malls in Florida.There are lots of stores to visit and shop at and it's in a good location. 
"Best ,most varied mall",July 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,jdiaz1791,"In the center of Doral, a city within Miami-dade, is this mall, right off the Turnpike exit NW 12 St . Many top restaurants: Cheesecake factory, Texas de Brazil, PF Changs and several small , many flagships stores : Ross, Marshalls, Nike, Newman Marcus, Bloomingdales, Calvin Klein, Burlington , etc as well as many kiosks. You will find what you are looking for. There’s also a state of the art Bowling alley and top rated Movie theater . Valet parking, taxi station as well. There are 8 entrances into the mall from the parking lots and a hotel conveniently located about 300 feet, Courtyard Marriott ."
Slow but Useful ,May 2019,50,Metromover,kbriss,Great way to get Down Town and to the Financial District.
It is nice and free,May 2019,40,Metromover,Tatiana K,"It is nice and free, you may also go to your destinations around the city. Clean and pleasant, operating all day!"
Great way to go,June 2019,40,Metromover,gearoidg2014,Once you figure out which of the three systems u need to be on a great way to get around and it’s free Mr Trump Kuantan’s have heard about that part of the deal given that it operates on 3 Louis it can confuse you when u get back in the ground
Hopping Place,December 2013,30,Tom's NFL,songdog50,"Good chicken wings & nachos. Waitress was polite & accommodating. Service was prompt ,wait for food was not long.  Loud & noisy, but that's what you expect at a Sports Bar."
It´s free!,April 2019,50,Metromover,Alohanuiloa,"I used MetroMover for the first time. It is very convenient and it has 2 routes, For me it was really nice as one of the stations is 2 blocks from my hotel and the Bayside Mall."
nice option for moving around in the tourist area,June 2019,40,Metromover,GSTraveller200,We used this service almost exclusively during a recent trip to Miami.  The connection between our hotel in Brickell and the tourist area in downtown was a snap.  The train also has a stop at the Brickell Center Mall which is really great as well.
Utterly charming,February 2019,50,Espanola Way,btslover2,"Charming street down in South Beach which is geared for pedestrians with shops, cafes and restaurants. At night it is lit lovely. "
"short, picturesque pedestrian street",February 2019,30,Espanola Way,svale87,Lined with restaurants and shops.  Paved in cobblestones.  No cars. A pleasant place to stroll or to have a meal.
House of Paella one of my favorite restaurants here,February 2019,50,Espanola Way,Renee A,"Pedestrian mall similar to Lincoln Street mall, lined with restaurants and retail shops. House of Paella is basically at the end and had outstanding sangria and salad with peeled shrimp. They also put on a free flamenco demo (2 women) on the street. Great entertainment and food."
Side alley,January 2019,40,Espanola Way,MostafaA424,A pedestian side stree between 15-14 streets from Collins to Washington it is nice it has a lot of restaurants manly Cuban Italian and Spanish it is good for breakfast brunch lunch and dinner
"Lovely little stroll w outdoor cafes, Spanish theme",February 2019,40,Espanola Way,Echo T,It’s just one little block but it’s a lovely departure from bustling Washington Avenue that features a few quaint shops and Latin eateries w outdoor seating. It’s fairly lively on weekends yet not like Ocean Drive lively so it’s a bit more relaxing. 
One of my favorittes,October 2017,50,Miami Design District,M1_guan,One   my favorite spots in  Miami an ideal escape from the busy ad crazy miami city. one of the best moments of my stay
My creative side come alive!,September 2018,50,Miami Design District,Trek601963,"I love the design district, so many interesting things to see and explore! Visiting here always brings out my creative side!"
The need more lounging and shaded areas,September 2018,30,Miami Design District,Z9866ZHnancyl,"The Design District has gone through a metamorphosis. Almost every luxury brand of the LVMH group is here, the buildings have been architecturally transformed and are beautiful But the shopping at the Bal Harbour Shoppes still feels more luxurious even tho they have taken many of the boutiques from that location. Its a lot of concrete but there needs to be more green space, sitting space some large fountains with sitting and relaxing. Honestly its a bunch of luxury boutiques. Every luxury watch manufacturer except if you want the best selection of Richard Mille you need to go to Brickell City Center and ask for Alanna. She is truly the best. Its a good place to visit and the new La Roch from New Orleans is fun, but again the food at Casa Tua is better. "
High end mall in beautiful Miami,September 2018,40,Miami Design District,SunSandStyleSports,I popped in here to look around and they have every high-end designer you can think of. The shopping area has lots of valet and also self serve parking. 
Great reno of a formerly-abandoned area,August 2018,40,Miami Design District,ResidentePermanente,Not an easy place to shop. Better to know what you want and where you're going. It's more like a village of stores than a shopping mall. It still feels like it's in the process of development as many spaces are yet to be occupied. Everything from Hermes to lesser-known brands and individually-owned design/concept stores. We had the names and locations of the places on our must-see list and then enjoyed discovering other interesting vendors. When it's hot or raining it would not be a comfortable ahopping trip as all businesses are accessed from the open streetscapes. Congrats on the urban redevelopment and the revitalization of a depressed neighborhood. 
Beautiful Place to hid from heat,June 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,patiprego1,"If you love plants, you will love this place. At first we didn t see the place because the convention center is being repaired and hids it but our wonderful guide from our antique car city tour told us about it. We were very thankful because this is a beautiful park with tons of plants you do not see so commonly. I guess the great weather in Miami favors plants that we do not see in Europe. Must Do!!!!"
Paradise,June 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,W8665QVjohnh,Very pleasant way to kill an hours or so. Many beautiful plants and ponds. Our favorite was the bee hive in the gazebo copula.
beautiful!!!,June 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,lalocadr19,"This place is beautiful,  for a person that love plant, flowers and just a time to relax and enjoy a peaceful time in a gardens. Gardens has couple of statues, and artifacts which are beautiful to see. Have to paid for parking meters, no fee to use or entrance."
Visit! Paradise with lots of unique features,June 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,CommuterFood,Do visit. It's right next to the Holocaust Memorial as well. 
Beautiful  shadow oasis inside the hot city,July 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Svitlana88,Love it from the first visit!
Little Havana,June 2018,40,Little Havana,Travelexpt,"Visit for a taste of old and young Havana culture in the heart of Miami. These 10 city streets are filled with cafes, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, very festive atmosphere specially at night fridays/Saturday. Some cigars stores have cigars making demostrasion. If you like flamenco dancing check out casa panza. There are also a few Cuban cultures art stores and exsevision."
Nice to see if you have the time,April 2019,30,Little Havana,861solotraveler,Nice to see but not a must see on a short trip. Enjoyed watching Cuban cigars being rolled and strolling down the street and hearing live music being played in the cafes. Souvenirs are mostly not handmade nor native Cuban so slightly disappointed. Not a large area so can definitely see walk and go.
well worth the trip,April 2019,50,Little Havana,Dave S,We spent 4 hours on a food tour of Little Havana. I recommend doing a guided tour to learn about everything and then come back a second time and enjoy the area. A must see is the ball and chain bar. They play music all day and all night.  Lots of history and also go to Domino park. If you cannot go to Cuba this is a place to get the feel of the people.
Food Havana feel recreated ,May 2019,40,Little Havana,StephenCr0ss,It’s quite authentic as the people are real and live here and try to recreate a slice of home. Good fun. 
Dont expect much,April 2019,30,Little Havana,imdarkside,"This is more of an ""area"" of the City rather than a contiguous neighborhood.  Similar to NOLITA in NYC dont expect much.  You will not really even know you are in the area unless you happen see that on a map.  Now actual Havana is another story completely.  Ignore this area in Miami and go to Habana instead."
Free,November 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Shelley R,"Great way to get around, free ride, sometimes very crowded.  Wait time vary between rides, but rides are quick.  Use the app to calculate times of trollies."
Wonderful!,November 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Amanda S,"We just arrived off a cruise ship and couldn't find the trolley stop...looked for ever, getting hot and bothered. Then, saw a trolley just coming along, no where near the stop and the man who helps you cross the road stopped the trolley for us and we were able to get on...in the middle of the cruise area ! How lovely was that. Brilliant!"
Great way to get around,November 2018,50,Miami Trolley,deltadawn103,"What a great way to get around the city and its free!  We only waited a few minutes for a tram.  We were originally going to take a taxi back to our hotel but then saw this free tram, can’t beat that!"
Great free way to get around,November 2018,50,Miami Trolley,TropicalLover,"We were in Coconut Grove without a car. Used the trolley several times to get around town. Then used the Brickell line to make a connection with the Little Havana route to spend the day touring there. Great, free, service. Not a long wait between trolleys. Clean and air conditioned. Most drivers didn’t know a lot of English, but were helpful with information about the routes."
Free ride,December 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Mikethepipes,"Also there are trolley just for the south beach loop, middle loop and the north beach loop."
cute little gallery,March 2016,40,Britto Central,ShellPR,"We stopped in the gallery because a friend had raved about it.  It was interesting to see so many Britto pieces, because I really knew very little about his work.  The staff seemed more helpful and friendly than I was expecting based on other reviews.  The line of Britta-themed Disney characters really caught my son's eye.  Although we didn't make a purchase, I'm glad we stopped in to see what all the fuss was about."
Love it!!!!,March 2016,50,Britto Central,Ragerdy,Excellent selection - fun and inviting ..... always makes you smile. Great place to find gifts to take home.
Unique but of course Expensive!,September 2015,50,Britto Central,Alejandra D,It is a good store that is well located for window shopping.
An Art Shop,May 2016,30,Britto Central,Janetchisholm,We looked at the art...lots of paintings for sale but a very distinctive art that is not my style.  Kids seem to love it.
Free expo and a must see,May 2016,50,Britto Central,PeruTrav,"I really enjoy to visit the exposition of Britto, it is open from 9 to 8pm (but double check the open hours)."
Wonderfully clean beach,February 2015,40,Bal Harbour Beach,Norwaykek,The beach is clean and well kept. Several restaurants within walking distance. Great walking paths. Would love to go back. 
Nice Boardwalk,February 2015,30,Bal Harbour Beach,M C,"Not much of a beach, but a very nice boardwalk from the St. Regis (at 96th) south beyond what will be the new home of the Four Seasons. One path for pets, and another pet free parallel path. Enjoy. "
Beautiful Beach,March 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Andrea H,"The beach is very close to the hotel, with in waking distance if you are health. You will see beautiful views in your way there and also little charming shops."
Family Trip to St. Regis,March 2015,40,Bal Harbour Beach,Philly1112,The hotel staff was not helpful at all. They did not do anything to make you feel like you or your family were special. The pool staff was amazing. 
Best museum in town,March 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,ronald k,"This is a fascinating place if you like art deco.  I haven't been to the art deco museum on Ocean Drive at the tourist center, but it didn't look that interesting.  This is the real thing, a great museum; come on a rainy day.   "
Magnificent Collection of Art Deco Objects!,March 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,eventsbythirteen,"This Museum, is one of the most comprehensive collections of art deco, in Miami, or elsewhere! Located in a former Bekins Storage building, the ambiance is set! A South Beach Must- See!!"
PRETTY COOL ART,May 2017,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,VP315,"Came here with a college class and the art and sculptures were pretty cool! The tour was awesome and informative, they had a collection with art of old political campaigns and that was interesting! Check it out to do something different!"
Small but very interesting.,February 2018,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,trave16ear,"I was not expecting too much as I thought this was a propaganda museum - which it is, but not in your face.  It makes you think about what propaganda was at the time and how they got their message across.  All posters were very well thought out and artistic.  Very nicely done.  (The security people do not seem to be overly interested though.)  Nice quiet change from the beach and restaurant scene."
Magnificent WOW,April 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,jros1513,For anyone who appreciates art in all of its form. It is worth the visit and the have a very nice sundry shop and cafeteria with great gifts and literature. Free admission included in the resort fee of the hotel we stayed at.
Speaking of luzury living and service!!!,January 2015,50,Fisher Island,OscariniT,"As a realtor I would highly recommend to purchase a home here either a condo or one of a villa. Golf course, tennis, SPA, schools , 5 restaurants, grocery store to name a few of their true luxury amenities. You cant describe the security work managed! Well done! If it is in your price range , definitely a must to own. There is a ferry that connects you with Miami , it runs every 15 min , well organized!"
"Not something ""to do"" in Miami unless you  live there,  are staying at hotel or are a guest. Is not tourist attraction",April 2015,50,Fisher Island,Mark H,"Lovely quiet  lush island  just off South Beach - access by ferry. Worth a visit  if invited! Good beach bar, several private beaches, decent golf course, good  3 mile walk all around the  island."
Interesting!,April 2015,50,Fisher Island,petraalmutawa,It can be reached only by boot or helicopter and only the rich and famous live there.
Rich,April 2015,50,Fisher Island,debbief530,All the rich and famous live here. It was nice to see from the boat tour. Worth a visit and the sunshine us of course glorious!
one of Miami's island,January 2015,30,Fisher Island,sipivu,"You need to take the ferry to go there. There are a few buildings and houses. It is not really interesting, except if you want to see where a few personalities have lived."
"Money, Money, Money",January 2019,20,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Peter C,I honestly think all they care out is the money. Booked a 2 hour tour. We were rushed through in under a hour. The animals are beautiful but all they seem to care about is how many people they can push through there in a day. I had emailed them three times about it with no response. It's really unfortunate because I was really looking forward to a great time.
"Personalized, educational once in a lifetime experience",January 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,TheOOOBlog,"If I lived closer I would 100% come back to do this experience multiple times, and if I had the money I would 1000% do the personalized tour instead of the group one!"
There is nothing for you to do if you arrive early and other caveats,January 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,bnbdigs2,"Overall we had a wonderful experience, with some caveats. We made the mistake of arriving an hour before our reservation thinking we could walk around or amuse ourselves in some way prior to the scheduled tour.  Unfortunately, we were told we could not walk around unaccompanied, so had to look at walls for an hour.  I also thought I had purchased a wildlife encounter with big cats via Groupon but learned that all interactive tours are separate from the two hour general tour.  Still, I was thrilled when we made it to the animal interation area where we handled reptiles, a hedhog and let a couple of small monkeys climb on us. The animals are in rather small cages so it was easy to see them up close. An otter even played with me by throwing a shrimp my way.  I threw it back to her and she tossed it back.  Then the otter gave up when I threw it back again, probably thinking I was too dumb of an animal not to want to eat the delicious shrimp she was trying to share. LOL."
TRIP TO THE ZOO,January 2019,30,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,JML14369,An amazing experience to be so close to the animals - BUT extraordinarily expensive for such a short time and not be able to pet
Special Wildlife Encounter,February 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,swakefield3,"Absolutely amazing experience! The staff was very personable and put their best effort into making these encounters special and worth the money. They were very good with handling the animals, and you could definitely see that the animals are very loved and well taken care of. We did the special wildlife encounter, where we were able to hold and play with a variety of animals, including snakes, primates, anteaters, owls, baby chimpanzees, feline cubs, etc. It was an experience my family and I will never forget and I definitely recommend!"
This was AMAZING!  Can't say enough good about the selection of Art,December 2016,50,Art Basel,Madamtt33,"We ended up in Miami and did not know about Art Basel until we got there.  This was such a great event- there was so very much to see and so much to do.  We walked and looked and loved for about 12 hours straight.  The art blew our minds- from high end art, to street art, the old cars to Music.  I would recommend this event to anyone who loves culture!"
Beautiful Art Work From Around The World,December 2016,50,Art Basel,onreafarrar,This was the highlight of our family vacation. I wanted to take my kids to see something new a break away from the usual and 8 hours later after walking around and seeing all the beautiful displays we all had a great time. Very family friendly and we liked that we were able to be so close up to these wonderful pieces of art.
Must See for Modern Art Lover,December 2016,40,Art Basel,SunshineLadybird,I am not a modern art lover but I did enjoy this show.  It was much larger than I expected.  There were some interesting exhibits like the spagetti room and live performance art walking around.  We saw no price tags so I assume if you have to ask that one can assume you can't afford the piece.  We were fortunate enough to have VIP tickets so we got it quickly and enjoyed the amenities of a VIP lounge and outdoor garden when we needed a break.  
worldwide,November 2016,50,Art Basel,Robert M,this is a world renowned festival.  i usually do the design district annex because traffic is heavy during the event. you'll see famous art by famous artists and probably some famous people too.
Art Basel week is one big excuse for parties,December 2016,20,Art Basel,David T,"If it's all about art you can better go to Mastricht in the Netherlands, for the annual TEFAF.  This is all about art not parties.  "
Beautiful gardens to visit on a blue sky day,January 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,825leilab,"Loved my visit here. Its 25 dollars to get in which isn't cheap but I felt it was well worth it. They have a tram that you can take around the tropical gardens with a guide who gives you lots of information about the history of the place and the various tropical plants there. The tours depart every hour on the hour. Our guide was fantastic! He spoke with a lovely Southern Accent and made sure everybody enjoyed the tour. We even saw a crocodile swimming in the lake whilst we were riding round. This place is just beautiful and a great place to take photos. I also spent some time in the butterfly enclosure where the lovely lady let me hold a gorgeous butterfly and gave us some really interesting information on them. The butterfly place is a must see as there are so many different butterflies all in one place. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area as I really enjoyed my time here and all the staff I encountered were nice also. They have good food and drink facilities onsite and clean well maintained toilets. I will recommend this place to colleagues, family and friends."
Night Garden Event ,January 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,nataliapM3250RV,Amazing experience.  It was a beautiful display. There was alot of traffic to get into the event. The valet was a joke. We had to oay to park our own vehicle.
Fairchild Tropical Gardens - Gardens Nights,December 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,HugsFromSweetPea,"Fairchild Tropical Gardens - Garden Nights open nightly in December by appointment. Walk thru Garden lit with lights and lasers, fairies and talking trees. Valet parking recommended. "
"Never biked, just golfed",December 2013,30,Granada Golf Course Bike Path,Jason H,"Don't expect much, just a way to play 9 holes with your friends who probably happen to be bad golfers too. For under $30 for 9 and a cart, you can't go wrong."
Not just the Mango Festival - Fairchild is a year round attraction.,October 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Gustavo D,"Loved walking around the grounds.  It's like a section of preserved Miami land.  Amazing setting, you have to see it at least once, preferably annually!"
Brand new air-conditioned baseball/softball facility with great equipment!,October 2016,50,Play More Baseball,robinp1,"Very clean and well-maintained with knowledgeable staff and instructors.  Cool technology like Coaches Eye, Motus and Zepp."
Bright Voices,April 2013,50,Seraphic Fire & Firebird Chamber Orchestra,Monique V,This group are true professionals with panache and gusto.  This was my first concert and I plan on returning as often as I can!
In Need of Care,October 2015,20,Modello Wayside Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"Though I do appreciate and admire every park, natural area, and green space in Dade County, unfortunately not a lot of care has been put into Modello Wayside Park. It is very similar to nearby Seminole Wayside Park in that it doesn't even have a parking lot or official entrance. You have to literally pull off US1 and jump the curb to park under the trees themselves. Residents that live nearby can however walk there. Just like Seminole Wayside Park, there are shaded areas for picnicking, but also trash in need of removal and homeless folks lurking about. There were also no restrooms, so the trees themselves must serve this purpose."
If you need a book for your airplane ride this is a good stop,March 2017,40,Books 4Travel,fizzy1991,"This book store in the Miami airport is a great place to find a book if you ""packed"" yours in the bag that you checked.  Yep, that's what I did.  They have a good selection of best sellers and ""old faithful authors "".  I just hate paying the full price but if your desperate this place is great."
Early Christmas present,December 2016,50,Seraphic Fire & Firebird Chamber Orchestra,floridatravelmom,Got there a little close to show time and had to race in from parking. Sat in the balcony and couldn't see very well but who cares as you only need to close your eyes to be transported by the most beautiful voices. Clear as a bell. Lovely performance. This was their Christmas show.  Also the conductor kept the audience entertained between songs. Recommend. 
Rooster Walk ,November 2019,40,Havana Rooster,LollysLook,"Along Calle Ocho in Little Havana, you can find decorative Roosters. They were put on the street in 2002 as part of ""Rooster Walk"" project by artists in the Little Havana neighborhood. One of the them was the late Cuban sculptor Tony Lopez. "
Really great gallery with very fun events,November 2015,50,Yo Space Gallery & Studios,David Y,"If you are interested in Miami's art scene and want to see the product of many of Miami's most talented artists, definitely check out Yo Space."
Architectural Landmark.

"""Art-Broken"" show  is worth on being visited....",October 2014,50,Kavachnina Contemporary  Art Gallery,Venus B,"Exhibition  has a great curatorial level ,  offers a  a variety of contemporary art styles through works by high quality artists , it pretends  not only  to entertain visually but to engage intellectually."
Horrible customer service,March 2019,10,Baggage Checkroom,Seetheworld200,The low rating is for the customer service. The staff here is very rude and unprofessional. The prices range from $6 and up to store pieces of luggage. They accept credit cards and require photo identification to leave bags. They also take a photo of you when you drop off and pick up the luggage for security reasons. The baggage check is called communitiel baggage and is located near the terminal E security checkpoint on the second level.
Never disappoints,March 2016,50,Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation,Elenasoni,The Cisneros for natural N is a must for art lovers visiting Miami.  It always exhibits interesting Latin American artists In their spectacular space. Staff is always available to guide you through the grouch the work.  
Nice place for talented teens,June 2017,50,YoungArts National Headquarters,Diala B,"People working there are very nice, and I hope I can submit my writing work in at somepoint in time :)"
Yo Space Gallery,January 2017,30,Yo Space Gallery & Studios,387indy,"The decor is vibrant colors, you would think you are in Little Haiti, and you are. Parking is easy, the facility is large , clean, and with lots of colorful artwork. Their are some artist on location that are happy to explain their work."
Great place for a peaceful stroll,January 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,sdf66,My second visit and this time I took my wife so she could enjoy the beauty of the gardens. We walked around the central lake and through the butterfly enclosure and rare plants area. All were excellent.
Big mall with lots of restaurants with live performances.,July 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,WencyB,It’s a huge indoor outlet mall with lots of food choices. The restaurants at the back have live performances that people can dance to. It is packed no matter what time of day it is. 
Big!,August 2019,30,Dolphin Mall,GLPJ62,"A huge mall full of lots of different shops. Don’t expect massive discounts tho, we checked prices online & lots of items were similar priced in the UK or from amazon. There are a few outlet/discount stores in the mall which were really good value including Levi’s which was a lot cheaper than in the UK. Now the UK has discount malls/outlet stores, there aren’t the huge discounts to be had that there once were - it’s worth a visit tho. "
terrible experience,August 2019,10,Dolphin Mall,David C,PLEASE BE CAREFULL  THERE ARE THIFS :( it was very fast :(
Good time ,August 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,976noelm,"Great Mall to visit with family or tourist. Mall has everything from good popular name brands to even stores with great product and selection.

Very nice and free transportation,May 2019,50,Metromover,Chris M,We used the Metromover between various locations in Miami. The trains are convenient and free. They make frequent stops at all the places you might want to go in downtown Miami. 
Wow,July 2019,50,Metromover,Tiffany  A," . what a great idea and easy way to get around town, my son's first time and he thought figuring out our route was fun"
FREE,July 2019,50,Metromover,jaypep1,"What can I say this is a great way to  get around the city centre and a little bit  further and it's free. There's three loops, one around the city center, one heading south,  and one heading north."
Easy,July 2019,50,Metromover,961Catherine182,A cheap & easy way to get around for free. A big bravo to the city of Miami who not only  caters to the very rich tourists but to the ordinary tourists too. Very easy to get around & fast

"It is fun to walk down the street, love the atmosphere.",February 2019,50,Espanola Way,Rosemary777,"I went to espanola way at night, and had dinner at Italian restaurant, it was really fun, even if you just walk down. There are lots of restaurants both sides, the street is filled with lots of energy.  I never see this kind of street. It's worth to walk there."
Good walk and great architecture,February 2019,40,Espanola Way,TomFarhias,"We were to the Espanola Way in the morning, therefore it was quite calm and with very few people. Not even all the restaurants/cafes were open. Anyway, for a family with children, this was the right  time of the year. It was a nice walk, an opportunity to take a look at the interesting architecture and a relaxed time. We didnæt spend more than 15 minutes there, walking to the one end and walk back. Take a look if you are around."
The Street with the Awesome Ambiance,March 2019,50,Espanola Way,TheExplorerFamily,Worth at least one visit for an out-of-this-world feeling.

Fashion district,November 2018,50,Miami Design District,AdriannaNY,Great place to visit and maybe shop. There are bars and restaurants in this area so you may plan the whole afternoon here.
Beautiful shops and arty stuff,November 2018,50,Miami Design District,PDScholten,"Very nice (expensive) shops in an artistic scenery. Lonely Planet combines this district as "" Wynwood and the art district"", BUT: the design district is 10 blocks away from Wynwood and needs another taxi drive!"
Not overly impressed - but great environment ,November 2018,30,Miami Design District,MatthewH350,"Very impressive architecture - but I’m not a fan of modern art.  The atmosphere is calming and the shops highly expensive!  That said, the art is worth the hour walking around.  "
Nice for short stop,October 2018,30,Miami Design District,FennyGrochocki,"I was not a big shopper hence trip to mall or shopping area was not high on my list, however it was a nice drive around and walk around to look at the artwork around the building. The place was clean and relaxing."
NICE PLACE TO VISIT,July 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,AnaBT8,"Breathe, reflect, write, and get inspired in the heart of Miami Beach. Escape the chaos, traffic and crazy drivers and come here where you can find your inner self and peace. "
Don’t try walking here with the construction ,September 2018,20,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,MW956,"Confusing and difficult to get to with all the construction. In terms of the garden itself, I’m sure it’s a good event space & the convention center is right nearby, but not that great of a botanical garden. More of a nice place to have a wedding or business event. "
"Relaxing Respite in the middle of a busy, touristy area",August 2018,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,miamimimi2018,Adjacent to the entrance is the Holocaust Memorial also worth a visit.
Lush escape from the city,August 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Besabab,"I recommend combining this with a trip to the Holocaust Memorial, as the two attractions are right next to each other. You can park in the same lot for both. If you go to both, plan 2 hours total for your trip. If the construction is still happening by the convention center, be prepared to drive around to find something. Also, the walk there may be tricky based on which sidewalks are closed."
Lovely and Lush,October 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Darlyne B,Although not a large garden it’s full of great plant and tree species. We loved discovering the lively and very healthy bee hive atop the gazebo as well as the koi pond obviously well tended. The whole experience was topped off by the fabulous gift shop clerk whose vibrant personality made us want to steal him away for the afternoon. A must see!
Great Place to Spend the Afternoon,May 2019,40,Little Havana,franc364,"This area was recommended to us by our hotel.  It was worth it for sure.  It was fun to walk around, get some awesome food, Cuban coffee, and listen to Cuban music.  It was a lot of fun and great little shops.  A lot to see.  Check it out."
Great area to explore.,May 2019,50,Little Havana,Denise Z,"Everyone was very friendly, many don't speak English.  We loved walking around and just taking in the culture."
Interesting place to visit,June 2019,40,Little Havana,696jasminew,Our city tour took us to little Havana historic district. We stopped there for a the shoppes. Their selling point was the cigar industry and their Cuban coffee. They gave us a little taste of Cuban coffee when we stopped by the cigar store. Very good and strong coffee for sure. It’s an interesting district to visit. Just be careful walking down the street; there was some panhandlers around. 
Nice place to eat and shop,May 2019,30,Little Havana,Tatiana K,We came here for shopping (in general shopping is poor in Miami). But we also had nice national food... the place is dirty but tolerable.
Love Little Havana,May 2019,50,Little Havana,John H,"The best area in Miami. It’s got everthing, music, drinks, restaurants,dancing and dominoes.  We stayed at the LifeHouse hotel on SW 9th Street just around the corner from the famous Ball and Chain."
Awesome service..,November 2018,50,Miami Trolley,justyantony,We had a great time exploring Miami using this free service- Miami trolley.. it was easy to access with kids and had many stops near tourist attractions.
Wonderful 'free of charge' way to get round,December 2018,40,Miami Trolley,john t,"The service also appears to operate from 6am to 12am Monday to Saturday, and from 8am to 12am on Sunday, so really does provide a first class and comprehensive service "
Free air conditioned transport with WiFi??? Wow!!!!,January 2019,50,Miami Trolley,UhlBliss,"You can go all over Miami Beach middle and south on this great trolley. Drivers are nice and helpful, and cars are clean and cute. Occasionally almost too cold, but that's why I pack something with sleeves every where I go. Trolley stops every couple of blocks and stops are well marked. An app displays the cars in real time and Google maps tells you when they are coming in the transit directions."
Free Transportation,January 2019,50,Miami Trolley,BeachBunni,"This was a pretty good deal for getting around Miami for free.  The only issue I had was that it really wasn't clear where the stops were on the website maps so you had to keep an eye out for the sign boards.  It also wasn't clear where multiple lines stopped at the same stop.  According to the map, the Coral Way one should have had several stops with the Biscayne by the Bayfront Park area but I couldn't find a sign that had Coral Way on it.  So I never did get on that line but the Biscayne and Brickell took me where I needed to go."
Great trollies!,January 2019,50,Miami Trolley,LoBommer,First class way to travel for free in Miami Beach.
Modern Art,October 2016,40,Britto Central,mmmatos,The artist Britto make some of the finest articles. The store is full of the pieces signed by the artis.
totally love Britto,October 2016,50,Britto Central,Gloria P,"We love Britto's art and accessories.  A few years ago we bought a piece of Britto handluggage...and people always ask..where did you get that?  Or they smile and point...Britto is happy art...So we purchased another hand luggage...and some Disney ceramic statues to add to our collection we already have by Britto.  We were very excited to see Britto's art gallery and the fun shop....A very large selection of many articles...which all bring a smile to our faces. and throughout Miami Beach we saw statues By Britto...gorgeous, large statues...an accomplished artist! And fun shops!  Don't miss!"
Happy fun art,April 2016,50,Britto Central,Vicente G,"Britto's pop art has taken the world by storm. Not only the gallery, but his work it's fun, colorful, giving you the idea of happiness. I love it!"
"Pretty little store (there are 2) to see a masters work; but it's still ""pop"" culture to me",October 2016,40,Britto Central,FloridaFelix,"Like most people, we love bright, shiny things.  Britto makes them in all (mostly prime) colors and shapes.  A great visit, but I have no need to own one. Found lots of Britto souvenirs at ALL the tourist shops...down to $10 from $10,000."
bal harbor hotel,April 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,hello123321,best place to go nice and comfy great service nice view across nice shopping mall food and attractions in the area 
When you want a five star holiday in Miami,March 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,rossmcb,For a high quality beach holiday away from the craziness of south beach - this is the place. Safe and five star area.  Bal Harbour shoppes are luxury mecca.  Highly recommend
Collins Avenue Miami,July 2014,50,Bal Harbour Beach,lapom1,"If in Miami don't forget to go here,one long avenue with beautiful white sandy beaches no wonder many stars live here, beautiful shops and restaurants."
"Quiet, Relaxing and Enjoyable",March 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Candice F,"Great place to visit for a low key solo, friend or family quick get away or extended stay. Great location. Easily accessible to Miami, Hollywood and Ft. Lauderdale by car.  "
Nice beach!,February 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,MDIspas,"A very nice beach, with a lot of high-class restaurants and hotels.  Quite a clean beach, also in the publich sector of it. "
Captivating,May 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,anacarolinaf467,"This small museum has an interesting collection of diverse objects (more than 100.000), and the cool part is that the exhibits change from time to time, meaning you can visit more than once. This time we saw one exhibit on Russian posters that was very interesting. "
"Funky, smartly arranged museum with well curated exhibits",May 2018,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Matt S,"This is a quirky museum based on a personal collection that has been well expanded. If you're a fan of early 20th-century design, it's a very pleasurable diversion from some of the noisier, flashier parts of South Beach."
What a place,May 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,gabeandcyn,"We were delighted to realize that our hotel provided free admission to the Wolfsonian. we walked accross and we were surprised at houw gorgeous this place is. great exhibits and programing, you would never believe how marvelous this place is. I really enjoyed the visit... By the way, they have a great coffee shop with the best cappucino, great ministore too. Awesome!"
Closed on Wednesday,February 2018,10,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,terrie55557,Website does not list hours.  Drove an hour to go and closed on Wednesdays.  Really disappointed we could not go.
Unique,January 2018,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,BigoBoca,This museum is difficult to describe because it has a collection of such a variety of quirky eye candy. 
Great homes,December 2014,30,Fisher Island,Vonschmidt,"We love archecture and this project has plenty of it, all seems fairly new but very stylish and there are some lavish places "
Wow!,June 2015,50,Fisher Island,Alex W,A must see during a visit to Miami. Lifestyles of the rich and famous could have been conceived here.
Fisher isn't what it used to be,June 2015,30,Fisher Island,AnitaMarshall,"no service, hard to get to , not a friendly resort. they used to be good but not anymore. would not recommend or return."
Not for your average society by far,June 2015,50,Fisher Island,Rbenson03,"I love Fisher Island but let's face it, for most people they are only going to see the outside of Fisher Island. In order to go on Fisher Island ( Billionaire's Row ) you better be Oprah, Beyonce, Madonna or part of their entourage. I have had the privilege of staying on Fisher Island and NOTHING on that ISLAND IS CHEAP!!  To book a room is about $600.00 a night or more, and you cannot get there by car. You have to  Ferry or have a private Helicopter.  "
Amazing,August 2015,50,Fisher Island,doreenm299,Houses are beautiful if you can manage to find yourself a reason to make your way there it is worth it just amazing
In LOVE with LAMBINI!!,March 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Jhalaby,Yesterday my husband and I had one of the greatest experiences ever when we visited the Miami Zoological Foundation.  The general tour was fascinating; the tour guide got us up close with the animals and explained things about them in great detail.  He took his time talking and answering questions and never rushed.  Afterwards we had the opportunity to hold some of the small animals.  But the pinnacle of the experience was my one on one encounter with LAMBINI!! I have always wanted to interact with a chimp and the reality of this encounter was better than I could ever imagine.  Thanks so much to the caring and professional staff at the foundation.  Lambini is a part of me now and he has given me sweet memories that will never be forgotten!!
Did the 2 hour tour and the baby tiger toir,March 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,R5389MSmichaelm,"It was amazing. Our tour guide is very knowledgeable, energetic. You can feel his passion about wildlife. Highly recommended his tour. The set up of the place is more like a refuge. They know the history of every animal staying there. It is not like a zoo and not commercial. "
ZWF Wildlife Presentation & Tiger Cub Encounter,March 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,BHS_78,"If given the chance, I will return to ZWF and do a few more encounters!"
An incredible experience... a MUST do!,February 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,laur2525,It is WELL worth the money. Leave the Miami beaches for half a day - you won't regret it!
So much fun!!,March 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,sasenagirl,"We were hesitant to come at first because the price seemed so high, but this place was so amazing and worth it.  My 14 and 12 year olds loved the animals and it was so fun to interact with some of them.  This is an experience unlike other zoos.  The tour guide we had was so great."
Really liked this place,February 2017,40,Art Basel,Christine T, Came here with my husband we had a pretty good time watching artwork.  Only part I didn't like was it took us almost an hour to find parking 
Too high falutin',December 2016,10,Art Basel,Elaine T,"I've been to Art Basel twice and have found it to be a disappointing experience both times. Workers in the booths tend to talk only to people they judge to be able to purchase their products. This, unfortunately, does not always work out for them. I was seriously interested in a piece of art, but the people staffing the both wold not give me the time of day. HOWEVER, there are many, many art shows that run concurrent with Art Basel, and the whole scene is fun. Also DO NOT miss the graffiti art everywhere in Wynwood! New every year. Even more fun to wander around a few days before Art Basel opens and watch the outdoor artists at work!"
A fun show,December 2016,40,Art Basel,larsh481,I can only compare this show to the Armory Show in NYC. This is similar but being in Miami in Dec is a great time. This is a busy week in Miami and hotel prices will increase for this time period so be sure to book well in advance.
Art Basel Miami,March 2017,40,Art Basel,Jetset18MelM,"Art lovers of the world come to Art Basel Miami. Amazing, curious and interesting pieces on display. I was inspired on so many levels. I met awesome artists and art lovers. I can't wait to go back. Even if you do not like art. Something here will grab your attention. Miami does a superb job at hosting."
The best event in Miami.,April 2017,50,Art Basel,AlbertoMay,This event happens the first week of december and its the best week in Miami.  Full of millionaires ready to buy art and party the nights away.  By far the best week to be in Miami !!!
Great mural made from recycled windshields,September 2019,40,Myaamia,Andrew M,"It is easily found to the right of the TD bank. Quite a few buses are on this route, but once in Little Havana, this is a pleasant stroll on Calle Ocho. Other attractions nearby include the Santa Barbara catholic church, a short walk north, and the many monuments on the Cuban Memorial Boulevard, a short walk west."
A forgotten area of Little Havana,September 2019,40,Cuban Memorial Boulevard Park,Andrew M,"This is a great place to stroll and learn about Cuban history, although it is in a ""forgotten"" area of Little Havana."
Worth a visit while in the Design District,December 2018,40,Juan Carlos Maldonado Art Collection,annettefromm,"This is yet another of Miami's private museums. The collection of examples of abstract expressionism is small, yet significant representing artists from around the world.  They change exhibits one time a year, so it's well worth an annual visit if you live in Miami, or to be included on your itinerary if you are visiting the area."
Great Art gallery,January 2019,40,Goldman Global Arts,rschagrin,Located inside the Wynwood walls. A large gallery with huge walls to display large works of art. They had a one person show with amazing art.
The best known church in Little Havana,September 2019,40,St. Peter & Paul Catholic Church,Andrew M,"Another Catholic Church nearby is the Saint Barbara Church on SW 6th Street, and a sculpture of Mary holding her baby, may be viewed in the Cuban Memorial Boulevard Park."
Cuban Memorial Plaza,November 2019,30,Cuban Memorial Boulevard Park,LollysLook,The Cuban Memorial Park is a memorial to  those who fought for Cuban independence. It’s a green area with an eternal flame to memorialize the heroes 
Gigantic succulent nursery ,May 2019,40,Isaac Farms,Gardeng32,Worth a stop to view the endless tables of gorgeous well priced cacti and succulents.  Unfortunately they are unlabeled and the not staff do not help you. (Would be 5 stars if they were). Also great selection of pots
Guess what I forgot?,August 2017,40,Bayside Brush,Joe S,It is annoying when you get away on the trip to find you forgot something - the hair brush. Not a problem. Found the best selection of brushes to choose from. Happy with sales assistant’s service. Would come here to replace my brushes when needed.
Great sculpture of St Barbara,September 2019,40,Santa Barbara Natl Catholic Church,Andrew M,"If you walk south to the Cuban Memorial Boulevard Park, another catholic related sculpture will be seen, this time it is Mary holding her child. If you continue south, and turn left on SW 13th Street, the Peter and Paul Catholic Church may be viewed."
Forget the Convention Center!!!!,December 2018,50,Spectrum Miami,watersignwoman,lie: I know him! But he’s amazing and he’s one of a hundred artists you can see at Spectrum!
Community Park,July 2015,30,Esther Mar Armbrister Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"I had driven past Armbrister Park hundreds of times on my way to Coconut Grove, but was unaware of it's name and had never set foot in it, as is the same for many Miami residents. it is conveniently located just off US1 on Grand Avenue. This is an average park which has a large football field, a shaded playground and basketball courts in the back. Nothing overly impressive. I did not observe any wildlife in this park, not even a bird. It is however located in an area of Coconut Grove with the most poverty and crime, so this free activity center is a good alternative to the streets for many youths. Knowing the crime level of this area, be aware of your surroundings, and do not leave anything of value in your car, as break ins are common in this area. As tourists don't often visit this area due to the slums and crime, it is one of the few areas of Coconut Grove that thankfully has free parking. The corrupt and greedy City has metered basically all the rest."
Gone to the Dogs,July 2015,20,Perrine Wayside Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"Perrine Wayside Park is very similar to the nearby Veterans Wayside Park in that it has a crater like lake in the center shaded by trees and is surrounded by limestone cliffs. Parking and admission are free. When I was little, I used to fish at this park and children came to play. Now due to the pressure of a small minority of dog owners, the park has been converted into a dog park and with it many changes. There are now prison-like metal gates enclosing the park, including a separate gated area for smaller dogs. Most disturbing are the following reasons how this park has been destroyed following it's conversion to a dog park: The once clear water is now a thick, algae filled pea soup green. This algae bloom is surely due to the large amount of nitrogenous dog waste making it's way into the lake: from swimming dogs relieving themselves in the water, as well as storm run-off from the grass. The water most likely contains high levels of fecal coliform bacteria as well, and those who let their dogs swim should be cautious, especially around children. This stagnant water is no doubt a breeding ground for mosquitoes as well, which impacts all of the surrounding neighborhoods. I saw what appeared to be a water circulator in the center of the lake but it wasn't making a difference. The aquatic plants which once grew on the shoreline sadly now appear to have been torn to shreds by the dogs. Fishing is no longer allowed as you don't want to hook a dogfish. As you walk the trails you can smell the dog waste in the garbage pails. In the past the park was teeming with wildlife including waterfowl and other birds. Most of them sadly appear to have met their fate from canines or been scared off. Now all I saw was a few brown anole lizards, turtles, and some small mosquito fish (which may have been added to control the mosquito larvae)  When I visited today there were no dogs present, so most visitors are doubtful to even see that much wildlife. Unfortunately many stubborn dog owners still want to convert the nearby Veteran's Wayside Park into a dog park as well. Hopefully the city can learn from what happened to Perrine Wayside Park and won't make the same mistake twice."
Cute little neighborhood park,August 2016,30,Rockdale park,mwooduk,Love this little park close to my house - nice little walking path and dogs are allowed and poop bags are provided.  So far it's been well maintained and has sufficient shade and trees to provide some relief in the hot sun.   It's small but great for exercising before or after dinner.  Dogs must stay on a leash
Great place to walk before dinner!,February 2017,40,Rockdale park,mwooduk,"Came here to walk last night before dinner as within one mile from my house.  Great little local park and the people you meet on the walking trail are friendly and say hi.  Nice little local facility, recommended."
Love this dog park,November 2015,50,Perrine Wayside Park,Janin E,This is a beautiful park to visit with your dogs. I like to keep mine on a leash and simply walk them around the area. It is quite scenic and pretty. I would never let me dog in the water though. 
Disgusting!,January 2017,10,Perrine Wayside Park,LeslieBlazys,Don't bother calling the County because it won't do any good.
Kick A$$ Place to Knock Out Your Stress,October 2018,50,CKO Kickboxing,IamPlatinum,"Fernando and his team kick butt at what they do -- getting your mind, body and fitness right. Nothing better than punching and kicking a bag after a stressful day at work."
OK Park,August 2015,30,Flagler Grove Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"Flagler Grove Park is one of the newer parks in Dade County. Not an overly impressive park, but every park is important for the local community. There is a medium sized field that can be used for soccer or other recreational activities, and a small covered playground. I didn't sight any wildlife, but the weather was bad the day we visited and it began to pour hard. It is conveniently located close to US1 and within walking distance of residential neighborhoods."
Excellent gallery in Wynwood!!!,November 2013,50,Robert Fontaine Gallery,herskowich,Robert Fontaine Gallery is a true gem in the Wynwood art district.  The work selection is outstanding.  Robert has great taste when it comes to choosing the artists he represents.  If you are in the area dont hesitate to go in.  You wont be disappointed!!!   
The Worst Museum Experience Ever-Horrible,May 2012,10,Dade Cultural Center,john33426,"The exhibit was open, the permanent exhibit was closed at the Museum of art! The guard I dealt with was rude when I asked a question. Her behavior was horrible.. There was no customers in this place and 8 guards watching us like we were going to steal the garbage they had on exhibit. Avoid this place, There was no one in museum store, no place to eat. I hope the curator is reading this, I've been going to museum for 30 years and this was the worst experience."
Wanted it all,November 2013,50,Robert Fontaine Gallery,Dennygirl13,Will definitely be keeping an eye on what's here in the future .......
It is an interesting place to visit.,January 2019,40,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,nextbigadventure123,"I never knew there were so many different types of palm trees!  Ride the tram first then walk back to get a better look at what interests you.  Don’t miss the butterfly exhibit, it is very interesting."
Christmas Village a la Miami!,December 2019,50,Bayfront Holiday Village,Dallende,"The holiday village at Bayfront Park is full of wonderful gems. I was able to check off my Christmas list, while browsing the cute stores that displayed everything from hand-made purses made of wood, toys, jewelry and pashminas. I was amazed at the caliber of items available in the village. Vendors from Portugal, Italy, Turkey and even Bethlehem displayed their products, and I made a serious dent in my wallet, but I'm almost done with my Christmas shopping. I also loved the food. I ate a delicious lobster roll, and because I RSVP'd online at bayfrontholidayvillage.com, I got a free Christmas Makers Shaker at the Makers Mark Bar! Speaking of bars, they have the North Pole Beach Club, which is a great place to sit back and watch the boats go by while sipping a Peppermint Mojito. I had quite a few of those, while my nieces rented rollerskates at Bayskate to skate around the 50 ft. Christmas Tree. That tree is unlike any I've seen in Miami. It's animated, and several times a night, they lower the lights and rev up the music and put on an LED Christmas tree show. It's amazing. I also enjoyed nibbling on caramel apples at Ricky's Arepas and by the end of the night, we bought some hot chocolate and churros to people watch. This is a wonderful place to get into the spirit and enjoy Miami weather. It runs all the way through Christmas day, so we plan to be back again and again."
Wonderful garden and butterfly habitat,January 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Sharon R,"We like walking and what better place to do it than this beautiful garden in Coral Gables.  They seemed to specialize in orchids and there were some beautiful displays.  The tropical rain forest is very lush.  The butterfly habitat was really great with some spectacular one flying all around you.  You can even have one sit on your arm for pictures.  Altogether, a lovely day."
Shows you gorgeous greenery,January 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,dldmia,"Fairchild Tropical Botanical Gardens is a local treasure.  Decades of superb community leadership have resulted in a vastly improved facility and world-class destination.  Special events are worth it, too. "
Lovely time with butterflies,February 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Seajai,"Sure, you can walk among the lovely vegetation and small lakes, but the butterfly enclosure will entrance you. So, so many butterflies, many as big as my hand, all fluttering around or nibbling food."
Beautiful visit,January 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Sandy A,We visited on a beautiful Tuesday in January. The grounds and foliage were exquisite. The butterfly garden was amazing. The staff in the butterfly garden shared so much information. I’d definitely return! It’s a must-see!
Okay Park,June 2015,30,Colonial Drive Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"Colonial Drive Park is located just to the North of Colonial Drive Elementary school. As it is surrounded by low income minority neighborhoods, it is a good place to go for free recreation. There are tennis and basketball courts, 2 activity buildings, a football field, a water splash area available for rentals, and 2 baseball fields. The Larger baseball field was all fenced off due to high levels of toxic contamination found in the soil, like many other parks in the area. There is a walking/bike path which goes around the park. There is a tiny area of preserved natural pine rockland habitat with native plants  on the West side of the park which the walking/bike path goes through. Not a lot of wildlife was observed: just a hawk, anole lizard, and a grackle. Unfortunately the natural area has been littered with garbage, and does't appear to have been cleaned  up in a long time. Also be careful of the tires on your bike or car as there was broken green glass everywhere. Apparently those who use the park as a drinking spot, prefer Heineken. Illegal drinking at this park shouldn't be a surprise, as there were no park staff or security anywhere to be seen. Parking and admission is free."
The most recognisable monument in Little Havana,September 2019,50,Bay of Pigs Monument,Andrew M,"In the months that followed, the political intrigue of denials and prisoner negotiations was a daily feature, but ended in the prisoners being sent back to Miami in exchange for US$53m in food and medicinal supplies.  Most of the Brigade returned to this area which became known as Little Havana. This was a pivotal moment in history, as after the failed invasion, the Cuban Government embraced the Soviet regime, and this led to the ""Cuban Missile crisis"" the following year which was one of the highest points of the cold war. A short walk south of this monument , is a sculpture of Nestor Izquierdo, who was a senior figure in the brigade. The Bay of Pigs Museum and Library is a short walk east to 1821 SW 9th Street, and provides additional information on the conflict."
Last Call Neiman Marcus,August 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,Elqueesha,Berta Carral
Simple but very elevating,December 2016,40,St Vladimir Russian Orthodox Church,alejandroz292,This is a simple Russian Orthodox Church. The most important thing in a Church is the priest and the priest here is extraordinary.
Best shopping option,August 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,andreacambon,Dolphin is my first choice for shopping in Miami. Not o my because it has outlet stores but also because it’s not as huge as other Miami malls. However it still has everything you need 
The place to buy anything ,August 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,sarat271,Very large mall with a circular design with something for everyone. Variety of stores and eating places including counter and table service. 
Small but Unique Park,December 2014,40,Rock Ridge Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"Rock Ridge Park is located right off 117th Ave in West Miami, surrounded by suburban development. Though not a large park, it it differs from most. It gets it's name due to the fact that the park is filled with boulder sized coral rocks scattered about like a field of meteorites, some weighing hundreds of pounds. Though it does make the landscape more interesting, parents do however have to keep a closer eye on their kids, as they can easily crack their heads open on these massive rocks, or break a bone if they fall/slip while rock climbing. There is a walking path which is shaded by beautiful palm trees. There is a playground, but no bathroom facilities. Parking and entrance is free."
Farmers market ,November 2019,30,Wynwood Farmers Market,LollysLook,The Wynwood farmers market is a small area of food trucks and kiosks dorm the block from the walls. We tried a coconut smoothie. 
Good entrance to the Wynwood Walls,May 2016,30,Wynwood Farmers Market,IA_Hawks,"A smaller market with fresh food and drinks as well as crafts, clothes, and other items it is a nice entrance if you are making your way to the walls to look at the artistry."
"Very Small, Great Nachos",July 2016,30,Wynwood Farmers Market,kaitlina714,"One of the vendors was making fresh nachos, with three meat choices and vegetarian options.  We got a sample and they were hot and delicious.  The market could grow more and branch out into selling more fresh food options, like vegetables and fruit, but it's a nice place to go in the mornings on the weekend."
Lots of good things ,August 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,Iamtoyabella,"Got exhausted after 3 hours,need to go back. "

Best way to navigate downtown!,August 2018,50,Metromover,MM1127,"Very clean, found pax very helpful, fast and easy to board. We had taken the metro rail and then we switched to the mover to avoid parking and walking all over. Best decision."
Best wat to get around downtown,July 2019,50,Metromover,DonaLevine,The metromover connects with metrorail in Miami.  It’s an easy transition from one to the other.  I highly recommend it
Awesome investment in Miami,July 2019,40,Metromover,quiglm,Miami is so progressive and an example to other major US metropolises.
Free Service,July 2019,50,Metromover,Veronica H,I took the free service from First Street Station to Fifth Street  Station in Brickell City Center to enjoy walking and dining in that area of Miami.
Metro in sky,July 2019,30,Metromover,cocob843,"The metromover is the best choice to discover Miami downtown easily and cheapest price because it’s free ! Different stop in the city, 3 lines, 3 loops! The quality of metromover is ok but not perfect .. I’ll still recommend. "

Nicely designed Design District,December 2018,40,Miami Design District,dunsienda,"If you like art, high end shopping, nice dining and/or urban design that is geared toward pedestrians, it's a lovely way to spend a few hours. We parked at the city garage (think it was 38th street) and spent about 5 hours going to museums and galleries (ICA, the de la Cruz foundation and a very informative and attractive gallery exhibit regarding fashion impacts on environment ), window shopping and then having early dinner at Mandolin Aegean Bistro (also reviewed that). While you don't have to go to the museums to see art as it's incorporated in the district via large scale murals, interesting buildings and unexpected artistic touches on trees and in alleys, you should because they do Not charge admission. Worthwhile to check out."
Shopping,December 2018,50,Miami Design District,worldlywomen1,"Nice area to stroll around and do some shopping, the area is very walkable.  Nice shops galore.  Walkable area."
Area to stroll around,December 2018,40,Miami Design District,PetriKoo,Design district has plenty of interesting building to see. However it seems to become more and more of a shopping area since all the high end luxury brands seem to have their store on area.
Impressive collection of high end shops,December 2018,50,Miami Design District,EJE123,"The Miami Design District is a neighborhood that mainly features a number of very high end clothing and jewelry brands. The collection of stores is impressive and the area is easy to navigate. It's fun to just walk around the area, but if high end shops aren't your thing, then this won't be of interest."
Walking around,December 2018,50,Miami Design District,juliob837,It is located close to Wynwood. You may consider visiting it first and then hitting Wynwood.

Excellent Gardens - and Free!!!!,November 2018,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,MatthewH350,I am a sucker for nice gardens and have a “green thumb” or at least try really hard outside!  The gardens are well laid out - easy to traverse and have a nice combo of color.  During our visit the butterflies were busy and it was a nice way to spend an hour.  We also met the gardens director who stopped and greeted us and actually took some time to explain some of the features to us.  Very classy.  Strongly recommend this stop for others touring.  
It's Ok,November 2018,30,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Gerard V,We landed there by error. We were looking for the Tropical Botanical of Coral Gables. Interesting but it doesn't take long to go around. Obviously just an area to unload and relax  if you are attending an event at the Convention center across the street. Probably not worth making the trip just for that. The attendant at the Nature center shop was extremely friendly and fun. I believe his name was Gaylord.
Botanical Oasis,November 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,ikabodski,Will visit every time I am in area (on working dyas)

Love Romero Britto,December 2016,40,Britto Central,beans27us,"Visited the Britto Central store and the Romero Britto Art Gallery both on Lincoln Rd. Very colorful, vibrant and original pieces of art on display. His designs are so unique they are worthy of a visit and you can purchase small pieces from his collection for less than $250."
Simply Fabulous!,December 2016,50,Britto Central,Mark D,"From the moment you walk in to Britto Central, you will smile.  The art is whimsical and uplifting.  The staff are very nice and know every piece.  As with all art, you'll either love it or you won't, but it's a great gallery and must-see if visiting Miami Beach."
Amazing and Creative Artist,December 2016,50,Britto Central,HonestTravellers64,Britto is one of my favorite artists and his gallery did not dissapoint. His creativity and fun spirit shine through his works of art and he brings a smile to my face everytime I see his work. The staff at the gallery were very friendly and helpful and shared several stories about the works of art. Great place to go if you want to smile!!
Positive point to check out,December 2016,50,Britto Central,marytraveller1986,"I love this artist since my first travel to Brasil. His art is a little bit childish, but very positive."
The best option for running or biking,October 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,394fabiang,"I went for a couple of runnings during my 3 day stayed in St Regis and was really awesome. Its quite, have a route were you can easily run for 5 to 8 miles. The beach is clean and nice."
"good for walking, but soon in shadow",November 2015,40,Bal Harbour Beach,HansM1959,"a nice destination to stroll or jogg on the beach, but with the many high rise buildings on the beach, very early in complete shadow. So more for early birds and jetlagged Europeans than those who are looking for a late afternoon stroll on the beach."
Loved it,November 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,558lac,"Great for couples. The bathroom, the shower was to die for. I washed my hair just because. The patio view late at night is so romantic. Nice spot for boo baby. Great breeze. I could live there if the price was reasonable, "
Very ritzy,January 2015,40,Bal Harbour Beach,cjval,"Nice area of Florida but not for the budget conscious!!!  Shopping, dining and lodging are all quite expensive."
really nice walking path,December 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,justme1954,"If you're into jogging, runnning, pushing a carriage -  the path right by the beach is a great place. There are trees for shade, and some benches for when you need a bit of relaxation. The wide expanse of white beach with lots of umbreallas from the various hotels is a very pleasant way to spend the day."
The best of industrial art.,September 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,brianfM4544DC,"After visiting several museums in Miami we took a stroll here. What a cool building in such a cool area. The permanent exhibit is very nice, displaying the art of industry. From toasters to vacuums, to furniture, you will like what you see and learn from these exhibits. Pay the fee support the arts, and get some culture on South beach."
An interesting place to visit,November 2017,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Stella-Dot,This museum is right on Washington Avenue and is a good place to visit if you are in the area.   It focused on industrial art with some really unusual exhibits to view.  Plenty of 20th culture here to appreciate and absorb.
"Outstanding Museum: Would gladly visit again, for the 4th time.",April 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Vahe K,"This is my favorite museum ever. It can be visited in a couple of hours, has a small permanent collection on display (most of it is in storage) and proposes great temporary exhibits. They mostly pertain to early 20th Century design, art, architecture and communications."
"""That was it?""",October 2018,20,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,margarets_dad,This should be one of the best museums in the country. Instead it's an enormous letdown.
Interesting ,October 2018,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,MichaelMc777,"The entry fee of $12 dollars seemed on the high side for such a limited exhibit. But, the money is going In the right direction."
Okay,September 2015,30,Fisher Island,ScottChildress,"Interesting houses of the rich and famous. Ian not too into that sort of thing, but we took a boat ride that was informative and nicely done. "

General Tour & Tiger Cub Photo with Rajah,May 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Chantelou,"Overall, I think it was worth the money and I was glad to give money to such a great organization."
Great Family Adventure.  General Tour and Tiger Experience with older son.,June 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,mom2my3tallapoosaGA,"Our family has visited many zoos all over the country.  We chose to visit this zoo because it is different.  The purpose of this zoo is to give visitors a personal experience and knowledge of the animals so they appreciate the need for zoos and conservation efforts.  It was a great experience.  Our guide, Chris, was very knowledgible  and interacted with the animals and members of the tour.  All, including our children with disabilities, were included in the interactions with animals.  As a combined celebration of my older son's adoption day anniversary and 16th birthday and great school year, we participated in a tiger cub interaction/photo session, a dream come true for him.  We were allowed interaction with the tiger cubs and as many photos as we wanted.  The cubs were allowed to play and be themselves and seemed to enjoy the session.  They were very considerate of our family with children with special needs.  Thank you for a great day and helping to make dreams come true!!  And thank you for raising awareness of the true function of zoos and importance of conservation and species survival."
One of the coolest experiences of my life (chimp encounter).,June 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,LegendIsland,Thanks to ZWF for having such great staff and showing me the time of my life. I haven't stopped smiling since I got home.
0% Customer Service ,June 2019,10,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,TravelingMomof4our,"Young kids are running the show with zero customer service. It saddens me to leave this bad review because this place has so much potential. We paid and made a reservation for Father’s Day to take a special tour that included some interactions. It ended up being a rainy day. We requested to forgo the tour part since it was raining and just do the interactions. The staff insisted it wasn’t possible to forgo the tour part. Yet, the tour part wasn’t an option because of the rain. The staff would not go forward with just the interaction section of our tour. They ended running Father’s Day for our family of six. This place needs to work on their customer service skills. My family has visited a dozen times because the interaction with the animals is great. It’s a place we used to love. They have lost us as customers until there is change with its customer service. "

best show in Miami beach  . do not miss it,December 2016,50,Art Basel,Fabrizio B,"best show in Miami beach  . do not miss itFor me the large representation of classic post 1960 artists like Andy Warhol, Barbara Kruger, Robert Mangold, Kenny Sharf and Basquiat is necessary bounty, but the inclusion of very good and slightly bizarre contemporary artists like Kehinde Wiley, and Paul MCarthy is what keeps me going back."
"Art Basel, the best art fair in the world",December 2016,50,Art Basel,emanueleviscuso,"There are a lot of art fairs in the world but I think that Art Basel in Miami Beach is the best one. The crowd is the international one with really incredible people coming annually from all over in the world. The art galleries are the most famous and international ones. The art is absolutely wonderful. You can look for Picasso or Dali as well as for young artist and new entries. But the best of this fair is that being in Florida in December, while in US or Europe is winter, in South Florida you can go to the beach in the morning, to the fair and related events all the day long and then you can have an incredible night of fine dining in hundreds fantastic places in town and then you can enjoy the metropolitan nightlife of Miami and Miami Beach till very late. Be prepared to a tour de force about the incredible amount of events, openings, cocktails and parties for the insiders from all over the world."
Impossible to miss this event !,December 2016,50,Art Basel,Miami666,"I love this event ! You have so many things to do and see during this week, expositions in all the city. Everywhere you go, something happen, even restaurants, on the streets, parks ..... Amazing ! "

The passion for Haitian culture is evident.,December 2016,50,Haitian Heritage Museum,jadorae,"I had an excellent time at the Haitian Heritage Museum! Upon arrival, I was greeted by one of the founders of the museum, Serge. He was very friendly and welcoming. He educated me on the history of the museum, and why it was created. In doing so, he also gave me a brief history of Haitians in Miami, Little Haiti, and, the country of Haiti itself. The passion Serge and his team have for Haiti, Haitians, and Haitian culture is highly evident in their carefully curated pieces on display. Their current physical location is temporary until they are able to build a permanent site. With that in mind, the pieces on display can be viewed as a ""sneak peek"" of what is to come once they move to their permanent site. I would highly recommend a visit here for anyone who likes art, history, Haitian culture, or looking for an experience off the beaten path."
TITAN's USA Coast to Coast Tour,September 2015,50,Frames USA & Art Gallery,HelenG747,"The itinerary, though 4 weeks long, was fascinating and extremely well paced.  Even my 89-year-old husband kept pace and loved every minute.  Our tour director, Joan Williams, was so well informed and shared her knowledge with us in a most interesting way that we can declare her our best tour director ever, which is quite a compliment coming from people who travel frequently and to all parts of the world.  And when we had problems at the airport before our departure, the entire Titan's support team jumped into action and made it possible for us to travel.  A big thank you to all of you.  You all deserve full marks!"
Welcoming,January 2017,50,St Augustine Church,Nanita65,"I don't think I'd the catholic guild talking when I say that this place truly feels like home. I've been looking for a catholic church that is not too rigid while in mass and that you feel the warm from people. This is the place. Not sure if the difference is because is close to the university but even the priests know how to connect with the people with their homilies. This was the 4th church I've visited in the Miami area... finally I found ""my church"". Hope they dioceses doesn't rotate the priests. They truly know how to deliver the messages  from the Bible in today's world. Great place. "
Good surprise,February 2012,50,Art Center -  Richard Shack Gallery,flaces,"Take a break from shopping. In the middle of Lincoln Rd Mall, you'll have a good surprise entering into ArtCenter/South Florida. Since you can appreciate contemporary visual art at artists' studios, you experience a different way to visit an art exhibition. Sometimes artists are working, so you can see them in their own environment. And it's free!"
Woodlawn on 117 Ave & 116 St.,June 2018,10,Caballero Rivero Woodlawn North,862carmena,"I am completely disappointed in the service received upon my fathers death. The initial “planning meeting” was fine and the employees were sensitive to our needs. I guess that’s only to make the blow of what you are spending more tolerable. The money necessary to pay for the costs of burying your loved one is immediate. Make no mistake about that! The viewing wasn’t awful, they just forgot to put the water bottles  that was included as part of the package. After the burial, it took 12 weeks to get a sketch, yes, just a sketch, on what would be placed on the marker. It’s been more than 6 weeks since reviewing a piece of paper with a sketch on it. After countless calls and texts, my fathers grave sight has yet to have a marker identifying where he’s at. I do not recommend Caballero Woodlawn. I have learned a lot in this process and the stress factor was unnecessary when dealing with a loss of a loved one!"

Best Thrift Store in Miami,April 2019,40,Red White & Blue Thrift Store,Damian R,"I would give 5 stars for the amazing things you can find for very reasonable prices but although the place is enormous, it is always teeming with voracious bargain hunters who may not always be the most polite. I'll brave the crowds any day and I do - quite often. If you are into thrifting and are visiting Miami, this is the place. I have found antiques, vintage everything, records, art, you name it. They just recently started accepting credit cards which makes it a lot easier. The lines are LONG but there are about a dozen cashiers who are all very nice."
A Hidden Gem,August 2015,50,FIU Nature Preserve,MrMiamiExplorer,"Though this nature preserve has been open to the public for decades, most in Dade County are unaware of it's existence. Surrounded by development like an island of foliage, this preserve contains a number of natural habitats: Pine Rocklands, Tropical Hardwood Hammocks, and Freshwater Wetlands. I was expecting to be through the whole preserve in a matter of minutes, but 30 minutes later I was still hiking the shaded trails. Just when you think you've reached the end, the trails continue to more habitats. It is hard to believe that you are surrounded by civilization, as just a few feet into the preserve, you can almost imagine being deep in the Florida Everglades. In addition to the trails, there is a lake on the West side which has a plentiful population of aquatic plants on it's shoreline including pond apples and cattails. I saw a variety of wildlife while exploring the preserve for less than an hour including: gray squirrel, brown & bark anole lizards, anhinga, spiny box spider, mockingbird, skipper butterfly, bull ant, and mosquito fish. Though admission is free and open to the public, nearby parking is at paid meters. I will definitely keep returning."

Ok visit,September 2019,30,Museum of Art and Design at Miami Dade College,Mary_Author,"Entrance is not free as I'd thought. It cost over 11.00 per person. There wasn't much to see and we couldn't go to the top floor. We could only explore 2 floors. IMO, the price isn't worth it. My daughter and I were disappointed."
Impressive artwork by Cuban Artist on Brickell Avenue Bridge ,November 2017,50,The Pillar of History,Reasonable50,"Great 53 foot column artwork on the Bridge that many pass without even looking. It was installed in 1995. The artist,  Manuel Carbonell, was a noted Cuban born artist and died in Miami at age 93. The column depicts natural and cultural scenes that were derived from Carbonell's understanding of native Tequesta Indians. Slow down and take a look next time you are there."

It's interesting to see the memorial mural with the map of Cuban and ship, however, it is very simple and you can take it all in relatively quickly. Worth seeing if you have a particular interest in Cuban history, but I wouldn't recommend a trip out of the way for the average tourist.  "

Incredible ecosystem,July 2019,40,Shark Valley Visitor Center,sweetjustine,"My husband and I drove the I41 from Miami to Marco Island and stopped at the Visitor Centre. The drive was easy and picturesque. Two lanes most of the time. Good signage. Not really knowing what to expect we are so glad we stopped. We took the 2hr covered tram ride to the observation walkway (45 mins there and then back) The cost ($19 for seniors plus $30 entrance fee) was higher than we expected but at least the money goes towards maintaining the park! The visitor centre has a small shop, water fountain and basic but clean restrooms. The guide and tram driver were very well informed and provided interesting commentary whilst pointing out the wildlife and stoping to allow visitors to take photographs. Recommend sitting on the non driver side on the way to the walkway and on the drivers side on the way back to get the best views. We saw baby alligators, an alligator nest, 4 adult alligators, turtles, dragonflies, tilapia fish and a variety of birds including egrets and herons. We had about 20 mins at the observation centre which is easy to access and has clean restrooms.  No mosquitoes! The tram driver had cold bottled water on board for sale ($1). If you are are not sure whether to visit such a unique ecosystem - I would say do! "
Average Visitors Center,July 2019,30,Shark Valley Visitor Center,Jake A,"The NPS visitors center was decent, and nothing special.  Had the routine items for sale. I was disappointed they did not have stickers for Passport books. They had stamps, so we did not totally strike out. If you go the Shark Valley,  you will have to go into the Visitors Center to buy Tram tickets. Overall it was nice, and clean. Bathroom were also kept up, so no issues there."
"Okay visitors centre, could use a little more",November 2019,30,Shark Valley Visitor Center,UniversalTraversal,"You go to Shark Valley to walk among the rivers rather than to see the visitor's centre.

Very nice art!,July 2014,40,Art Center -  Richard Shack Gallery,EladAvigan,Overall a nice place to check out if you're an art lover.
Fr Ayala. ,April 2017,50,St Augustine Church,anibaljuan,Fr Ayala. Excellent homily.  If you haven't been attending mass On a regular basis I suggest you give Fr Ayala a try.  May make you a regular.  
Catholic ,July 2017,40,St Augustine Church,622elianap,Catholic Church catering to University of Miami family.  Plenty of activities for students and young professionals.  It is a comfortable and welcoming parish with a plethora of mass times.
Excellent Catholic Church - Non-pretentious and in excellent location,July 2017,50,St Augustine Church,Andy M,This is an old established Catholic Church which is unpretentious and if what you want is to pray or attend service it is excellent. It is not a typical beautiful church but it is warm and well attended by University of Miami students as it is the closest church to campus. Parishioners are very nice. There is parking available but it can get full very quickly and have to park around the neighborhood. Check day and times for services. 
"""Miami See It Like A"" Native Classic Poster",August 2018,50,Frames USA & Art Gallery,Lyndon T,"I had a poster that needed to be repaired and framed. The company was professional, fast, and the quality was great. Thanks for a job well done."
What a pleasant surprise!,January 2019,40,Haitian Heritage Museum,Dr_Kello,"Admittedly I am a lover of Haitian Art, so I was a little prejudiced before I made the visit. Instead of paintings, there was a fabulous exhibit of photography by Marc Baptiste. It was also good fortune that the curator of the museum Evelyn was there to take us from photograph to photograph. She was so passionate, informative, and inspiring that I knew right then and there I was in the right place at the right time. As a special bonus, the discussion of art extrapolated into a discussion that was art unto itself. "
Very disappointing,September 2019,10,Haitian Heritage Museum,Melby7,"Haiti surely has a rich heritage in art and (even more so) handicraft. However, you don't find any of that here. This is a museum without artifacts. The exhibits are just some walls posted with texts and pictures about Haitian history. A bit like pages torn out of history textbook meant for elementary school . You would probably get more out of reading about Haiti on Wikipedia. A meaningless kind of museum, a waste of money that could be spent much better, whether on Haiti or in the Haitian communities in the US. Sadly, an example of Haiti at it's worst. The (nice and friendly) staff seemed to well appreciate the nonsense of this museum: Nobody turned up until ½ hour after official opening hours."
Great Gallery!,February 2016,50,San Paul Gallery,tnmann1,"San Paul Gallery is a must-see for artists, photographers, painters, musicians, and art appreciators.  A friend and I were at the airport hotel and looking for fun things to do in the area and came upon this charming gallery. We were absolutely delighted!  The music, the art, the general ambiance, was electric!  The staff was courteous and eager to answer questions about the exhibit.  If you're in the Wynwood area be sure to visit the gallery walk held every second Saturday of the month; I assure you there's something for everyone -art lovers and creative-types alike- you won't be disappointed!"
Charming,March 2016,40,San Paul Gallery,Luvs2TravelAnywhere,The San Paul Gallery is in Miami's art district near the Wynwood Walk. It is charming with some great pieces of art and worth a stop in as you are strolling around the art district.
REPEAT AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN!,February 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Mel L,"This is our 2nd visit, and I am sure no two visits are the same as seasonal changes provide a different experience every time!!  The butterfly garden is magical!  The orchids are glorious.  What a labor of love from all the volunteers who work tirelessly to keep the property immaculate, and all the plants trimmed/shaped/pruned so something is always in bloom.   Even if it is hot out, you can be in and out of shaded areas.  Also they offer benches in areas AND a tram/cart to get you around. And water stations!!  THANK YOU"
Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,March 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Joseph S,"Fabulous place to tour for hours. Wish I had brought the grandkids. Lucked out with perfect weather, but even in summer, this would have been worth the visit. The butterfly exhibit was astonishing, as as the Madagascar garden. The grounds are meticulously attended to, the volunteers - mostly older people - friendly and well-informed - and the experience eye opening for this guy who is usually not a botanic garden enthusiast."
Thanks ,March 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,F8854LXdavidr,"Went to the orchid show today. We meet Norma Craig, a volunteer. She gave us so much information and so many to go to places to go, I don’t think we’ll every finish our bucket list. Thanks for the patience and the background information she provided. I love self empowered women. "
Beautiful Tropical Garden !,December 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Azadirachta,"Beautiful Tropical Garden. The butterfly house is a must. Many palms species, there is a specimen african baobab of over 70 years old and even a nice exhibit of the dry forest forest of Madagascar ! The electric car tour free is interresting as you get a lot of information from the guide."
One of my happy places,March 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,katiesP7246XX,"I go to Fairchild Tropical Gardens whenever I need a little respite from the world ( I’m a member). It is a beautiful place to walk and enjoy the sun, fauna, butterflies , iguanas and lizards. I would highly recommend a visit - it will restore your soul!"
"Excellent location, and the care is improving.",December 2015,40,Ron Ehmann Park,Abuelo49,"This park has excellent location, over 10 acres of park land. The jogging trail needs quite a bit of repair and updates. The playground needs to be well cleaned with pressure hoses. The baseball field, the soccer field and basketball courts are very good."
Recreation Surrounded by Nature,January 2016,50,Ron Ehmann Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"This park is a perfect balance of recreation and nature. There is a playground, community center, tennis courts, basketball courts, and an activity field for soccer/baseball surrounded on all sides by an endangered pine rockland forest. There are is also a nature/jogging trail through the pine forest. As I hiked I observed a variety of wildlife including butterflies (including a rare Florida Atala), brown anole lizards, dragonflies, moths, and a spider. Parking and admission are free."
Vishnu Stone Sculpture By mogul Interior,March 2011,40,Martin Z. Margulies Sculpture Park,MogulInterior,"Vishnu is the Protector of the Universe.This is a very unique and wonderful reverse carving black stone vishnu statue. Vishnu has one head and four arms.In his hands he holds a discus, mace,couch-shell and one hand here rests on the lap, with upturned open palm. And vishnu sitting on serpent.His face is always clam and peaceful. His claws are dug into a snakes body and his beak is about to grasp a snakes head. He wears a crown on his head.Bedecked with precious jewelry adorns on his chest and his wrist.Vishnu in a protection posture."
walking park,December 2016,30,Kenneth M Myers Bayside Park,lalocadr19,"This park is near the water, beautiful to see the boat dock. The park is about 1-2 miles around. No fee for entrance, fee to park."
Impressive sales,March 2017,40,Havana Nines,T2879IKchristinep,Great beach and cruise wear from name brand designers. We were able to get 2 Tommy Bahama shirts at 50% off and a Tommy Bahama dress at 70% off.
One of the Largest,July 2015,40,Palmetto Bay Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"Palmetto Bay Park is one of the largest areas of green space in all of the City of Palmetto Bay. It is conveniently located just off US1 and is within walking distance of many neighborhoods. Visiting on a late Monday afternoon there were plenty of people of all ages and races enjoying the park. There are biking/jogging trails, outdoor exercise equipment, soccer, football & baseball fields, a playground, and wide areas of grass and trees. The baseball fields have netting over the bleachers to protect spectators from home run balls. The wildlife I observed over the 1 hour I was present at the park consisted of mostly birds and included: white ibis, mocking birds, blue jays, grackles, and others. The East side of the park was well maintained and had green freshly mowed grass. Unfortunately the far West side of the park does not appear to be routinely maintained as it had a lot of lumpy, sick looking brown grass filled with weeds and trash especially in the Southwest corner. The grass was also long in this West side area and the middle of the field was used as a dumping ground for old metal soccer goals, many of which were lying in rusty heaps on the ground. Besides these eyesores the only other aspect of the park which wasn't cheery, was the Miami Children's Hospital Outpatient Center built on the Northwest side of the park. The park's bike path even goes right up to the hospital's back door. On the positive side, at least the kids inside the hospital can look out the windows to see a park, and maybe play games in the park before or after a medical appointment. There are beautiful shady Poinciana trees lining the jogging trail, perfect for picnicking under. There was also a variety of other flowering and even fruiting plants (mangoes, coco plums) Parking and admission are free.This was my first visit, and I will keep returning."
Great vibrant church - perfect for all ages and great for kids,May 2017,40,Miami Vineyard Church,mwooduk,"I recently visited the Miami Vineyard as I had an unchurched friend that I wanted to take there to see if it might be the kind of church she would like to attend.  The Vineyard is large and offers four services at the weekend (on both Saturdays and Sundays) as well as social events, coffee before and after the service, lots of activities and is especially good for families.   The music is loud and vibrant, with lots of singers and musicians on the stage;  the pastor's sermon had multiple points and I would say has the kind of content that you can apply to your life right away, however, I would not say that it was theologically deep so it's a perfect place for seekers, new believers and younger families although there was a smattering of people over 55 in the congregation the night we went.  Very approachable, very casual (jeans and shorts) and very multi media friendly."
"Fresh, new theater in Miami --- In English and Spanish!",December 2017,50,Microtheater Miami,Daniel P,"If you want to get a sense of the local culture in Miami, Microtheater Miami is an interesting way to do it on a night out!"
Biggest Bonsai Collection,November 2016,50,Miami Tropical Bonsai,scoutdreams,"In the Northern part of Redland is Miami Tropical Bonsai.  It is a bonsai farm basically. From newer plants to ones that are decades old, this place has the largest collection you'll likely ever see and most of it is for sale."
"Quiet, peaceful",April 2016,40,Castellow Hammock Preserve and Nature Center,72janef,"It was locked when I got there even though the website listed it as open that time and day. Someone did answer the phone when I called and said I could park on the outside and walk in, also someone came to unlock it about 15 minutes later and I was able to park inside. There was nothing wrong with the restrooms and though no naturalist or volunteer was on site, I did get the trail guide and the trail is easy enough to follow if you navigate carefully over the roots and coral rock. This is a well known park among bird and butterfly watchers so happy that birds and butterflys have some natural habitat in the area. I recommend combining a trip there with other nearby sites if you are interested in the South Florida ecosystem."
Very good location ,December 2019,50,Beat Culture Brewery,kaalfo,Its all worth taking the way out to the airport
Great Brewery in Doral! Come have a few pints,May 2019,50,Beat Culture Brewery,feason99,"Beat Culture is a great addition to the Miami Beer scene. They have lots planned and from what you can already see and taste, they will not disappoint."
Surprisingly Good Beer and Grub,May 2019,40,Beat Culture Brewery,paddytale,"While staying overnight at the Days Inn in Doral, near the airport, we stopped in their lounge to check it out.  We were surprised to see it had a brewery and a good one at that.  We decided to eat lunch here while waiting for our room to be ready and we totally enjoyed ourselves.  The beer was really good and they make one heck of a grilled cheese sandwich too. The menu is limited but if you like ""comfort food"" there are some selections you might enjoy.  I recommend the smashed avocado with chips  for an appetizer to share.  Portions are good and everything was really tasty.  We came back later that night for a drink in the bar and the place was hopping with lots of great energy.  Friendly people and good beer at reasonable prices.  It's a winner!"
Hidden Natural Florida,June 2016,40,Castellow Hammock Preserve and Nature Center,MrMiamiExplorer,"I had not visited this preserve in a long time, and was eager to see if it has changed. Parking and admission were free. At the front entrance there are fields for recreation as well as a butterfly garden, and a small 1 room nature center. From the outside you may expect that the nature trail is short, but I was pleasantly surprised when I was still hiking an hour later. Be very careful not to get lost while hiking and always keep an eye out for the orange paint markings on the trees to help navigate your way out as the main trail sometimes disappears and other non-marked trails split off. I followed the paint markings on the trees and still ended up going in a circle at one point before I noticed familiar surroundings. Hiking boots are best as much of the trail is touch terrain of tree roots and jagged rock. There are is also a deep solution hole that you don't want to fall into. It is amazing to think that this escape from civilization is surrounded on all sides by farms and plant nurseries. As I walked through the ancient forest I could almost imagine encountering Native Americans or the Blair Witch. We observed a lot of wildlife during the 1 hour hiking the preserve including: zebra longwing and sulfur butterflies, mockingbirds, mourning doves, grackles, red bellied woodpecker, brown & bark anole lizards, gray squirrel, cottontail rabbit, golden silk spiders, pearl spiders, tree snails, ground snails, and unfortunately lots of mosquitoes. We will return."
Local Natural Park,September 2016,20,Castellow Hammock Preserve and Nature Center,growingbonkers,I'm not one for negative reviews but this park is best enjoyed by very local folks since there's not enough there for a long distance trek. The butterfly garden is all but non-existent and the hiking trail is closed off so it isn't a 1/2 mile as advertised. I didn't see many picnic tables but the rest rooms and meeting room was decent.  Not much to see but a fair amount of open area for family activities.
Go for the Hummingbirds -- come back for the marvelous experience.,March 2017,50,Castellow Hammock Preserve and Nature Center,Peter K,"We visited to see a couple of rare hummingbirds that normally are not seen in the Eastern United States.  The Buff-bellied and Rufous Hummingbirds were super, but our greatest memory of the visit was the amazing staff.  A young woman named Laura who works at at the park, came out when she noticed that we were in the butterfly garden.  She displayed an understanding of the special avian visitors in her park that I have never seen anywhere in the world.  She knew the personalities of the birds, their habits, exact movements, and precise locations.  Because of her warm, knowledgable, and expert assistance, we got great looks at all three species of hummingbirds that were there that day.  A truly memorable visit."
Awesome,June 2017,50,Castellow Hammock Preserve and Nature Center,EclipsianNight,"This place is...simply awesome. Our meetup group hiked there after visiting a fruit festival (Redland Summer Fruit Festival) in the area, and I must say, this place was simply delightful! The hike is not very long, but it is mighty interesting - full of curves and green limestone, which makes it quite the exotic little treat. The hike will take about 20 or so minutes - please wear proper hiking shoes and enough mosquito repellent. Since there are many curves and limestone rock, you must be careful to note where you step. There are some frogs/toads hopping away, so watch that you do not step on them! In one area, there is even a sinkhole enveloped by an enormous tree. Very spooky and picturesque. I would definitely go back to this little gem. The vegetation/forestry reminded me of being back home in CT, which was a very nice reminder. Go hike!"
Relaxed/Cool nightclub/bar,September 2015,40,Bardot,Nicholeth,"Good nightclub/bar, it is way bigger inside than you think. Its a good place to hang out with friends with a dance floor and pool table and good drinks"
Small spot but good music on certain nights,October 2015,30,Bardot,uberspeed,"Small spot but good music on certain nights, pool table in the back and some couches to lounge while you hear some beats."
This club is awesome!,December 2015,50,Bardot,blackluna27,The music is always phenomenal at this place! The dance floor is a little tight n the bar is always super crowded but they do have sexy waitresses to take care of you.  This is a great place with a chilled mixed crowd. Cover charges depend on the nights you go buts it worth it if you want somewhere cool to vibe in!
Anoraak,September 2016,50,Bardot,LenSabir,Drinking stella beer for 9$ now. Music sounds good so far
Amazing party,November 2016,50,Bardot,sylvain f,"Was there by french a guide book (Le Routard) recommandation, looking for underground club, with normal people enjoying nice music, and not a fake boring place as all tourist goes in SoBe. I had an amazing night time. Was by change a live show by famous DJ from Island GusGus. I even didn't know about them, but get in love of this music after the first set! Ambiance was crazy, everyone dancing and a real friendly ambiance. I meet some cool people and enjoyed my evening with them till 6am. Will for sure come again on my next stop to Miami. "

Nice Sound System and Sarah Packiam is Great!,July 2011,50,Bardot,A TripAdvisor Member,Definitely will see her again.  The sound system is studio quality which was real nice even in a packed house.
"Hip, cool, crazy place",February 2012,40,Bardot,Valux01,"I felt this was NYC in Miami.  Hip, cool, crazy place.  Packed.  Good music but a bit too heavy."
Velvet and Red,May 2012,40,Bardot,LulaBK,"I took a star away because there is a CORNBALL velvet rope , red carpet and bouncer charging a fee outside. LOL Cracked me UP. My bf happened to know the bouncer (really? A bouncer outside a spot that wants to be speakeasy?) and we didn't pay. Otherwise we wouldn't have gone in on principal. I mean-I don't pay to get in bars at home(Brooklyn). I'm gonna pay in Miami? Don't think so."
Hip,August 2012,50,Bardot,kendocubano,"Super hip site for live music. The bar is unmarked, and the doorman is great. Inside is like a hipster living room with bands, on the floor, an arm's length away. Seek this gem out"
Nice place to spend time with kids and family,February 2017,30,Palmetto Bay Park,clarar36,"It's always very clean and well maintained.  However, boys are no welcome there to play or practice baseball.  It looks like it's only good for girls to play softball. Nice place to throw a kids party. "
Great Park!,November 2018,50,Palmetto Bay Park,237anav,It's a great park with exercise equipment. Many activities are happening like the 4th of July celebration. 
Nice ,February 2018,40,Havana Nines,LollysLook,"This small airport boutique store, Havana nines had a nice variety of cruise and resort wear at its airport store. "
Great spot for a great festival,March 2017,50,Kenneth M Myers Bayside Park,TheChoclateFactory,"Been there for Ultra, so it doesnt really count as a park-review. It is more of a location review. My first time in Miami and this location is really one of the best places to have a festival. On one side you have the bay, with great yachts and on the other a great view of high rise hotels and other buildings. With an auditorium to finish it off. Great spot in Miami!"
Average ,April 2019,30,Kenneth M Myers Bayside Park,StephenCr0ss,Very old exercise equipment in the park. Feels unkept. Did not spend long as nicer parks to see. Not recommended 
Awesome Campus  and Sculpture Park!!,February 2018,50,Martin Z. Margulies Sculpture Park,Bubbyli2014,"the art work situated between the natural beauty of the palms and blue skies.  A feast for the New York winter eyes, but beautiful any time of year.  If you enjoy outdoor sculpture like seeing students happily engaged this is no miss opportunity."
Interesting,March 2016,50,Torch of Friendship,Nitin B,Simple and interesting. It is a good way to show your friends you love them by taking a photo with this monument. 
BEAUTIFUL MONUMENT DEDICATED TO FRIENDSHIP WITH THE PAN AMERICAN COUNTRIES !!!,June 2016,50,Torch of Friendship,Frank d,"I remember when this monument was dedicated to the Friendship with Pan American countries in 1960, and I was here when it was re-dedicated to President John F. Kenedy after his assassination in 1963. This monument hold many memories for me. It is a wonderful symbol of friendship among the people of the Americas."
Always promote Friendship!,April 2016,50,Torch of Friendship,TourGuide-Manager,"The Torch of Friendship on the right was dedicated by the city of Miami in 1960 to the everlasting friendship of our neighboring countries. The torch is the centerpiece of the memorial.   Behind the torch are plaques representing different countries.  On the farthest north end of the wall of plaques is the dedication of the memorial to the memory of John F. Kennedy, January 1964."
In memory of a friendly President,September 2016,40,Torch of Friendship,Betty P,"After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the monument was dedicated to his memory."
The Torch,April 2017,40,Torch of Friendship,Joe S,"It is a nice piece of History,Cold War.Miami is pan Americanism.Fidel Castro was the reason for this monument,in 1960, and many other communists were promoting anti-Americanism. Miami is much less Anglo today after these failed socialist paradises."
"Great basketball courts, good soccer and baseball fields.",March 2016,30,Ron Ehmann Park,Alfred R,"This is a very large Pineland style park. Their sports fields are well kept, but their bathrooms are dated and their jogging path is in need of physical repair. The kids playground does not have a canopy, like so many others, and the playground is old and n need of updates. They use to have exercise equipment, but they have allowed them to get old and broken down."
Nice Park,August 2016,30,Ron Ehmann Park,mwooduk,"Stopped by to get info on tennis lessons and walked around the park.  They have a soccer field (which was packed) and basketball courts, a kids playground and quite a few tennis courts.  Nice to walk around, lots of greenery"

"Clean, Convenient, A Good Way to Get Around to the Hot Spots in Miami without a Car",November 2018,40,Metromover,HarperVoyages,"It gets you from place to place in air conditioned comfort. Some of the units could use a little TLC, but that it true with any city's public transportation."
Worth a Ride!,May 2019,50,Metromover,Frqflier,"Was staying at the Brickell Hampton Inn.  Took the Metromover from beginning to end, goes in a giant loop.  Not exactly the fastest means of transportation, nor the biggest, but does what it's supposed to do in a town in which not a lot of people embrace mass transit."
A must!,December 2018,50,Metromover,EDLTraveller,This is a perfect way to see alot of Miami without even getting off the metromover! I suggest you stay on the first time and just look out the window and then start getting off at the stops and visiting the various areas. Very good service!
Miami Metro Mover,July 2019,50,Metromover,Elaine P,"Best thing ever!!! Free, safe, reliable and quick... loved it.  So easy to get from Downtown to Bayside"

Lush serenity a stone’s throw from the Convention Center,January 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,ladycheetah,"I just came back from the Botanical Garden and I love it there. If you treasure being in the natural world, this is a little oasis in a city environment. I love that you can call a phone number (local) and punch in the number of the species and you get information. The garden itself is well-cared-for and beautiful. It’s a great place to take a picnic lunch or hang out on a lounge chair with a book and chill for a while. "
A peaceful retreat,January 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Pat B,Nestled in between the giant convention center and the sober Holocaust Memorial is a small but very relaxing botanical garden with fish pond and many wonderful flowers plus tables and chairs to bring your lunch.

I first went in the evening after dark to attend a reception for a visiting artist and his exhibition. I decided to go back during the day and was impressed by all the beautiful tropical plants. There were spaces created for people to sit outside and relax. There was a group taking wedding pictures and some other visitors but it was not crowded at all. I saw several kinds of butterflies and a couple of large green iguanas walking around.  Inside the center was a gift shop; there was also a small nursery with orchids and other plants for sale.  To sum it up, it's a great place to spend a quiet afternoon in attractive surroundings."

An interesting Stop off if your passing by,July 2019,30,Little Havana,Camper826548,Stop here if your passing but I wouldn’t suggest going out of your way.
Cubans have it all!,July 2019,40,Little Havana,ravijawani,Would again again. 
Great way to travel,March 2019,50,Miami Trolley,Sirenita123,This is a free service covering South Beach. It is a great way to travel with numerous stops so that you do not have too far to walk. There is a route A and Route B and the services run approximately every 20 minutes. Clearly laid-out maps are at the trolley stops and the drivers are extremely helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed using this service.
Best bus service to get to know Miami!,December 2018,50,Miami Trolley,Geovana B,"Congrats, Miami! Best city ever! This service makes the tour around the city easy and pleasant. I recommend it!"
Depending on your driver -,March 2019,30,Miami Trolley,SUSANA E,For the most part the trolleys are awesome - just not enough of them and you cant depend on them - and then you have the rude drivers.  Some are nasty - play music so loud you cant hear anyone talk - I had one guy that we all asked him to lower his music scream at us - I think they fired him bc I havent seen him again.  thank God! - for the most part the drivers are friendly and helpful.
Great way to get around Miami,March 2019,50,Miami Trolley,deecg355,"We caught the Trolley in South Beach and tried to circle back around. It's a pleasant ride, especially after a hot day walking along the beach. The sidewalks can get a little crowed during the day. "
Britto Central is a must!,December 2016,50,Britto Central,taxesflorida,Go to Lincoln Road!  Not only check out all the stores but the Britto Central is real cool!   Highly Recommend!
A TRUE MIAMI STANDARD,January 2017,50,Britto Central,Marie K,"If you are not familiar with the works of Romero Britto, treat yourself to a visit to Britto Central.  Romero Britto is world renowned and has created works for the Olympics - Children's Funds - Sports - and now has multi-media works.  My gallery contact is Eduardo...he can help you begin your love for Britto!"
A Miami standard,February 2017,50,Britto Central,angelak336,I first heard about Britto in Miami. You can see his art in different parts of Miami. But in this gallery you can immerse yourself into his art!
Love Britto!,March 2017,50,Britto Central,Sandeelion,The two stores on Lincoln Road were such fun to shop in although I didn't buy anything because we would have had to have the items shipped. Something small would have been nice to pick up though. It was like going to a museum and watching the video about Britto himself was interesting. The original signed items are very beautiful and very expensive!
Looking for some colourful art!,March 2017,50,Britto Central,Wendy S,It's a must visit place in South Beach!
Great beach for a walk!,April 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,mrsclean58,"We took a couple of long walks on the beach.  Nice white sand, easy on the feet, not crowded in April.   Beautiful water.  It is a great place to go if you are looking to go for a walk or jog on the beach."
Six days of bliss,April 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,732robertac,"Hotel is fantastic.  Beautiful lobby, fabulous wine vault and bar.  Three terrific restaurants on premises including the restaurant at the pool.  Two pools (one for adults only).  Beach is gorgeous.  Gym is well equipped but small.  Rooms large and modern and amply stocked with bathroom necessities. Staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful  Shout out to Whilbert who works the pool service.  He is professional, polite, diligent and the absolute sweetest nicest guy. Will absolutely return to this hotel."
ONE OF THE BEST AREAS ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST !!!,June 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Frank d,"This area is very quiet compared to South Beach or any of the other beaches South of here. Beautiful shops, beautiful hotels, and beautiful quiet beaches. Paradise !!!"
walked from the  southernmost part to the northernmost tip of the city,October 2015,50,Bal Harbour Beach,ma d d,"I walked from the Sea View hotel to Haulover cut. it was blissfully quiet and fairly early in the morning with the sun shining illuminating everything in that special blinding yellow early morning light that makes you squint.  I think they have something like  vita parcours. really easy walking on paths bordered by grass and the water.  NO lifesavers on duty, so did not swim.   "
A relaxing morning,June 2016,40,Bal Harbour Beach,jmkn_12,"Coming from the west coast of Florida, I always enjoy the breezes of the Atlantic Ocean and the waves in the morning which are NOT too strong! Lovely sandy, well kept beaches."
Fantastic Art Deco Collection,November 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Franzi R,Loved exploring this museum! So many interesting pieces of art deco to explore - really helped me to understand Miami's architecture and unique style better.
"Amazing Collection, Free Admission on Fridays",November 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Susanne F,This Museum shows lots of Arts and everyday live stuff that explains a lot about the history of the time from the first WW till the 50s.
Unique Museum you'll love,November 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Ray A,"Anyone with the slightest interest in political history will be stunned by the fabulous collection.  Go see it....after all, the whole idea is, ""Never Forget.""  The dark side of humanity is spread before you in glaring shock, Go, take the kids, and never forget. "
A Must-See Museum for Art Deco Lovers,December 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,PhiladelphiaKaren,"This is a wonderful museum -- but not well-known to most art enthusiasts.  If you love Art Deco, do whatever it takes to get here!  The Art Deco collection is spectacular and unforgetable!  And you can take photos (no flash) so you will always have the memories of the amazing objects you saw.  I loved every moment of my visit and will always enjoy looking at my photos of the magnificent collection.  Don't miss it!"
Fascinating history of art deco in Miami - free on Friday ,January 2019,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,T L,This is a small museum which can be completed in an hour or so if you just want to look around and see the amazing collection.   However it was well worth going on the guided tour for the explanation of the history of specific items.   Enjoyed the experience immensely and strongly recommend that you visit. 
AMAZING!!!,November 2015,50,Fisher Island,HotelVista H,"This place is great to have a good time with family and friends. A paradise in the middle of the city, Full of story and luxury. For people who never have traveled to Miami before, it's an amazing experience, because there you can see how rich people live. It´s an interesting cruise."
Fisher Island,February 2016,40,Fisher Island,387indy,"You need to own or be invited to this barrier island. The houses and condo's are very expensive. If invited, its a 10 minute ferry ride from Miami; Of course you can use your helicopter or boat. The island is upscale for the rich and famous, they have tennis, a couple of restaurants, luxurious spa. Nothing is inexpensive."
"Family, Daughter's Engagement",March 2016,50,Fisher Island,LISAJ2552,"A wonderful place to stay and have a small family celebration.  The property is beautiful, and the food at all the eateries was very good and surprisingly not overly priced considering you are on Fisher Island.  I cannot comment on the hotel as we stayed with friends.    "
Luxury,October 2015,40,Fisher Island,ljstott,"Didn't actually make it ONTO the island, as it's invite only. However we took a little sightseeing boat tour around it. The buildings are beautiful, what a life hey if you have the money? I can only dream along with the rest of the peasants!!"
Pretty nice.... from far.,April 2016,50,Fisher Island,lindaferraz,"You can take a tour to view the island but cannot go in unless you’re invited in. You also have to go by boat or place, there are no streets to access it."
An experience that I'll never forget!!!,May 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,173catalinas,"We purchased the general admission, which was nice because you tour the place first and see other beautiful animals with a small group and a very nice guide. At the end of the tour you get to a pavilion where you can pet all the animals that are there; my favorite was petting the owl. Once this was over, I was ready for my encounter with Limbani! I can't explain what I felt; I was transported to another world! I got to play with him and pet him, and my husband and my son were there also taking videos and pictures so that I can cherish this fantastic experience for the rest of my life! We will come back. I highly recommend this place!"
ANIMAL HEAVEN,July 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Carolinalopez23,They have different tours to meet different animals <3
Great,July 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Joseph K,I have been to a lot of zoos but this was one of my favorite ones I have been to so far you can tell the staff and people really care about the animals and the animals are well taken care of. I would definitely recommend going here when you visit Miami.
It was amazing!!!!,July 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,805zhannak,"My 15 years daughter has a wonderful experience! Thank you so much your very professional staff and organization! My daughter love animals,she wants to be a veterinarian,it was so amazing! Chimpanzee Limbani so adorable,very friendly and very sporty boy.My daughter very happy to met him! Tiger cub Bharati so sweet baby also! Thank you so much Michelle and Jacob,assistants !"
Fantastic. Can’t wait until next year,December 2017,50,Art Basel,thomasoA2214PO,First time to Art Basel Miami. It was a great experience. I would stay in a hotel that is walking distance to the convention center. The quality and quantity of art work is superb and it is just a great venue. 
Art Basel,December 2017,50,Art Basel,387indy,"Miami-Dade County for an entire week, since 2002, December is home to the World's brightest artists. As art lovers converge, the graffiti talent comes out and paints Wynwood. Their are white tented art fairs, concerts, exhibits, and great roof top parties. The convention center, hotels, bars, and restaurants are packed. Entertainers, actors are everywhere."
Overwhelming experience,December 2017,50,Art Basel,Das4545,"Love it.  Hate it.  It gets all your senses working.  People from all over the world.  Huge crowds, crazy traffic.  An incredible sensory experience.  Huge display of stuff- some are art, some are not subject to categorization.  Everybody turns out.  Some beautiful people, and most not so beautiful.  It certainly stimulates the brain.  What does all of this say about society.  Where can art go from here.  Some junk, some beauty.  Something for everyone."
Must do event,December 2017,50,Art Basel,MarkVoto,Interesting art from around the world. If you don't have the time to travel all over then this is a place for you to come. Plenty of interesting art as well as people. 
Go Early and Enjoy the Visuals,December 2017,50,Art Basel,Sheryl B,"Wonderful experience, buy tickets on line. Go early if you are part of the public as it gets very crowded. Very large with lots of walking indoors, a great scene. Champagne by the glass is expensive but bar and other snacks reasonable. to sustain you for many hours of  beautiful and eclectic art.   "
A Shabby Chic Area,August 2017,50,Upper East Side,mmm129,"you get all types here, rich, middle of the road, and homeless vagabounds. the architecture is divine. i hope it doesn't change a lot. little haiti is fun, too."
Neighborhood Park,June 2015,30,Ronselli Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"Ronselli Park is located just adjacent to the Jorge Mas Canosa Youth Center. The playground is small, but is covered by a large tent like structure so the equipment is not burning in the sun, and provides cover from rain. There is also a basketball court and a standard baseball field. Nothing overly impressive, but average. Parking is free."
Good advice and airport directions,March 2018,50,Tourist Information Counter,Dwane M,Finding remote E terminal is a super challenge.  Thanks for directing me!  Hint:   Do not go through D concourse security to get to E concourse!
Stroll before Publix,August 2017,30,Briar Bay Park,mwooduk,"Got in 1,000 Fitbit Steps before going to Publix to go grocery shopping.  Grass needs mowing but hopefully the county will catch up soon!"
The Way a Neighborhood Park Should Be,December 2014,50,Continental Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"I had not been to Continental Park in many years and was interested to see how it's changed. In my opinion Continental park is everything a neighborhood park should be. Parking and admission is free. You won't find anyone in a guard booth demanding cash for admittance. There is plenty of open green space for recreational activities which is not enclosed by fences so neighborhood kids can just go and come as they please from the houses that surround the park. There is a soccer field, baseball fields, tennis center and courts, community center, playground, and walking paths. The walking path on the East side of the park by the tennis center goes through areas of preserved pine rockland and other native plants, where you can observe wildlife if you are lucky and quiet enough. In this area you can also observe the historical ""Dice House"" which is the oldest area building, having stood since the 1920's. If only all Dade and Broward County parks could follow Continental Park's example."
Worship in a Beautifu Historic Setting,August 2018,50,Plymouth Congregational Church,Barbara M,The  beautiful sanctuary of Plymouth Congregational Church is located just south of Coconut Grove on Main Highway.  The historic church made from coral rock is over 100 years old and is a much sought after setting for weddings.  The worship services at 10:00 am on Sunday mornings feature a welcoming atmosphere with excellent music and free child care.  Following the service refreshments are provided in the walled cloister garden.
Main reference library also lends books,September 2018,50,Miami-Dade Main Library,619jeffry,"This library is the main library for the Miami Dade library system, The library system has over 50 individual libraries which lend books, but this library has the best reference resources. It's a nice looking library, with genealogy and other specialist collections of interest to scholars and other library users It's okay just to look around. It's in the Government Centre in downtown Miami."
In a Sad State,June 2015,20,Chapman Field Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"I had not been to this park since I was little, so I was interested to see how it was changed. The park is located in a nice area surrounded by rich communities, but strangely, a garbage dump/waste transfer station is just steps from the park entrance.  Unfortunately I was shocked by what it has become. Both of the baseball fields were fenced off stating that it was temporarily closed for soil testing. I suppose like a few other parks in the Miami area they found heavy levels of toxins. The fields were so overgrown and untended due to the ""temporary"" closure they reminded me of baseball fields you might see on the Walking Dead. There is an unpaved trail you can drive, bike, or hike with leads through a mangrove forest down to the bay. Unfortunately the trail was so bumpy and muddy that I turned back after a few minutes. I didn't want to destroy my vehicle or ruin the alignment, as it was bouncing around as I drove. To make matters worse, the sides of my car got coated in mud, and I think I picked up a nail in my tire on that trail. If it wasn't so blazing hot and exposed, I might have hiked it instead."
I ALWAYS KNEW THIS PLACE AS THE BAHAMIAN CEMETERY OF COCONUT GROVE !!!,June 2016,40,Charlotte Jane Memorial Park Cemetary,Frank d,I have only been here once before some 50 years ago. This is a small cemetery that I believe was in use in the early 1900's by the Bahamian immigrants to South Florida. It is still a very nicely kept graveyard with much history of significance especially for the African American community here. As I understand it Michael Jackson was inspired by this place to film his Thriller Video.
Benise Concert was Outstanding,February 2016,50,Miami-Dade County Auditorium,Edmund438,"We attended The Benise Concert promoted by WPBT2.  Had VIP tickets which included a Meet and Greet from 5:30 - 6:30 PM to enjoy their rehearsal and then to meet Benise for discussions, photos, autographs before the 8 PM Show.  Am awesome and rewarding experience.  Their music and show is Spanish, Latin, Cuban, Italian and is a must see experience.  If you can't find his show near you, go to YouTube and search to enjoy on line."
Beautiful and Scary Park,August 2014,40,Kendall Indian Hammocks Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"I had last visited Kendall Indian Hammocks Park when I was little and was interested in visiting the next time I was in the area to see how it's changed. I was finally passing by this August of 2014 on the way home from an appointment. Entrance to this large park is free. The playground is shaded by beautiful oak trees and there is lots of space for recreation. The nature trail located at the center of the park runs through a beautiful lush forest with foliage so dense it reminded me of South American Rainforests. Unfortunately most of the vines are of non-native exotics. I observed squirrels, birds, and butterflies on the trail. The playground and picnic areas on the North East side of the park are well maintained. I would however suggest avoiding the West and South West sides of the park as they are VERY CREEPY! To elaborate: a grassy area on the West side of the park is used as a potters field by the Miami Dade County Medical Examiners Office to dispose of and bury unclaimed bodies. Public records have stated that at least 900 people are buried there in unmarked graves. The South side of the park has land that appears to have previously been part of the public park in the past, but apparently is now rented or sold to other organizations. I assume it is therefore no longer maintained by Miami Dade County Parks and Recreation. All of the picnic shelters in this area of the park have roofs that are caving in, some have been set on fire and are barely standing, and some have collapsed into piles of rubble and rotted wood. It reminded me of a playground from a post apocalyptic movie. I'm shocked that these dangerous old picnic shelters have not been removed by the County, regardless of whether it is their responsibility to maintain them. It also appears that nearby on the South side of the park, a section of land is used as a junkyard, repo, or tow yard for cars. I would suggest that all visitors enter and exit through the East side of the park to avoid these eyesores and creepy surroundings."
Nightlife Brewing at Marlins Park,June 2018,50,Nightlife Brewing,mybav1960," A couple of suggestions for you Joe...1. Put out a water cooler so people can get their own cold water (skip the water fountain)  2.  Put in more available outlets for people to charge their phones. 3.  Tell Juan to have a batch of his own ROOT BEER on tap for the kids.  That way,  everyone can have a brew before the game.  Otherwise you guys really have a great place!"
Phil's Berry Farm Homestead,October 2016,30,Phil's Berry Farm,eddiealva13,Overall nice plan for the family and little ones 
Excellent Banksy Exhibition in Miami,December 2018,50,The Art of Banksy,DavidT55,The most amazing collection of Banksy art works curated by Steve Lazarides. Really interesting audio tour by the curator is available. Fabulous ! Street work. Screen prints and more.  A great collection - the largest private collection ever gathered. Don’t miss this exhibition before it leaves town in February 2019.
should be called unauthorized banksy ripoff by steve lazarides,January 2019,10,The Art of Banksy,Gus M,"the parking lot was empty not even the MET MUSEUM in NYC. my visit to Florence Italy in May,2018 i paid 30 euros to see the DAVID @Academy Of Florence Art Gallery                                  / the Vatican city tour was like $30.00 so i just turned around got in my car and went to lunch. THE ARTIST HIMSELF SHOULD GET INVOLVED AND STOP THIS video on you tube under banksy ripoff"
Lots of open spaces ,July 2015,40,Bicentennial Park,tomhooves,Took the kids there and had a picnic under s tree. Tossed a ball about and had a nap. Very peaceful even though there were lots of people around
Nice park,February 2016,40,Bicentennial Park,Mark G,Bicentennial Park is located near the entrance to Bayside Marketplace and seamlessly runs into Bayfront Park.There is also a plaza with statues and history of the area.Nice open space.
A BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND PEACEFUL SPACE IN THE CENTER OF MIAMI !!!,June 2016,40,Bicentennial Park,Frank d,This is contiguous to Bayfront Park and the Marketplace. but it has it's own distinct flavor and character. This area offers different settings to different tastes all together in the same geographical vicinity.
Just about the neatest town in the MIami area,April 2012,40,Coconut Grove Bike Path,Marilyn M,"You MUST visit Coconut Grove on any trip to Miami.  Great restaurants and people watching.   Then hop on your bike and head south along Main Highway and jump on Old Cutler at the circle.  So, so picturesque."
Different world,October 2012,50,Coconut Grove Bike Path,Esha S,A fine setting of restaurants and night clubs all together. Interesting concept. If you wish to party or hangout with friends this is one place with loads of options. Good locality too.
Grest view whike out taking a ride,August 2014,40,Coconut Grove Bike Path,Natasha B,I loved the view. The children were able to ride there bikes without anyone rushing ir trying to bump them out the way.
Shortly to be changed for good,August 2015,20,Bicentennial Park,Tony053,The completion of the new Frost Museum of Science is going to be a huge improvement over this former empty lot. A place to be avoided until early 2017... 
It was alright,February 2017,40,Bicentennial Park,Jose S,"it's alright here, cool views around the area and right by the American Airlines Arena. This is where Ultra used to be back in the days. "
What a cool exhibit,February 2019,50,The Art of Banksy,711thea,"Never seen the original art of Banksy in the UK? Don't worry, this exhibit will come to you. Great original pieces along with some really interesting stories from the curator. The museum is cold so bring a sweater."
"Some interesting stuff, but hugely overpriced",January 2019,30,The Art of Banksy,SkinnycatYorks,"There's some interesting stuff here, although mostly limited edition prints. It's a really difficult (and odd) location though and seriously overpriced. If it hadn't taken us half a day to get there we wouldn't have bothered."
Delicious monkey bread and milkshakes,November 2016,50,Phil's Berry Farm,Fauricio E,Excellent service. Milkshakes are delicious and the monkey bread is one of the best. My kids had a good time.
Waste of money,September 2012,10,Miami Art Museum,Victel,"$5 parking and $8 each to see ONE ROOM of art. I say art but there were NO paintings, just a few photos and a couple of abstract pieces. We were out in 10 minutes. Don't waste your money. "
Nice Place,November 2012,40,Miami Art Museum,karen r,$5 parking and $8 each to see.
good choice for family trip,February 2013,30,Miami Art Museum,born2travelit,;-)
Not large but good South American art,March 2013,40,Miami Art Museum,DurhamAnne100,We asked about somewhere to have lunch and were directed over to the small Cuban cafe opposite where we had a very good meal and a warm welcome.
So small!,April 2013,20,Miami Art Museum,Lenore C,"I was shocked, as for as much money that Miami has, along with the high regard for appearances; this did not translate to a quality investment into the local arts.  The art museum is two floors, first floor modern, second floor Latin art.  That's it.  Perhaps I am spoiled, as I live in a city with a world renowned museum that is free, so having to shell out anything for this sad place was disappointing.  I recommend going next door to the History Museum, as there are a lot more interesting things to see."
Fun place to stop and have quality family time.,July 2017,50,Phil's Berry Farm,Ramblingwelove,"This is a family run business that cares about families. It's an open barn with picnic tables, checkers, dominoes, outdoor play area for young children, goats, tortoises and yes, great smoothies. You can buy fresh eggs from the chickens on their farm, monkey bread, snacks, jellies, hot sauces and they even had reading glasses. Just a nice place to enjoy time with family and friends. They also host birthday parties and are planning to start hosting weddings.   "
Great Strawberry Shakes,January 2018,50,Phil's Berry Farm,dman457,Owners are very nice. They will stop and chat with you.
Local Farm with playareas,March 2019,30,Phil's Berry Farm,OGSarahMarie,I was able to do everything in about 20-25 minutes as there’s not to much to over on multiple acres of space. Some of which is locked up and rented to other businesses in the area.
Happy Hour at NightLife,April 2019,50,Nightlife Brewing,juano992,"Came by once again just after work.  Within 15 minutes of Brickell.  Had a Once You Go, a double black IPA.  Great beer.  Also had an old standby, 90 Mile, an American pale ale.  "
Nice stadium bar ,July 2019,50,Nightlife Brewing,luegates,Went here before the Mets vs marlins game had a few beers great place to go before a game next time I go back to marlins park I’m definitely going there before the game 
Brewery tap room with nice atmosphere adjacent to Marlins Stadium,July 2019,30,Nightlife Brewing,Scott W,"Stopped by here recently.   It is a bit hidden but adjacent to Marlins Stadium right of NW 7 Ave.   Good selection of their own brews running from Sours to Pilseners, Ambers and Stouts.   Apparently they also have fish dip and chips but we didn't order any.   Flights of 4 are $12 and each pint we had was $7   It wasn't very busy when we were there but I am sure it is pre and post games.   Parking in garage next door is free for first hour, $1 per hour after.   Has about a dozen seats at the bar and some low tables.   Our server, Nico was very friendly and knowledgeable.   They do have limited distribution at some supermarkets (Milams) and at Total Wine.   The dark imperial ale and the stout were memorable, the other brews were a good standard selection but nothing really stood out for us."
Nightlife Brewing,October 2019,40,Nightlife Brewing,387indy,"Nightlife Brewing has an electric atmosphere especially during a gameday, its at Marlins park. The outdoor space alone is 2,000 sq ft. They have a good staff, a bar menu, good selection of beer."

"Permanent Exhibit Was Closed, Very Rude Security Guard",May 2012,10,Miami Art Museum,john33426,"There was no one in this museum and we found out why. Permanent exhibit was closed, when I asked how we could get up to the second floor, one of the guards said the exhibit was closed She was so rude and unprofessional, I then told her I was sorry I asked her a question . 8 guards watching us through the exhibit on records in three or four small rooms. No one else was in the place.No one was outside at the cultural center either. There were 2 cars in the parking lot. I'll never go back. Stay away!"
waste of  space,May 2011,10,Miami Art Museum,ilokanawalay,"I was very, very disappointed with this museum. being situated in a big city like  Miami, I expected more. I hoped to see works of great Latin artists or maybe a nice display of Latin culture-inspired works of art, but , instead, I saw random, poorly-selected works of random people that had no right to deserve the title ""skilled artist."" Sad for the artists who did a great job at creating pieces that showcased their skills that their works had to be placed alongside works of art that looked like they could be created by a kid in kindergarten. And, the museum only had two floors of exhibit. In a way, I am glad there were only two floors. Imagine paying for an admission fee only to see crappy art. People of Miami deserve better. I would not recommend a visit to  this museum to anyone."
Pleasant Pieces of Art,March 2011,30,Miami Art Museum,AFelix2322,This museum is a very small one with two floors. The first floor is very impressive with its painting but the second floor I was not as interesting. The second floor is mostly filled with artifacts from Miami. Cool but not very impressive. I may have spent an overall hour in this museum discussing the art work on the first floor. Very quiet and empty. The workers were nice and polite. I enjoyed myself and it left an impression on me.
good,March 2011,30,Miami Art Museum,c d,"I just wish it would not make families so monitored!!!!!!!!!!!! I understand some people do not take care of their kids, but I do and it was tensed!"

Nice Exhibitions & Selection of Art,January 2016,40,Miami Art Museum,dwh6776,"Currently, the museum is featuring the People's History of South Florida which is a great way to learn about this unique region without spending months of study. The presentation is well-arranged and covers all the significant periods of South Florida's history. The permanent art display is equally impressive with good representative pieces of all the major periods. Certainly this venue is worth your time as a break from the beach or on a rainy day.

"Great location, badly needs some TLC!",June 2016,10,Chapman Field Park,183glennb,"It looks like at one point the county was putting some money into developing this park but that stopped long ago and most of the park is closed ""temporarily"".  Another visitor posted a similar experience a year ago.  There is a canoe and kayak launch (no motorized boats are allowed)  but the mangrove trail leading to the bay has become almost impassable. Is a machete not in the county's budget?  This place should be filled with visitors but sadly it was all but deserted the day I visited."
Kayaking ,July 2016,50,Chapman Field Park,Jason A,"This place is very nice for kayaking or canoeing. When you pass the ball fields go down the dirt road and you will get to the launch, which is nice. You have two trails. One goes East to the pond, I perfer going to the west which will take you to though a trail that goes under a bridge  which will go to a big Lake with a mangrove island in the middle which is beautiful nice and, open and peaceful nice fishing too. Then keep to the right there is another trail which has an amazing  scenery,the wild life is awsome. Saw lots of pretty, and exotic birds. Different types of lizards, lots of fish . Then it will open to the bay where you can fish for hour or snorkel. It is a must do if you like nature. "

Libraries in Miami - Lots to Love!,September 2019,50,Miami-Dade Main Library,Annalisad65,"I am a huge fan of Miami-Dade Public Library System. I belong to two book clubs and most of the books I read are from the library. MDPLS has an excellent selection of books, including recent releases in all its libraries. Ordering a book is easy and the wait is usually short. My local library is Lemon City where the staff are always 100%. Friendly, helpful and eternally in good form. It’s a pleasure to go there, conveniently located two blocks west of Biscayne Blvd., with ample parking on the streets if the lot is full. I’ve taken free Spanish lessons at the Westchester library and have enjoyed workshops and music performances at several libraries throughout the city and Miami Beach over the years. I go to the Main Library from time to time, usually to see an art exhibit-there’s a fine space upstairs that showcases beautifully. Recently I attended a GMD workshop and this past Saturday, the Local Author Fair. It was a wonderful event and I had the opportunity to meet several local authors including Seth Bramson, Craig Pittman, Maika Moulite, Maritza Moulite, Tamara B. Rodriguez and more. South Florida has a treasure trove of talented writers. The event included live music performances and started on time with remarks from Ray Baker, Director at Miami-Dade Public Library System who thanked everyone for attending, encouraged all to get library cards and thoughtfully acknowledged the staff who worked tirelessly to pull this event together. Keynote speakers were Craig Pittman and Edwidge Danticat and both did entertaining, and in the case of Ms. Danticat, heartwarming PowerPoint presentations. Books & Books was on hand selling local authors’ books. I picked up several and wished I got more! The Main Library is located on the plaza level of the Miami-Dade Cultural Center along with HistoryMiami Museum on West Flagler Street. (The Cultural Center is a striking, fortress-like complex, designed by Philip Johnson, in the early 1980s in the heart of historic downtown Miami steps from the Metromover). Highly recommended getting a library card and spending a couple hours in this lovely library or indeed any branch around the city and county."
Nice walking trail and tennis courts,April 2018,40,Continental Park,mwooduk,Came by here after work to walk and get some fresh air after being shut in an office for 9 hours!  I had forgotten what a pleasant park this is and only recently rediscovered it after trying a different route home to avoid the ridiculous Miami rush hour traffic.  Really enjoyed it and good to see the tennis courts being used and so much parking availability.
It's very nice during the day,October 2017,40,Briar Bay Park,terrenomar,"If you frown on having homeless people scare the poops out of you do not go at night. While they may be harmless, you won't know their even there till one smiles at you. By then you're walking away and out to your car making any chances of a romantic walk with your date a total loss. I will say this, if you have a keen sense of smell you will know what to expect. The park is small but nice and the children's area is very nice with plenty of shade from mature oak trees. Bring some lunch, bring some friends and if you have something you like to throw around bring that to."
Needs clean up post Irma,October 2017,30,Briar Bay Park,mwooduk,Lots of trees down following Hurricane Irma - the county finally cleared the place up and it's ready for walking again :-)
Ok still needs some work ,March 2018,30,Briar Bay Park,mwooduk,Came to this park for 10 minutes as I was early for a meeting. It's located right behind the publix at Briar Bay. It does have a playground and a small walking trail and there's always people in there using it. It's nothing to write home about but it's nice for a shortstop
Finally repaired after Hurricane Irma :-),May 2019,50,Briar Bay Park,mwooduk,So it took 18 months since Hurricane Irma but kudos to our local authorities for doing a great job in finally fixing up our local park!  New playground looks great and the wall murals are inviting. 
It may seem weird but I love this airport.,May 2018,50,Tourist Information Counter,suespagnuolo,Every time we fly into or out of Miami International Airport I find something more to love about it.  The airport is BEAUTIFUL and so well cared for and clean.  Everyone is so nice and polite and helpful.  It's a  huge airport but everything is well marked and easy to find IF you pay attention to where you're going.  We've gotten on the wrong tram before but that was our fault.  An employee was very helpful with directions.  The only rude encounter was with the parking attendant in the exit booth.  He must not like his job.  Poor fella.
Great for a morning or evening walk or stroll,February 2015,40,Coconut Grove Bike Path,ShellFos,I love coconut grove.  Whether you are a sailor or a senior this quaint community will make you feel at home compared to other more lux areas of Miami.  This bike bath is great for a morning stroll with a coffee or an evening jog.  I felt safe always.  
This is offically called the Underline Park....,January 2016,40,Coconut Grove Bike Path,Oldmaster,"This Park is located along US 1 from Downtown Miami to Kendall and follows under the Metro Rail. Right now its just a path way running under the train tracks with some landscaping, but future plans have this being developed into a first class park. Eventually this Park will join other parks in Miami for one big Green Experience."

Foliage from all over the world is grown here; it is truly fascinating.  Take the tram ride (they go once an hour) and each driver/guide teaches us something new.

Final Visit,March 2019,40,Flea Market USA,William B,I wanted 2 C the place one last time B 4 it closed it's doors 4 good.  I only had been here twice in the past and I was always impressed with the merchandise the vendors sold a very good prices and I really like the food as well.  I really hated 2 C this place close but I believe the property was sold and it's really a shame because the place was always busy.  I liked the area even though it wasn't in the greatest part of town because of the passenger train station.

Heaven Sent,August 2018,50,Spanish Marie Brewery,HR00917,"For half my life I've lived in the West Kendall area and have always had to drive 20-30 minutes to find a good bar or brewery. This place is heaven sent. The staff is awesome and most importantly the beer selection is great. The location is not the biggest but it's very cozy and they manage the space well. They dont sell food but you're more than welcome to bring your own food. I highly recommend ""The Kings Peach"" or Clown Shoes Mango"". Overall this has been a blessing and welcome addition to the Kendall area."
So Glad I Discovered This Gem!,February 2017,50,La Isla,lmcuadra007,"This shop in the heart of Little Havana is absolutely wonderful!  The items are original, of excellent quality, and reasonably priced.  The owner is delightful and doesn't pressure you to buy anything.  I bought a very cool and beautiful Frida Kahlo t-shirt.  The store is small, but I could have stayed there for hours looking at every one of the items.  Loved it!"

Love this opera company,March 2014,50,Florida Grand Opera,salartist1,"Thais was so beautiful , the music stayed with me for days. This year I have been to young artist performances, artist talks, and after performance interactions with singers, set designers and management, as well as all the operas. This company is one of America's truly great bargains."
La traviata.,May 2014,40,Florida Grand Opera,GianniB501,"I had the opportunity to be at FGO many times, unfortunately some time shows aren't at the high level we can expect. But I suggest to have the experience if you want to spend a night with classic music."
It doesn't get better than this!,December 2014,50,Florida Grand Opera,Printer1215,The venue (Arsht Center) is also great-- it's fun to make a dinner and opera evening out of it.
Great place,January 2015,50,Florida Grand Opera,mark d,"Great place to visit when in town. I really enjoyed myself and will be back. The place is busy so worth getting a seat as early as you can. We were in a group of 12, and it wasn't possible for all of us to be seared in one row which was unfortunate."
Beware of Sixt,September 2019,10,Sixt Rent a Car,David G,"We had many issues with this company while renting a car to attend a funeral, but I’ll just mention three items to give you an idea what you’d be dealing with if you rented from Sixt.  The shuttle driver was on his cell while driving on multi lane highway. Which is illegal in DC where we were renting.  It took 1 hour 25 minutes to process our advance reservation (There was only one couple in front of us). Another 20 minutes to be given the car.  And finally,  they’re harassing us to collect our insurance details to open a claim for a slow leak from a nail in one of the tires. What’s relevant to this issue is that there’s a renovation going on at Sixt, and the dumpster for the gutting of the space is in the same location as where the cars are dispatched from.  So they’re most likely responsible for the puncture and it’s not even clear that the car was my responsibility when the puncture occurred.  Furthermore, it’s less than $20 to repair a puncture. Probably less than that for them to fix since they have someone on staff for small issues.  So why are thy trying to get my insurance details for what they are writing up as an “accident”.  They’ve asked me if I called the police to have a report made.  Gathered witness statements. And more.  For a puncture.  Beware of this predatory business."
Sixt in Agudilla Pr,September 2019,20,Sixt Rent a Car,co1rivera,"This company was not prepared for business on the Friday we arrived. There were no cars available even though i had reservations. I had to wait about 45 minutes for a rep to drive 3 minutes to the airport and bring a car for us to use. Other customers were referred to dollar rental for a car. So, after the car was washed, dried and vacuumed at 4am we were able to continue with our vacation."

SIXT CAR HIRE LONDON ,September 2019,10,Sixt Rent a Car,Fclaw,Very dishonest people and outfit!
Overcharged,September 2019,20,Sixt Rent a Car,Alexander L,"Rented the car from Ft. Lauderdale Airport facility. We paid for an E class Mercedes up front but when we got to the checkout they requested a $1,000 deposit on top of what we already paid. We refused to pay that amount for a deposit so our only option was to pay $500 deposit for a lower class model (GLA). When we returned the car they overcharges us almost $100. Turns out they charged us for not bringing the car back with a full tank, even though we filled it up before returning it. Had to speak with a manager to remove the charges for the gas and adjust the price for a lower class vehicle."
I will never rent a car from SIXT!,October 2019,10,Sixt Rent a Car,Jane Susan G,"This is not about the Miami location, but about the company in general. Everything is done online. I reserved a car for my trip to Chicago, and then I tried to cancel; it was not at the last second, but a week ahead of time.I learned I would be charges for 3 days even though I had not even driven. No car rental company - not Hertz, or Avis, or Enterprise, etc - does this. Sixt said: this is our policy. But it's a BAD policy! No amount of reasoning and logic worked on them. You would think a company would wish to ENCOURAGE a first-time user to stay loyal. No! Their policy is more important. So I said, if you do this to me I will leave negative reviews on social media. They didn't care. So, profit from my mistake and DO NOT USE SIXT CAR RENTAL! EVER!"

Amazing beers in south west Kendall in low key location,September 2018,50,Spanish Marie Brewery,Scott W,"Finally had a chance to go here on a Sunday.   It is located in a strip mall at one side of the Tamiami Airport (near a church so parking on Sundays can be difficult).   They have  15 of their own brews plus 5 or so guest brews, two wines and soft drinks.   The brewmaster was working the bar, Jaime and he helped us select what we wanted.   Flights can come up to six beers and are priced at the 5 oz rate (about $3.50) for each beer.   Pints run in the $7 and $9 range.    Between the two of us we tried almost everything and liked every beer.   Jaime seems to have a magic touch at blending different ingredients and flavors so they are all present but don't overpower each other or leave an aftertaste.   The fruit infused beers (mango, passion fruit and guava) were great as was the French Vanilla Coffee porter (#10).   I wish they had some red/amber beers.   The two brown ales were amazing.   Being a Sunday they had wings for sale and the Fins game on the huge TV screen.   This place seems to have a regular crowd and it is dog friendly.   They only opened in May and don't have much distribution worked out yet so I hope they last as their selection and quality of beers is phenomenal.   Open at noon on weekends and 4 pms during the week.   Beers are discounted $1 I think during happy hours and Fins games.   The place is small with about 10 stools at the bar and half a dozen tables or so seating 4.   They are working out the kinks to have a food truck nearby, otherwise no food (except wings they had for the game).   I think this place can get noisy since it is small and with high ceilings.   They use a 7 barrel brewing system.    Music is there but not too loud.  Will definitely go back as Jaime mentioned they are always trying new brews."
Great new expansion behind old location with amazing craft beers,September 2019,40,Spanish Marie Brewery,Scott W,I am really pleased Jaime and Alberto took the big step to expand and the quality of their beer and the improved environment will hopefully work out for them.   I'll be back!!!
"Great space, nice beer, bit pricey ",September 2019,30,Spanish Marie Brewery,andresn308,I would come back during happy hour!
The Joy of Live Major Opera,October 2012,40,Florida Grand Opera,friedkin,"The Miami Opera is neither the Vienna Staatsoper nor the NY Metropolitan but it rocks. I saw in October a ""Magic Flute"" that rivaled my memory of the Chagall ""Flute"" that opened the first season of the new house for the NY Met. I've heard young singers like Ailyn Perez and Eglise Gutierrez who performances have a place in my great musical memories like Stratas or Price. Because I once disappointed with a performance of Turandot, I missed what friends have told me was an unforgettable Walkyrie."

SIXT Rental Cars are a FRAUDULENT Nightmare. SCAM! FRAUD! AVOID!,August 2019,10,Sixt Rent a Car,Daniel G,"When I returned from my trip, I found my credit card charged $192 for the lost key (fair enough), but an additional charge was made for $586 for a scratch that I was not notified of, and had absolutely nothing to do with. I was also charged an extra day charged. They provided no evidence of damage until I appealed (twice). I was later supplied with low resolution photos taken with flash at night of the car, and photos of a scratch - location on the car and size undisclosed. Their email said the car was towed rather than opened because the parking brake had been ""engaged on the hill"". The car was left on the flat at the ferry dock in P (no additional brake). They said they would open the car with the help of a local dealer, but subsequently communicated it had been towed (which could well have scratched the vehicle. No notification, no repair quote, nothing until queried. If I hadn't checked my statement carefully, they would have slipped it past my attention.  Single day rental, total charges now exceed $900. Suffice it to say I wish I had selected a US company. The company has thus far failed to concede a single error on their account. DO NOT USE SIXT CAR RENTAL UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO PAY THE SAME FOR A DAY AS FOR AN TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT."

I've booked AUTOMATIC car on the website.  Conveniently enough for them, there is nothing on the confirmation that states that the booked car is automatic.  Of course, when it's time to pick up the car, they tell me I've booked manual.  Oh, but obviously they don't have the same class automatic in stock, so I must upgrade to a luxury car or wait and see how long it takes them to locate a car of same class."

We told them we had driven two and a half hours just to get there and they lightened up a bit."
Not really a deal,October 2018,10,Duty Free Americas,Colin F,"I picked up some perfume and scotch here on the way through MIA and found that it's actually MORE expensive than in Toronto! Considering that there's about 80% tax and or profit on these items in Ontario, you'd think that a duty free in the US would be much less but it's not. They're also very eager to get your personal info and credit cards. I'd avoid these guys and the airport should also reduce the amount of retail so you don't have to walk miles and miles--or--install some more people conveyor belts!"

DO NOT RENT FROM THEM,June 2019,10,Sixt Rent a Car,MKBG,"It's hard to even give them 1 star. This company is awful. It is very difficult to get through to them to reach an actual person if you need to speak to someone. We needed to cancel a trip and it would not work online so we had to call and speak to someone. They told us to first re-book, and then they would refund the previous amount. (several hundred dollars). Two weeks later, we still did not have a refund. We called again. They said ""it went through on our end, check with your credit card company"". They refused to provide us with any type of confirmation of the refund, and said that AMEX doesn't do that. (which makes no sense!) They have given us the run around so many times and we truly feel they are a very deceitful company. We have called and emailed multiple times. We have asked to speak with a manager. Nothing has been resolved. They won't answer emails and a manger won't contact us. We finally turned it over to our credit card company to deal with. The sad part is that they lost a good customer (one that rents cars A LOT). I will NEVER ever use them again, and I will make sure that others know they are not honest and reputable."
Great rate and fantastic car - love the location,April 2019,50,Sixt Rent a Car,Phattymack,There was no charge to drop the car in Ft Lauderdale which was amazing as I had a cruise to catch. They had ample shuttles and took me right to my ship at no additional charge. I would not rent from anyone else in south Florida.
TOTAL SCAM. Run and rent from a reputable company,August 2019,10,Sixt Rent a Car,kellydW7560EN,"I could not have imagined a pure scam could continue to operate, but it does. After booking through Priceline, we arrive at the Las Vegas Sixt Rent a Car. My husband and I have one account with two cards. As I usually book vacations I did so using my card. So they tell me he cannot drive because I booked with a card not in his name. I finally said okay then I’ll drive. Then they said no, you already listed him as a driver. I said okay fine change that. No they can’t. I said what do we do? He told me he had cancelled my booking with Priceline and to give him my husbands card and after a $500 deposit and over $300 because there is a new price now, they would rebook. I repeatedly asked if I will get my refund from Priceline, and he said yes. Priceline has since said that is not true, they do it issue cancellation or refund, that Sixt would have to...I then asked for a receipt or proof of cancellation and he refused. I pressed him and asked why won’t he show me proof he cancelled so he just looks at me with guilt all over his face.  I then became suspicious and told him there’s no way without a receipt or proof I will be refunded for the booking though Priceline am  I’m letting him charge our card. He refuses. So we were stranded. We walked with our luggage back to the airport, went to NATIONAL CAR RENTAL. It was quick and easy to book a brand new car with no hassle and ZERO deposit. Please save yourself by going to a reputable place like National. Thanks to National we ended up having a fabulous vacation. No thanks to Sixt we are out of $300 they completely stole from us. As I was sitting there I saw a similar sensor happening over and over to customers. I don’t know how these employees sleep at night after a full day of scamming customers. Don’t use Priceline either as they will take no responsibility when things go wrong. I really wish I had seen all these bad reviews before I booked. THEY ARE ALL VERY ACCURATE."
Great venue; fabulous entertainment,February 2012,50,Florida Grand Opera,SRVP,The Adrienne Arsht Center is a world class performing arts facility. It is modern in design and has fabulous acoustics--one of the nicest opera venues we attend and we have seen many around the world. The Florida Grand opera which performs at this venue is a terrific company with high quality performers and excellent choices of operas. Even for those unfamiliar with the librettos can enjoy because the lines are projected overhead in English and Spanish.
Poor fraudulent service,November 2019,10,Sixt Rent a Car,Andrijana B,"It is a very bad service, if you happen to get someone.  My suspicion is that they are having many problems and might not exist for long.  I am sorry now I did not read any reviews before booking them."
Ridiculous,December 2019,10,Sixt Rent a Car,trackgrp,In line to pick up car rental for an hour. 1 employee at Tampa airport.  Line has 5 groups behind me.  Asked employee get some help.  Quote I'm alone
Fantastic service fantastic service,December 2019,50,Sixt Rent a Car,LouiseRytz,Very serviceminded staff at Miami Airport and in F:t Lauderdale we had a fantastic car. Chrysler 300 you must try it

Bravo!,November 2011,50,Florida Grand Opera,domsis,Saw Luisa Fernanda on opening night.  Absolutely magnificent.  The opera house is beautiful and easy to get to.  
outstanding rigoletto production,January 2012,50,Florida Grand Opera,MIAMISHEILA,"Beautiful music,voices, sets, and costumes, performimg one of Verdi's classics. FGO puts on lovely productions."
Operas are terrific.,January 2012,50,Florida Grand Opera,Flo-NewRo,"They do some unusual onesas well as the most popular,  All first class."
Cultural asset,November 2011,40,Florida Grand Opera,MarineroM,"Quality productions, good voices, excellent Opera House; Very good over-all entertainment experience"
Good young singers,May 2012,50,Florida Grand Opera,divingprofessor,"  FGO often tries new or obscure operas. Last year's Cyrano de Bergerac was one of the very few new operas really worth seeing.  I found the year before's Anna Karenina rather dull. The year before that, perfect stageing and excellent singing managed to make Szulamit interesting."
Good Sounds,September 2016,40,Klipsch Amphitheatre at Bayfront Park,Christina C,"We saw the Goo Goo Dolls who had 2 opening groups before them.  The sound system was very good.  My seat broke in the middle of the concert, but by that time, everyone was standing anyway.  The venue is clean, neat and tidy.   There are plenty of staff to help you find your seat or answer questions. They have paramedics on hand to help passed out customers (which happened that night) It has several food trucks and cocktail stands.  One small gin and tonic costs $12.00, a little high, but it is Miami after all.  Next concert I attend there will probably be in the winter, instead of when it's 95 degrees at night!"
Awesome Venue for Concerts - One of The Best Anywhere,August 2016,50,Klipsch Amphitheatre at Bayfront Park,James C,"We saw The Cure perform in concert at the Bayfront Park Amphitheatre on June 27, 2016. I had never been there but I'll definitely be back! It's an awesome venue for an evening/night concert. The sound is outstanding, it's comfortable and the surrounding scenery is perfect for a Miami concert."
"Great venue for a concert, as long as the weather agrees",August 2017,40,Klipsch Amphitheatre at Bayfront Park,jilejon,"The sound was great during the concert, even with the rain. Seats assignments were easy to find."
Concert,September 2018,40,Klipsch Amphitheatre at Bayfront Park,yourhelpfulfoodie,We had a good time in here. They have the stage and some chairs in front of it for whoever buy tickets with assign seating. The rest of the people can seat on the grass. You can take your own chairs and blanket or rent them over there. The light on the stage at night were beautiful and even though I did not expect it the sound was superb. The only thing i didn't like was the parking because I had to pay $25. Everything else's was good. It's a very fresh and romantic place !
Great Customer Service,May 2018,50,Ron Jon Surf Shop,Globetrotter08uk,Fabulous shop and service. Thank you- we look forward to planning our snorkelling adventure!
Seminar,September 2015,40,Miami Ironside,226vivians,Will return to explore the stores.
Authentic ,February 2016,40,Miami Ironside,envy4u,Shady area but get beyond the neighbourhood. Once you enter the restaurant it is trendy and hip. Staff helpful. Pizza authentic Italian. Best part BYOB with no corkage fee.  Reasonably priced food. Will return and recommend. 
Milan meets Miami,September 2016,50,Miami Ironside,Jeffrey H,The best Italian food in Miami.  Wonderful bespoke shops.  Parking is easy and plentiful.  They are doing a wonderful job with Ironside.  GO!
A must seen in Miami,January 2019,50,Miami Ironside,David B,"Iron side is an amazing place, a hidden gem with curated stores, amazing pizza place, and having pièces of the Berlin wall in the garden makes it even more special "
"The Opera ""Norma""",January 2016,50,Florida Grand Opera,Mermaid781,"My friend invited me to see the Opera at the Arsht Center in downtown Miami. I had not gone for years and she had a wonderful ticket in the orchestra section where we heard a fantasticscore of music for the opera ""Norma"". I did not know much about this but was so pleased it was a fantastic performance with very strong voices and the lead Norma played by Mary Elizabeth Williams was incredible. Her range and strength and stamina was unforgettable. The nice part about this was before the opera  we are given an overview of it, if you arrive early at 7 and then after the performance we are invited to stay and talk with some of the actors. It found it so exciting and enlightening. Norma was quick moving, a love triangle tragedy, but very well done by all. Can't wait to see other operas as well. The conductor Anthony Barrese, was very passionate and made the music soar...an added plus. A wonderful night out!"
Great Opera Experience,May 2017,50,Florida Grand Opera,359randyc,"The FGO has done an amazing job. If you can go, do it. A great way to spend an evening."
Proud to have this in our community,May 2017,50,Florida Grand Opera,792andrewj,"FGO has become an important name in regional opera. The quality of performers and performances has only improved over time, and their outreach in the South Florida region--not just Miami--has been steady. I look forward to more performances from this great arts company."
Beautiful Musical Experience!,November 2017,50,Florida Grand Opera,Gilberto O,"If you are an opera lover or just wish to have a full understanding of the performance, you MUST show up an hour before the curtain rises to listen to Mr. Justin Moss. He gives a very complete narrative and explanation of the Opera being presented. His love for this art form is undeniable, while his understanding and knowledge of opera, diction and presentation are nothing short of first rate. Very strong recommendation. The whole thing is truly a beautiful musical experience."
Salome. ,January 2018,30,Florida Grand Opera,359randyc,"While I am a big supporter of the Florida grand Opera, I was not satisfied with this performance."
Hot stuff ,March 2015,10,Bayshore,John G,"We went big game fishing in the beautiful coconut grove bay shore landings with this boat and skipper/ owner all I can say is what a wast of money £1.200. Plus 200 dollars tip we were told we had to give it was expected from you we gave it to him hoping it would go to the two deck hands what a bad skipper rude unhelpful and down right nasty to his deck hands and really had a bad days fishing not one fish caught in eight hours !,, he just could not be bothered so if you do want to do some big game fishing don't go with this boat it's a total wast of money !"
A nice place to be lost...,August 2015,40,Bayshore,RetiredCPA2003,"We spent a bit of time in Coconut Grove as lost tourists. There seemed to be construction everywhere. When we found Bayshore, we were able to get back on track."
Beautiful place!,September 2015,50,Bayshore,JrDurando,"This a good place for a morning walk. The ocean view, the boats, the garden around. The walk road is good for exercise. "
Just hang out and relax at our most beautiful and hip parks in Miami...,September 2017,50,Bayshore,josephsK1310ZW,"Bayshore Drive is known for its mad traffic during rush hour (pretty much from 6am to 8 pm, lol) , but to us locals it is also home to some of Miami's most beautifuil, hip and historic parks in Miami and all of South Florida: Kennedy Park (beach volleyball) , Peacock Park (skateboard park and lots of ball fields), and the Barnacle Historic State Park...all with gorgeous views of Biscayne Bay and amazing chilled vibe. A FREE day of utter R&R, exercise or whatever for all. Sunbathe, play sports, or just people watch, all with some snack and food options nearby. Parking usually not a problem either...YOUR WELCOME!!!"
Local Maimi ART,July 2016,50,Effusion Gallery,tinsleyelizabeth13,"We went in to take a peek and left with 4 very neat pieces! The staff was so helpful and friendly! They told us so much about what was behind the art and the artists. Every piece had a story to tell and there were also some very unique pieces. We bought a very cute bag, 2 triple layer glass pieces one called raining men and the other the fiddler on the roof. My favorite piece that we bought was John Lemon! I found it very amusing. The best part was that they helped us ship one of the pieces overseas as a gift right from the store with the details on how much it would be and everything. Insurance included! They even gift wrapped it very beautifully! I was very pleased with my visit."
Nah,July 2017,10,Effusion Gallery,Gu1otta,"To be honest, I loved this store. This is our third year coming to Miami for summer vacation. Every year I go to Effusion to buy something or at least see what's new. Tonight was very unsettling. My wife & I walked in to look around, literally the first store we have walked into since we got here. I noticed the older lady working seemed to be following me. I didn't pay it any mind. Suddenly, she disappears & peeks around the corner at me! There are plenty of people in the store at the time but for some reason she's targeting me. Mind you, I am wearing a short sleeve shirt & gym shorts. I don't know what she thought I was going to steal. At this point, I'm pretty offended & feel very indignified. I came there to buy my 2 sons something for their bedrooms, not this. I find my wife & tell her I'm ready to go. As I'm passing by the counter, I see the lady on her laptop looking at past surveillance footage. I didn't touch a single thing the whole time I was there. I didn't deserve this & I will never be back."
Great gallery with lots of colorful miami style art,November 2017,40,Effusion Gallery,Jeff K,"Nice Gallary with lots of colors, Britto, Napoleoni type styles. Gallery make you walk away happy. Has a lot of modern art from originals to prints. All sort of price points. Really worth a visit if you are into art. Close to beach"
Lovely little gallery with incredible art!,April 2018,50,Effusion Gallery,Annie C,"I could have spent hours in this lovely little art gallery, such amazing art work! Great location also, easy to just pop in."
Very cool and colourful,July 2018,50,Effusion Gallery,Sam S,Very cool little gallery with so much in there. Some beautiful things and some very funny and clever pieces. Definitely worth checking out
Fascinating oasis,March 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Colette P,I would recommend this outing for a nice afternoon.
Great shopping venue!,September 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,gonz1974,"I’ve been a couple of times to this outlet and this is a fantastic venue to do my shopping. I have a couple of kids and this mall has all the major brands at a discount price for everyone in the family. It’s conveniently located close to the airport, doral and coral gables. The distribution of the stores is also very practical, as it groups stores per “type of customer” or mission of purchase. It has excellent food options and the restrooms are clean. I prefer it to sawgrass."
Something for everyone in the family,October 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,rliriano,Enjoy all the venues this great Mall has to offer.
Great place to shop and eat!,September 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,cecirosanes60,I was there for a business lunch and as I waited I looked around hoping area and saw great stores. I did not buy anything but did see lots of great stores.
Good selection of shops but don’t take luggage!!,October 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,Graham_Duncan86,Shops were good though and that’s what matters :)
Huge mall,October 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,Sayeedac1,"Lots and lots of shops. It's a huge shopping center with with several wings, under one roof. Pleasant to be inside & walk around away from the heat outside. Sitting arrangements all over the mall. Many eateries. Lots of visitors even on a weekday. "
Good transport option,August 2019,50,Metromover,arkhealthcare,The three routes offered were relatively small but the service was frequent and efficient. The metros are clean and there were security guards at some of the stations making it feel safe.
Poor maintenance!,August 2019,30,Metromover,baldeagle46,"This is a good light rail system but it needs to have a better maintenance schedule!  We got off the train at a station and needed to walk down 4 flights of stairs with our luggage since the elevators were not in service and there were not maintenance people anywhere to be seen!  Unfortunately there was a gentleman in a wheelchair who exited the train with us but he was not able to exit the station and go home!  He had to get back on another train, go to a different station, and then, hopefully with the elevators working there, arrange transportation to his home."
Nice and Safe ,July 2019,50,Metromover,G W,Loved the metro mover. I would recommend it to anyone new to the area.  It is easy to locate and travels to many areas downtown and to the museum area.
Excellent transportation in downtown Miami connecting points of interest and other transportation lines. And it is free,March 2019,40,Metromover,359serbanc,"When in downtown Miami or brickell, use the Metromover. It will get you all the way from the Arsht Arts Center to the Financial District in brickell"
Public transport in Miami,August 2019,50,Metromover,Road558022,The metromover is a fab service. Couldn’t believe it was free. Certainly helped us to fully enjoy our time in the city.
Nice place.,March 2019,50,Espanola Way,Jane G,"It’s a very nice place to take a stroll and pick a restaurant. So many restaurants are there with great food,that you really will enjoy. It’s always a lot of people there."
Not Pleasant,June 2019,20,Espanola Way,Maria R,We walked through here on a Tuesday night because we heard it was so neat... Did not care for the atmosphere. it felt like Time Square in New York City with people trying to get us to eat at their restaurant every 10 steps. It did not smell good either every.... Lots of unpleasant smells as we passed the restaurants including a rotten dumpster. 
Charming,June 2019,50,Espanola Way,diamondeyee,Charming street that reminds you of somewhere is Spain (Seville) I loved the nightlife and energy of this street! 
Stunning place,June 2019,50,Espanola Way,Michael F,"Check this place out, something different to do."
You must go,June 2019,50,Espanola Way,becca_green_27,"Espanhola Way is one of that places you must visit while in Miami Beach. Lots of incredible restaurants, really beautiful place and the atmosphere is awesome."
Retail for the Wealthy; Fun for the Masses,February 2019,50,Miami Design District,aliceann1,"Wonderful place to spend a few hours when ;you're not sunbathing on the beach or jet-skiing on the water. A new part of the city that has been developed which offers high-end shops (though there is a Sephora) and familiar  luxury brands. Several art galleries display innovative artists and it's great fun to peruse the streets and look at sculptures and murals which abound.  Several restaurants are  available for more formal dining and a multicultural marketplace is set set up to offer a huge variety of meals--eat in or take out. The architecture of the environment is fabulous and there is a great deal to see. Even children will have fun as there are many climbing structures, swings, etc."
Shopping Paradise,March 2019,50,Miami Design District,bellabella59,They are all here - any designer you like (except Chanel - they are only in Bal Harbour). Upscale outdoor shopping mall with art to admire also.
Holy cow...I was shocked,March 2019,30,Miami Design District,AmosC_13,"When I heard about the Miami Design District, I thought of building design.  I was shocked when it was cloths design.  It was all the high end stores you see in rich areas.we are a middle class couple walking around in a high class shopping area.  I felt way out of place."
Amusing and unique ,March 2019,50,Miami Design District,suzelkhoury,"This is new and unique! Even window shopping is great because none of the blazing shops is common, all uniquely done for this district and it shows. You can see genuine art pieces everywhere, tasteful, modern and luxurious so walking is fun even without any shopping! Although shopping experience is also special as employees are very funny , easy going, clever and helpful! "
Beautiful stores-- High End Retail!,February 2019,40,Miami Design District,Christine H,NIce place to WIndow shop... Everything is Retail list price and no sales to be found. and for tourist thye should nte there is not TAX saving here.
"Small, but lovely",February 2019,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,CoopyCobMN,A small oasis in the hub-bub of Miami Beach. We enjoyed our stroll though the garden. It took less than an hour. Make sure to walk by the Holocaust Fountain/Museum around the corner. The garden has a pool with large carp. Nice banana trees and orchids.
"Gorgeous, Tranquil Gem in Miami Beach!",February 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,AEP77,"This Botanical Gardens is worth the weird walk (alongside the Convention Center) from the main drag in Miami Beach.  Even if Lincoln Road and Collins Ave along the beach are your scene, this place is magical still and right out of a storybook.  The gentleman in the gift shop let us know they have a non-migrating kaleidoscope of butterflies in the gardens.  And there are butterflies floating all around you once you enter!  Enjoy but you don't need to allot more than 45 mins to this site."
What a treat!,February 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Cheryl J,This was my 3rd trip to Miami Beach but my first visit to the garden...loved it so much I went twice.  A lovely retreat from the hustle and bustle of Miami beach with gorgeous flora and fauna.  Pack a snack and a book and sit on one of the benches scattered throughout the garden for a bit of tranquility.
Little gem in the middle of stress world ,February 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Lar59,"I was looking to visit some new places in Miami on weekend and suddenly found this little oasis in the middle of concrete and noisy area .. not even drop of regret.. to spend almost two hours in peace and enjoying the amazing colours of flowers, thinking how important for us to feel that we are a small part of nature and we need to protect this fragile world , especially bees , who were working hard to protect our future on Mother planet. Thank you for great job to everyone who works in this amazing paradise . "
Very Zen,August 2018,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,regulartraveller01,Absolutely gorgeous oasis of flora and fauna. We found this place quite by accident on our first day and so glad we did. We love the beach but this was great to explore - so lush and tranquil - beautifully kept - very Zen and relaxing.
Little Havana,July 2019,40,Little Havana,TaherAlbaghliJulian,"Little Havana is Miami’s vibrant Cuban heart, with Latin American art galleries and busy restaurants. Cafes with walk-up windows sell Cuban coffee to cigar-smoking patrons. On Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street), locals discuss politics over dominoes at Maximo Gomez Park, dubbed Domino Park by locals. The historic Tower Theater screens independent and revival films, while the area's clubs host live Latin music.It was a little difficult to find this area .But,when you enter this area  walk the few streets of the neighborhood to get a sense of this area's culture. Must see"
A Taste of Havana,August 2019,40,Little Havana,jgcabecas,"Its not easy to find, but must only go by 8 street."
Fantastic place ,July 2019,50,Little Havana,lancsbabe,We went on a Sunday afternoon/night had fab tapas food and drinks. It’s pricey but you pay for what you get. The area had a great Latino vibe. And if you looking for salsa dancing etc this is the place to go. Lovely people. We seen some reviews saying can be a little dangerous  in places. We didn’t feel like that at all in fact quite the opposite. If you like a cigar your in the right place 
A Little Taste of Cuba,August 2019,50,Little Havana,Iponema,"This touristy area exposes one to a glance of a piece of history and some of the cultural customs of the Cuban people who settled in Miami.  You can see Cuban men actually playing the game Domino in the park-a traditional game popular among many Latin people.  There, in Little Havana, I visited a Cuban coffee and tobacco-cigar shop, and a Guayabera shirt shop.  There is even a shop where cigars are made by hand.  Although, the United States of America still does not permit the sale of Cuban cigars, you may purchase other made cigars from such countries as the Dominican Republic and other Latin American and Central Latin American countries, there in Little Havana, Miami, Florida.. This is a very educational, interesting, and cultural trip.  I highly recommend this trip/visit to Little Havana. "
So fun!,June 2019,50,Little Havana,LisaJSM,"Super cool just seeing the art, history, culture.  Lots of fun shops and plenty of eating places.  Love the music.  Don't miss Domino Park to watch the games.  "
Trade off between cost - free & time!,November 2018,40,Miami Trolley,FraserCambridge,"Also rode the North Beach loop and one of the SB loops, if you’re not in a hurry I’d say it’s definitely worth the time investment."
Easy to move inside the City. This service is free of charge,January 2019,50,Miami Trolley,Anadearmas, 
Free travel in some neighbourhoods,March 2019,40,Miami Trolley,simply-peregrinating,A cheap way to explore Miami on a reliable and regular service. In fact the Trolley system doesn't cost anything as it is free. The trolley bus has different lines so you have to change from line to line to really get around the city. Maps of the network are available on line and from tourist information offices. The trolley bus stops are marked with the palm tree logo with the name of the line below. The stops are very frequent. All the trolley buses have the line name on the front. The seats are wooden and can be uncomfortable if you sit on them for a long time. A downside is that the different routes are not integrated and run independently in different neighbourhoods.
Very Useful for Miami Beach,May 2019,50,Miami Trolley,LIMPIT,"Clean with free wi-fi, highly recommended."
Too Much of what was once a good thing,May 2017,30,Britto Central,jeffdol,When Britto debuted his work was whimsical and original but has become overly widespread and commercial.  IT is still fun to visit and a good place to buy a gift as there are many Britto decorated objects for sale.
Britto gallery & shop is a must!,May 2017,50,Britto Central,Alisa_MSA,We were very happily surprised that Britto's gallery & shop was so easily accessible. Great collection of his works. Don't have to buy but a must see!
We are HUGE Britto fans & collectors!  This place is awesome!,June 2017,50,Britto Central,760erins,"We came to the gallery about 10 years ago and bought 2 prints.  We since then have wanted more and on a recent trip to Miami decided to go back to collect some more fun pieces.  Britto art is so colorful and fun that makes us happy to look at it.  We also incorporate it in our home to add pops of color.  Well, we learned there is another shop down the road from the gallery (which is beautiful and bright!) that has more art that is a little more affordable. All of the people working at both spots are super friendly and extremely helpful.  I picked a print and quite a few other things, but once at the register saw something more spectacular and changed my mind.  The staff was totally cool with it (I spent more money) but had goosebumps with my choice.  The only downside is that we flew to Miami so we have to have our art shipped, so we have to wait for it :("
...if you love Britto...,July 2017,30,Britto Central,TheRealGelatoGirl,"...but I don't as his art reminds me of a Rizzi-wannabe. Nevertheless, the place offers a big amount of his pieces, many originals and a lot of paraphernalia. Not overly affordable, but as stated - if you like his art, definitely a place to go. "
Waste of time,July 2017,10,Britto Central,LynnM112017,These are ugly objects with vulgar colors.Stores like this are shame for the real art world.I am an art collector but will never enter or buy anything like this.
Simply beautiful ,August 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Nadine Z,What an amazing beautiful beach. Clean and not as much garbage floating around like some of the other beaches. The water was an clear green blue color and very way. The waves were just enough without being to powerful and knocking you over. It was such an amazing day spent there. 
Lovely Beach But not for Out of Towners,August 2016,40,Bal Harbour Beach,Gilkatzman,"While the beaches in Bal Harbour do not belong to the residents, the Village has done anything in their power to keep non residents away. "
Great beach. ,August 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,RichardPogg,We was staying at the St Regis. A great hotel. 
Perfect,July 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Camilla P,"I just love the Bal Harbour beach. It's very clean, not crowded, the sea seems calmer than other beaches close by. The walking path on the beach is great!"
grat beach,September 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Miki S,"very nice beach, quiet, few people very clean , nice to walk in the sand or the walkways   consider going early as at 4 pm even in summer the sun is not so hot"
Good Art Deco museum,January 2019,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,HoustonRobert,"Went to this museum a few years back and went again as they had a few new exhibits. The new exhibits were okay, but the Art Deco ones that are on permanent exhibit were well worth seeing again. A Interesting exhibit was the collection of about 50 Art Deco cocktail shakers in the lobby!  You can actually see this for free as you walk to the gift shop."
Hidden Gem,January 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,photocpin,"Glad we stumbled across this place.  A must see museum for historical design artifacts and history.  All the floors were interesting, even the ones that I thought would not be.  Well worth the time to visit."
Worth a visit if you're interested in  design history,January 2019,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,MMK3,"We found this museum by chance and were glad we did. It's small and some of the curation seems a bit random but it gives a good glimpse into the contribution made by the modernists, Bauhaus in particular, to 20th century art and design"
"Great museum to Art Deco, very interesting shop",January 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,JoeFLondon,"Look out for their free leaflet which describes elements of Art Deco movement, comparing exhibits in the collection with elements of buildings in the neighborhood. "
What a gem - world class Art Deco and design museum ,February 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,JeremyS588,"This is a must do if you’re interested in art, Art Deco or 20th Century Design. A treasure of a collection, especially the Genoese designs from the mid-20th century. "
"Once America’s most expensive zip code,",June 2015,50,Fisher Island,TourGuide-Manager,"Fisher Island is a private island which many famous people including Oprah Winfrey, Mel Brooks, Julia Roberts and Andre Agassi have called home.  Fisher was originally the southern tip of Miami Beach until 1905 when engineers cut through that southern tip of Miami Beach casting Fisher Island adrift.  Fisher Island is private and you can only visit if you are the guest of a resident. Fisher Island ferries leave every fifteen (15) minutes for the seven (7) minute ride to the island."
Beautiful,May 2016,50,Fisher Island,Reem H,We took a boat tour around here. It was  nice! I cannot believe the prices of the condos here. Pretty insane. Some very famous people live there. It is pretty cool to see in personl.
The very rich and super famous,May 2016,40,Fisher Island,Petru V,Fisher island is the hub of houses for the super rich and famous! Best way to see and also hear commentary is to take one of the bay cruises that is offered everywhere.
Beautiful Island,July 2016,40,Fisher Island,Jackie E,Just a beautiful island with expensive condos & a great view of the city of Miami. Only accessible by boat or air.
Special Experience,July 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,blastneurosis,"When I travel with my kids I always look for unique wildlife experiences. Usually they are essentially private rescues and zoo like facilities. But ZWF was much more unique. We did the Special Wildlife Experience which is essentially a provate tour and interaction with the animals. My kids and I loved it. There was a good range of animals, from reptiles, to an cute anteater, otter, sloth, owl, serval, wolf pup and squirrel monkey. But of course the highlight was a super cute and fun two month old tiger cub. The guide was helpful and was not uptight about time (i actually felt like we were dictating how long or short we wanted to interact with the animals which was great). If I have any criticisms it was 1) i didnt feel like our guide had that much knowledge about some of the animals. Maybe for the top tour available you should use the top experts in the staff especially given the price; 2) when we interacted with the wolf pup it was next to a large dumpster and when we intereacted with the tiget cub it was in a very sterile air conditioned room whcih the cub did not seem to like (was shivering a ton), and as you can imagine a big part of the experience is taking photos neither of which looked very good in those environments, and 3) the price which is probably a common complaint (Although, I did think it was ultimately worth it and probably limits the number of people the animals have to interact with which is good). Overall the highlight of our trip to Florida and I would recommend it."
Meeting the feline cubs,July 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Rachelhbic,Meeting and exploring the wild cats they had here was the best experience ever and my tour guide was great as well.
This was one of the best days of my life!!!!,August 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,justinegerace,"I wish I could come here everyday!! Me and my 3 cousins did the special wildlife tour and it was WELL worth the price. (We paid $450 since there was a sale but this tour was definitely worth the full $700) It was a 3 hour tour where we got to see EVERY animal at the zoo and interact with a lot of them. We got to touch animals that I didn’t even know they had there, like hedgehogs and baby alligators. At the end they saved a big amount of time for us to interact with their felines, and we got to spend about 30 minutes with them (baby jaguars, a tiger, and a caracallynx). Not to mention the zoo was completely empty which I loved. There were no large crowds, no loud noises, it seemed like it was just us and the tour guide walking around. It was an amazing experience and i think it’s more worth it than the 5 minute interactions for $100+. If you’re able to do the special wildlife tour, YOU SHOULD!! It was incredible. I have no complaints :)"
Great Day with My Daugter,May 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,George N,"This place is amazing - its literally a zoo, but privately owned. It has a hue collection of lions, tigers, panthers and other wildlife (monkeys, owls, etc). Some are availabe to be held and fed - throughout the entire tour we had a private guide for the 6 person group who was awesome and very knowledgeable. It was sold as an hour long tour but we easily took 2-3 hours to finish up, never feeling rushed at all. I thought it was a bit pricey at registration but afterwards, I felt it was worth every dime. Congratulations tot he owner who live on site and to all the staff - a great day with my youngest daughter Ali !!"
Black Jaguar Encounter,August 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Dnewpher,My husband and I had encounter with baby black jaguar. It was amazing to get to interact with such a beautiful creature. This was our 4th visit to ZWF. Love what they do and all the people are so nice. You can tell they love the animals.

Great event!,January 2018,50,Art Basel,Fatima E,"If you love art, this is the place and time to be in South Beach. There are also exhibitions in Downtown and other areas of Miami Beach"
Nice Community Park,September 2015,40,Westwind Lakes Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"I had heard of this park many times, but this was my first visit. There are lots of open green spaces / fields for recreational activities, including soccer, baseball and football.There is also a jogging trail. The wildlife I saw consisted of butterflies, brown anole lizards, dragonflies, muscovy ducks (which patiently waited in the picnic area hoping for a handout), and a few other birds. There is also a skateboard ramp park, and a community center (which has a pretty Everglades mural painting at the entrance) Parking and admission are free. Despite the name, the park is not on a lake, but does border a canal. Unfortunately for safety reasons it is fenced off, so fishing is not a possibility. The only other negative was that there were 3 park staff members (a shady looking woman and 2 others wearing park staff shirts) constantly joyriding around the park in a golf cart, acting unprofessional while guests had to get out of their path. The park must be way overstaffed if those three were apparently circling the park (with nothing else to do) for over an hour, trying to kill time and get paid additional hours and/or overtime. I can understand 1 staff member on a golf cart patrolling, but THREE? Overall I was still impressed with the park and will return."
A Little Bit of Everything,October 2016,50,Alice Wainwright Park,olga1024,"We had driven by this park so many times, but this is the first time we decided to visit.  What a beautiful park!  A waterfront beauty on Biscayne Bay, this park offers something to all kinds of visitors.  It has a basketball court, a workout area, a children's playground, picnic tables, and benches overlooking the bay.  You can make a day of it, pack a lunch and bring your fishing rod.  Or simply bring a blanket and a good book and you can lay on the grass and read to your hearts content.  Straight ahead you have a view of the Miami Seaquarium.  To the right you can catch a glimpse of Vizcaya.  This is a perfect spot to enjoy a beautiful Miami day."
Must See Park in Miami Beach,February 2016,50,Lummus Park Historic District,Kathy H,"It's hard to believe that developers of Miami Beach had foresight to preserve Lummus Park--so that it didn't end up as just another series of grand hotels on the ocean.  Fabulous, wide, flat beach is meticulously maintained by the City as well as the hotels. Great people watching: skate-boarders, super-models, families, lovers, many languages spoken. Rent bikes right there. The Art Deco District Museum is also there. If you want the largest, most colorful and expensive cocktail you've ever seen, there are plenty of bars across the street who will accommodate your desire. Got to visit this place or you have not really seen Miami Beach."
Incredible place!,September 2018,50,Stone Age Antiques,mwooduk,"This amazingly unique antique store is now under new management and huge strides have been made.  I know from visiting in the past that they do a lot of movie rental items here but you can also buy a plethora of unique old items - everything from dial up phones to stuffed animals to fabulous nautical (original stuff) items, lamps, lanterns, signs, old wooden tennis rackets - its one of those places you cannot describe, you just have to go there and see.  Highly recommended if you are looking for something unusual or unique."
One of a kind nautical and antique warehouse,October 2019,50,Stone Age Antiques,sdf66,I had some time to kill before my arrival at the airport and visited Stone Age antiques. It’s less than five minutes to return your rental car and if you have time to stop by you won’t be disappointed. I’ve been visiting for a number of years but now that the place is under new ownership it has been organized and cleaned up. To my amazement I find new items every time. 
A hidden jewel in this highly urbanized area,November 2014,40,Simpson Park,bgoldmeier,This is a very rare surviving hard wood mammock. The foliage is think and what Florida used to look like. The building is hardly anything but the nature walk is why you would go there.
Nothing Special,August 2015,30,Blue Lagoon,jaybeeFL,"Spent a night at the Hilton overlooking the lagoon. Water appeared clean, had numerous jet ski craft buzzing around and provided a picturesque frontal view when watching aircraft land and takeoff at MIA. The immediate area to the south and west of the lagoon is made up of hotels and office complexes. You need a car or taxi to go anywhere especially off prem dining. Convenient for those transiting via plane at MIA."

Bargain to South Beach,February 2017,50,Metrobus,800nickym,"We caught the metro bus from Miami international airport to 13th street south beach. It cost $4.25 for two of us!! A very helpful gentleman at the airport helped us purchase tickets from the machine, provided us with a map and showed us where the best place to get off for our hotel would be. A short wait of 10 minutes and then about 20- 25 minute journey. Saw the Miami skyline on the way. Great way to get to South Beach. "
ok,February 2016,50,Miami Convention Center,Janet1962_1,Not an important landmark for sure

Place for Trade shows,December 2015,50,Miami Convention Center,NDDN,The Miami convention Center has been hosting Trade shows for years. It is famous for the trade and business people from the ASD to the JIS show.Parking is available on 17th street parking garage or valet right outside the convention center. Can walk to many of the boutique hotels near by. Macy's store is at a walking distance. The convention center is clean and well maintained and has great security . 
Small Attraction but Free,January 2015,30,Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,MrMiamiExplorer,"The Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden is located on Watson Island, nearby Jungle Island, The Miami Children's Museum, and the Miami Yacht Club. Admission to this attraction is free, but there is no free parking. Your only parking options if taking your own transportation are to pay to park in the nearby parking garage, or feed the nearby meters across the street. The foliage is not very lush and most appeared to be unhealthy and not maintained. Also the fish pond was so poorly neglected that the water was green and thick as pea soup with algae. The fish were barely visible and probably starved for oxygen swimming in that slimy, algae soup. Based on the frenzy they made in the water when I approached, they were very hungry as well. The Garden is surrounded on all 4 sides by concrete walls, and it is a nice place to relax as it is so empty, but unfortunately the sound of cars whizzing by just feet away on the MacArthur Causeway kind of ruins the tranquility. I would not suggest making a separate drive just to visit this place, but if you have already traveled to or paid to visit one of the other businesses on the Island: such as Jungle Island or the Miami Children's Museum, than you may want to walk over to judge for yourself. A few times a year there are cultural events held at the garden.That is when I suggest going."
what a waste of a beautiful view!,June 2012,10,Miami City Hall,PaulSnood,"Only in Miami would the dirty politicians be treated daily to the best view in town.  Bayfront in Coconut Grove, it used to be the Pan Am Hub to Cuba. With all the empty space in center Coconut Grove that can't be filled, move the grafters there and develop a REAL waterfront complex that someone can use."

Passport ease,January 2014,50,Miami City Hall,Tiffany1116,"The ladies at the counter were very helpful.  If you have everything you need, it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes.  I went on a Monday at 10AM... no line!"
A City Hall With an Unusual History,March 2014,40,Miami City Hall,Lowdslanding,"Surrounded by the many beautifull boats tied up at the marina, the restored City Hall building was originally the Pan American Airlnes terminal for its "" Flying Clippers "" aircraft that landed in the bay after returning from their flights to South America & other destinations to the south. In the lobby of the City Hall building , you will find the large and beautifull "" Pan Am World Globe "" that was placed there when Pan Am first opened the facility back in the day. A leasurly walk by the docks and perhaps lunch or dinner at one of the well known nearby resturants will make for a very plesant visit. No charge to go inside the City Hall to see the Globe & parking is free. All welcome."
Nothing to see,January 2015,10,Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,SeleneBenita,"Very disappointing. The worst Japanese garden I've ever visited. If it wasn't for the jade Buddha exhibit, it would have been a complete waste. Plus it was $10 to park and $10 to get in and we spent about 20 minutes there."

Beautiful park awful staff,June 2018,10,Miami Marlins,EvelynM2371,We wanted to take pictures after the game... the staff was extremely forceful and rude... kicking us out and telling us we couldn't take quick a picture even as we pointed out people closer to the front row taking pictures she said they paid for their tickets ....[we did too] told her how rude she was... at this point another staff member joined in and continued harassing us.  At some point as the conversation heated the first staff member stated that I was lucky she was in her uniform and threatened me... over a couple selfies after the game. [Red shirt staff]
Excellent ball park,July 2018,50,Miami Marlins,brianmZ9243TR,"I’ve been to many ball parks and this is one of my favorites. Indoors, cool, bright, live music and decent food. It’s a great way to watch a game. "
Terrible Venue for a show. Don’t waste your money! Or your time!,December 2017,10,James L. Knigth Center,tbb23,"Most disappointing, the staging was awful. The speaker banks blocked the viewing area of close to 2/3 of the crowd. We could see a sliver of the giant screen— but never enough to actually see what was on it. The two side projections were broken— Fluffy even said something about it when he started the show. For a comedian who is supposed to be at the top of the game (which he wasn’t) and a venue that is supposed to be first class— THEY MISSED. Don’t go to an event here unless you are Center and in the first few rows. Otherwise It’s a WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY"
Miami Convention Center,March 2012,50,Miami Convention Center,Olivetree841,"Visited Car shows, Boat shows and much more. This center is a place that is very busy with different kinds of activities through out the year."

A great facility for conventions.,May 2012,40,Miami Convention Center,ralpael,"While this may be too small for the large conventions, groups and associations that can  fit in this hall will not be disappointed.

Update the Spelling & get More Reviews (just saying)!,January 2018,50,James L. Knigth Center,imru12,"Great venue for the Bitcoin Conference; very nice bathrooms, huge auditorium which was well ventilated for speakers; a little tricky with so many people being dropped off but it worked out."
Dangerously outdated Venue,February 2018,10,James L. Knigth Center,JWF9,"Was there for the Van Morrison show.  The venue is dated which did not affect the show, it was fantastic!!.  The problem is this place has seen better years.  The old stairs leading to the second level are too narrow.  Seating on the second level also suffers from dangerously narrow stairs with absolutely no hand rails.  Considering most of the attendees were over 50, it was hazardous.  There is no lighting leading up any of the stairs either, people were tripping and stumbling and not from alcohol consumption.  There is only one way in and out, if there was a fire many would not be able to escape.  "
This place is the worst!!,February 2018,10,James L. Knigth Center,Edgefieldian,"The employees of this establishment are the rudest, most incompetent people I've ever dealt with. It's like they are brainwashed to this script - ""Where did you buy your tickets? Third Party? Then it's their fault."" Third party sales are a common business practice nowadays and not what they used to be. Will never return, nor recommend that anyone attend any event here. Stay away!!"
Dated venue,February 2018,30,James L. Knigth Center,Echaman9,"Their website mentioned discount parking at the Miami Tower garage during events. It took us about 30 minutes from the 95 exit to get into the garage (due to congestion we got routed 1 block away and had to continue a few blocks further as result of roads closed for construction). The garage has direct access to JLKC which we found convenient. The venue itself is quite dated - limited number of restrooms which are spaced too far apart, hallways are not well laid out and funnel to 1 central corridor so before and after show it was very slow to move about, soiled carpets and smudged windows needed cleaned throughout, and inside the concert hall it was way too warm. "

Great Park,July 2018,50,Miami Marlins,docbuzz1,"Great park, look forward to next visit. Ticket prices were very affordable, we got 4 tickets in the third base club area for a very reasonable price. The facility is very nice and clean, well maintained. The staff, working there were great. We had a great time watching the game there."
Beautiful on the outside but disappointing inside,December 2018,30,James L. Knigth Center,juliegI6249SD,"This auditorium needs a remodel.  The seats are old and worn.  It feels like you are sinking down in them and there are tears on the backs of the chairs.  The seats are made for short, skinny people.  I was squished in my seat and could not even share the armrest as the person sitting next to me was a big girl.  I am only 5'3'' and my knees almost touched the chair in front of me.  The girl next to me looked very uncomfortable as her knees were touching the seat in front of her with her legs bent back.  The good part of this place is the outside.  They did have food and drinks so that was a plus even though they did not give you much food.  "
Disappointed by Double Standards,April 2017,20,Miami Marlins,Garethsc,"If you pay to sit down by home plate you can move around and sit in any of the vacant seats and the staff jump to do your bidding. If you pay to sit in the less expensive but still substantial cost behind the bases you get harassed by the seat gestapo that the Marlins employ. I went to the Pittsburgh game on Saturday 29 Apr, 4-0 loss. While I was getting my handicapped wife a $6.50 cotton candy that was just tiny, she was being asked to move because she had my ticket and I had hers, just to be clear the next seat. I watch people move around the box seats on TV at this stadium every night. No one says a thing. My recommendation, save your money and watch on TV, no one will charge you 6,50 for 2ozs of sugar, you can switch channels when they perform this bad and maybe someday they'll get the message..........."

Yikes! Parking and Traffic are and issue!,May 2016,30,James L. Knigth Center,Scott P,"I was here over the weekend for my college graduation. The area is not planned out at all for heavy traffic. It took 30 minutes to get off the highway at the SE 2nd Street exit. There is parking in the Hyatt garage which is attached to the James L. Knight Center, but I recommend parking in the Wells Fargo building across the street in the 333 building. While everyone was fighting to get out of the Hyatt parking garage, we just walked across the street, got into our car and left without issue. The center itself is fairly large but dated and in need of a facelift. Depending on who was performing there and the price I would recommend going, but there are many nicer venues in the area."
Great stadium bad ownership,June 2017,30,Miami Marlins,Julio2509,"Its a real shame, the stadium is really nice, (also a lie to the public). The only reason to show up is to watch the opponent, but do verify the offers and fine print.   "
Tour the Beautiful Miami Marlins Park,November 2016,50,Miami Marlins,Irene F,"My husband and I were really impressed by the tour of the park.  We went on the tour in November, and were the only two to show up for the 11:00 AM tour.  We got the royal private tour!  We got to see the press room which is the best I have ever seen, the bobble head collection which is in a huge vending machine...you find your team mascot and punch in the number to see your mascot or your favorite player.  They have the largest multi team bobble head collection. The park has pop up restaurants (more than one)  at every game, which is unheard of.  We got to see the aquarium, go in the players workout room, sit in the owner's box and just absorb the beauty of the architecture.  Looks like a great place to see a game."
Baseball Opening Games,April 2017,40,Miami Marlins,Elimsyhtac,"I must honestly say that I'm not a sports fan, but my other half is. So I was visiting and he wanted to attend the games so bad, I decided to go with him. I must say from the moment you got to the outside of the venue the excitement was in the air, I couldn't help being drawn into the atmosphere of jubilation. We purchased our tickets at the ticket booth and upon entering you were searched to ensure you weren't taking in anything that you weren't suppose to, by this time I'm looking at this as an adventure. While progressing to find our seats we were given cups as souvenirs and calendars so we could follow the various dates set for events. The entire time of the match for me was fun nonstop. I was enjoying myself taking pictures of the mascots, the various baseball players and the patrons doing the wave. I recommend that as long as its baseball season visit the stadium even once."
Great evening full of fun and entertainment ,August 2017,50,Miami Marlins,J9541FVmichaelh,The tickets were great value and the kids got given loads of giveaways. This was a brilliant experience we all loved it. 
Great space,January 2019,50,James L. Knigth Center,Iwuvtotravel,One of our favorite bands Camila n Sin Bandera were performing here I have to say I was impressed.. comfy seats as we did sit for over 2 hours. Drinks were not too pricy considering the venue and our seats were I. Section 103 row f which was perfect I definitely would book again here
Hot hot hot,October 2018,10,James L. Knigth Center,1candywife,So if you go there get ready to sweat...where something cool n comfy...
Unorganized venue,November 2019,30,James L. Knigth Center,Umana_manu,"Starting from the parking experience came with an hour of anticipation and was unable to get into the parking until the ""event time"" which was 8:30pm then I paid $200 for my front tickets and got a sit in ""front"" but it was a bunch of chairs super closed together with no labels. Saw multiple times that people had to move around because they sat I. The wrong place, the lines for food and drinks where ridiculous, thank god the event was great I saw Daniel Habif he was great and this is the only reason why this place got 3 starts. But the event didn't even start on time. I would think twice before coming to this place again"
MISSES CONNECTIONS,May 2017,10,Metrobus,traveltrackers,"As the metro rail pulls into a stop the bus pulls away and sometimes you have to wait 45 minutes to an hour or more on the weekends. Express buses from the outlying area are more functional. Look for the little area trolleys that are complimentary. Listed online. S bus from downtown through South Beach, Miami Beach, to Aventura is terrific."
Very inexpensive way to get to South Beach,February 2018,40,Metrobus,boopdboop,"We used Metrobus to South Beach from airport and saved big time. A cab would be at least 50 dollars or more, this bus is only 2.25 one way and took only 20 min. to get to South Beach."
Look it is the worst public bus system we've ever used and we've been all over the world,April 2019,10,Metrobus,dharty86,"This is a third world country public bus system. No timetable, late by over an hour so it is entirely plausible that it only runs a third of it's buses, buses are outdated and still use string to notify driver for stops, and plastic bucket seats. We wasted almost 3 hrs trying to get from Miami South beach to the mall at 163rd Street. My impression is I'm better to walk or cycle than rely on this bus system. Horrible. Can't comment on the airport connection."
Watch a marlins game,July 2016,50,Miami Marlins,NiloVentura,"We always have a great time watching a game at Marlin stadium .    It is a new stadium with a great view from every seat.    It has a wide variety of different foods .    Go to the ""taste of Miami"" section to try some Latin food.  Also , the clevander bar is free to enter after the 7th inning.    It is located by left field.   You will enjoy the experience."

First-time baseball game,June 2019,40,Miami Marlins,zahl87,"Me and my wife were visiting Miami and the USA for the first time. It was fun to watch our first baseball game. Did not know any of the baseball rules before the game, but watched some Youtube videos about rules before the match - surprised over how complex the game is! Lasted for approximately 2 1/2 - 3 hours, but a lot of entertainment during the game. And time went by. Impressed over the large indoor stadium at Miami Marlins. Drinks and food expensive - but its USA. Public transportation almost all away to front doors (bus - walking 5 minutes)."
the Marlins could teach the Yankees a few things about customer service,June 2019,50,Miami Marlins,VictorS1959,"bucket list to see all ML teams - only 6 left. Amazing experience at the Marlins. Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. The food was great, with outstanding variety and reasonable (for ML baseball) prices. Given how rude and unhelpful the Yankees staff was, it's too bad they draw and the Marlins don't."
Awesome Experience,July 2019,50,Miami Marlins,E162L82,"Overall great experience and we’ll definitely be going back. I’m sure most people will enjoy watching a game, especially in Air Conditioning ....."
Marlin's Game,August 2019,10,Miami Marlins,krystellet2016,This stadium has nasty roaches in the top levels. The game was good because they were winning but after seeing the roach we left the game. They need to clean this stadium better!
Marlins game,September 2019,10,Miami Marlins,Fins1999,I found the portion in this tiny helmet to be insulting and embarrassing for almost $7.  My kid looked at me as if this was a joke.  This by no means is fan or family friendly.   I suggest getting dessert after the game

Really nice people,February 2019,40,Little Haiti Cultural Complex,CSSnowshoer,"We really enjoyed walking around the campus, meeting vendors, watching children play.

Beautiful area,June 2016,40,Blue Lagoon,Motherofchildren,There are great hotels here and some good shopping. Mostly this is a place for business meetings because it is so convenient to the airport 
The Hilton Blue Lagoon,February 2017,40,Blue Lagoon,abullington11,"Excellent Hotel, great service, great views and good food!  This hotel was chosen for an overnight stay before leaving on a cruise.  Reasonable price for the area and great views from the pool and the room.  The service here was excellent and so was the food!  We will definitely return for our next stay.  Yes you need transportation for any activity outside the hotel and that can be expensive. Convenient for airport transition or going directly to the cruise port."
Ok,August 2018,30,Blue Lagoon,MiltonKanno,"Two water splash fountains, that is it. No blue water, no swimming conditions, no bordwalk, no deck, no nothing. I dont even know why people put it to reviews hehehe. I stayed at Pullman airport and from my window I could ser it. But that is it."

"Cool, shady park in the heart of downtown!",October 2016,40,Simpson Park,TampaTrips,"This park is very pretty with completely shaded, cool trails throughout. Enter off of 17th just a few blocks from brickle and all of the skyscrapers. A real jewel for the neighborhood that surrounds it."
Secluded,March 2017,50,Simpson Park,brittanyb601,Great little secluded nature walk. Low impact. The nature trail is made of tiny seashells. Cute pond in the middle. 
Nice but ...,May 2017,30,Simpson Park,Manatee4Me,"This is a nice little park preserving some of the original forest that once dominated the Miami area. There is a visitors' center off South Miami Avenue, with a small store. The park would be great if not for the number of apparently homeless people around. Frankly, I did not feel safe walking there alone,  even though no one threatened me in any way. I would recommend that you visit this park with at least one other person."
Update - Guided Walks on Weekends,September 2018,30,Simpson Park,Manatee4Me,"I was pleased to learn that the Simpson Park now offers naturalist-guided walks on the weekends. I think this is a great way to see the park. It was hurt by last year's Hurricane Irma, but is still worth seeing (especially for the price - it's free!)."
"Interesting historical site, good place to visit.",May 2016,40,Miami City Hall,Motherofchildren,Dinner Key is a pretty place to visit and this building which was the former Pan American terminal is very nostalgic and symbolic of the Old Miami. 
"Good for Pictures, Parking available easily",November 2016,40,Miami City Hall,akshayc35,"It's a good place for taking the pictures, having a short walk through the park and parking is easily available, so bonus points there."
"Small, but interesting",September 2018,50,Miami City Hall,619jeffry,"Miami City is now part of the Miami Dade County. Miami City Hall is nice, in an Art Deco style. If you want to go inside, you will have your bag searched. It's walking distance to Coconut Grove. The Dinner Key Marina, which is said to be government-run, is just next door. The Marina is still recovering from a hurricane which sank many boats."
ELECTRIC CAR CHARGING STATIONS ARE NO FUNCTIONING,June 2019,30,Miami City Hall,j h,I left frustrated
"Misleading label of ""City Hall"". Interesting art deco style building",November 2019,30,Miami City Hall,allanriley9,"Spent about 2 hours by trolleybus visiting this place, really a waste of valuable time! Not a classic old historical pile as we thought just an interesting relatively modern structure, only interesting details were that this was the loxation pf the old PAN AM flying boat base."
Could be nicer....,December 2017,20,Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,SheemaE,"I was looking for another Japanese Garden but it seems like that one was in the Jangle Island, which was closed on the day I visited.   I walked around the area and found this garden.  Entrance was nice, but inside was rather neglected.  The main area with water looked like a big concrete pool, but behind it,  the rock garden area is nicer.  It is not worth visiting this garden only unless you happened to be in the area."
Japanese Pocket Park,February 2018,30,Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,Bubbyli2014,Come visit the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens japanese Garden you wont be disappointed
A 20 minute visit for this tiny place,March 2018,20,Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,hectorfrommiami,"I was expecting something in a smaller scale as the Morikami gardens in West palm Beach, but this is like the size of my backyard, which is small, and even when it is clean and well tended, is is lacking life.  I was expecting a bigger garden offering more to relate to the Japanese culture but I was sincerely disappointed. It is difficult to find, I was asked to park on the gravel, and in less than 20 minutes I was out of there.  I have not even started checking my photos of the place, as it did not appeal to me. I did not see any iguanas nor any other animal there. I called for info before the visit and left my name and number and never got a call back. I am not planning to return"
Not a destination,February 2019,20,Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,Elaine1953,"Took a Lyft to the garden, which sounded promising. It's small and free and in February, and compared to gardens in Japan, it was a disappointment. We stayed about 20 minutes and found luckily got another Lyft quickly. It is next door to the Parrot Jungle, so perhaps if you are going there, it's worth taking in the Japanese Garden at the same time."
Please improve it,May 2019,30,Ichimura Miami Japanese Garden,FabianPulido,"Well... Japanese garden is nice, can be improved, you can seat and meditated, be in silence, maybe you don’t want this for vacation, but is good for people who appreciate silence. a lot of koi fish in the pond. Not a vacations point! "

Surprise!!,October 2016,40,Alice Wainwright Park,Titi0809,"We went to celebrate the 1st birthday of our daughter. We tried to make a reservation but unfortunately we couldn't, so we went early in the morning and pick a pavilion, we decorated with balloons and party stuff, we put a table cover and even plastics cups, all with the intention to ""reserve"" the place ! Well when we came back not only another people was in the pavilion, other pavilion was decorate with our stuff, So, if you are planing to celebrate something, pick a park when you can make a reservation! Beside of this! It's a really nice place with a wonderful bay view, and the people who works there are very kind. "
Beautiful Views,July 2017,50,Alice Wainwright Park,Andrea P,"This is one of my favorite parks in Miami. The water views and tree line street of Brickell Ave make it an amazing place to walk, ride bikes, jog, or rollerblade. The street is a dead end so it's great for those activities and there's always a police officer hanging around for extra safety. The park has everything from basketball courts, workout equipment, pavilions for parties and events and bathrooms.  There's  a jungle gym for kids to play and lots of shaded seating options. A lot of people come here to take maternity pictures or gender reveal photos. The only hassle can be parking if you're having a party here, but other then that, it really is a Miami treasure to me.  "
Hidden Gem!,August 2017,50,Alice Wainwright Park,Tanya0912,"Hidden gem!! The waterfront view is just gorgeous with the palm trees for lots of shades. There are benches, some picnic tables with pavilions, and barbeque grills. Great place for both kids and adults!"
Away from noise and crowd,April 2019,30,Alice Wainwright Park,rubemkrapf,"was there during the week... beautiful place, space for kids, close to the water, trees, shade... perfect for a few hours of relax. The avenue in front has no thru traffic, just people that live there. So you may bring your bike, run, walk...  You do not have a great view of Downtown Miami but probably this is not what you are looking for.... no food and drinks close by..."
"Nice for walking, exercising, activities",August 2016,40,Westwind Lakes Park,mwooduk,"I just found this park when checking out the free Baptist Hospital Zumba classes that are held here twice a week. Unfortunately the class room is small and there are always too many people for the class so it's hard to get in!   If I arrive early before class, I walk around the perimeter, there is plenty of parking, places to sit, shady trees and soccer and exercise classes going on.  Nice!"
Nice and relaxing!,September 2016,50,Westwind Lakes Park,Nani1108,The park is very nice. In a good neighborhood and it also has exercising machines and walking and running trails. It also has gazebos for rent and volleyball courts.
splash park!!,July 2017,40,Westwind Lakes Park,lalocadr19,"I went to a friend birthday party. The splash area it great for kids, lot of water fun.

OK,January 2017,30,Miami Convention Center,BigoBoca,"This is a large spot for conventions and there are many held here. I , personally prefer to park my own vehicle and this place makes that impossible"
"Dated, moldy, maze of a place",January 2018,30,Miami Convention Center,Motherofchildren,"This used to be a very nice venue but now, we found it difficult to breathe in there from the mold. In general it is very dated and not very clean. "
Miami Convention Center,March 2018,40,Miami Convention Center,387indy,"Miami Convention Center is downtown on SE 2nd Ave. Its well maintained, beautiful, and where they hold many conventions. It is where they have boat shows, car shows, home shows."
Hardly extraordinary ,May 2019,30,Miami Convention Center,StephenCr0ss,Large building that has served its purpose and perhaps needing an upgrade. Nice to see but not recommended as a “must see”.
Dimension center at the Hyatt,October 2019,40,Miami Convention Center,Hendersoned,Lots of rooms in a pretty nicely furnished the giant auditorium is showing it’s age but overall nice facilities some of the restrooms on the third floor look like they haven’t been remodeled since the 70s but everything downstairs is quite nice
Beautiful,April 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,chez442002,Every garden brings its own uniqueness when you visit them. This one was no different. We first did the little tram tours around the gardens to get an overview of what we were to experience. It was very informative and gave you the history of how the gardens came about. We were very fortunate to see so many beautiful orchids and other flowers as we walked the grounds. The butterfly garden was also a great experience. If you have the time and love flowers I would make this a for sure stop.
Beautiful gardens and butterfly house,April 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,JMar604,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to these gardens.  Although the tram wasn't operating that day, we were able to walk the whole grounds.  You're given a map and a ""what's blooming"" guide when you pay the entrance fee.  It was fun looking for and identifying what we were seeing.  The Butterfly house was well done.  Lots of butterflies and there were even hummingbirds.  Quite hot inside there but worth the heat!"
Fabulous gardens,May 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Middlemiss,"There are 82 acres, but do not worry they have a bus/trolley going round giving a guided tour. Best to do this first, then you can chose where to go back too walking. There are water stations and two cafes to keep you going. Its trees many with flowers that delight the eye. You need nearly a day to do it justice. Good place for children to run round. Most of the hosts are volunteers with such enthusiasm."
Magical,May 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Recursivecomet,I truly love coming to this place. My mother started bringing me here since I was a child and I remember thinking I was in a Magical Fairytale Land. And I still feel this way every time I come back. A must see when your in the Miami Area. They have several Special Events During the Year that are quite beautiful as well. So don’t miss out on this Amazing Place.
Perfect Cozy Small Church,June 2016,50,St. Raymond Catholic Church,OPSilver,Very pretty church and I personally love it.
Stroll Biscayne Bay,January 2019,50,Museum Park,805donaldk,"This January the cruise ship I took from Baltimore visited Miami.  On prior occasions South Beach was our favorite excursion.  With the weather in mind we decided to take a walk from the ship to explore a segment of downtown Miami.  Biscayne boulevard and the Freedom Tower are a short one mile walk from the cruise port across a auto/pedestrian bridge.  Our goal ultimately was Museum Park, an additional half mile down Biscayne Blvd.  What a great decision on our part.  The park offers several different paths to enjoy for shade in the summer and pleasant breezes in the winter.  The outer path goes along the bay giving views of the cruise port, MacArthur Causeway and the birds of the bay.  We ended our walk at the art museum.  Although we did not tour the museum we enjoyed the swing chairs on the museum patio and the hanging gardens around the museum.  On the way back to the bridge we to took a side trip to go to the Freedom tower circulator stop.  We rode the free circulator loop route around downtown planning places to go on future visits to Miami.  By the time we returned to the ship our exercise trackers indicated that we walked an easy four miles over 3 hours.  South beach is a good beach/bar destination but there is much more to enjoy outside of the beach."
"In spanish or english, BBB teatrical amusement available..",September 2018,50,Paseo Wynwood,Gustavo G,"I bought a US$ 20 ticket for a monologue called FARHAD. Simply amazing.

Very nice!,December 2018,50,Morningside Park,Shela01,"Hard for me not to find a place in Miami I don't enjoy. This park is kind of hidden, but very nice as it's on the water. It offers kayak and paddle boarding rentals so a good all around place that offers a few options for those of us outdoor types. Recommend!!"
Very nice park,January 2019,40,Morningside Park,HalClarke,"The park is free and offers many attractions. There are large grass areas and plenty of mature trees. There are ball fields, tennis courts, a boat ramp, fishing areas, playgrounds for both tots and slightly older kids, kayak/paddleboard rentals, picnic areas, benches, restroom facilities, and lots of space to walk, run, or relax. The water views are great across the bay to Miami Beach. At one time, there was a public pool. It's still there, but closed at this time. There's plenty of free parking. Dogs are welcome, provided you clean up after them. The Miami police visit frequently, adding to the secure feel. Hours are sunrise to sunset."
New Tennis Courts,December 2018,40,Morningside Park,backhand_city,The Tennis Center at Morningside Park just got a big make over. They even added one new extra tennis court for a total of eight.  It's first come first serve and a great place to play tennis in a tropical environment that only Miami can deliver steps away from Biscayne Bay.
Considering it’s a photography based location the lighting is terrible. ,August 2019,20,Unicorn Factory,Essextravellots,Entry price is steep too a family of four was $160 plus.... 
such a cool place,October 2019,30,Unicorn Factory,aventuresmelanie,"The idea is good, the decors are awesome, but the lighting is awful, so you need to play with your setting a lot after. But it's a really cool place. They offer the services of a professionnal photograph but it is expensive"

Funnn for all ages,December 2019,50,Unicorn Factory,Roving607989,I don’t usually write reviews but I felt as though this place really deserved one. It was such a good time!! Came here with a few friends while visiting Miami and we had a blast. The staff is so friendly and attentive and the decor was something everyone should check out especially if you’ve got social media and like to post cool photos! If you’re visiting the wynwood area in Miami be sure to check this place out! Looks like it would be fun for kids too!
Hidden Gem in the Bird Road Art District,July 2016,50,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,VictoriaC485,"There is such a good vibe at Lincoln's Beard Brewing Company from the moment you step into the place.  This  ""small"" brewpub located in the Bird Road Arts District in Miami, FL reminds me of a modern twist on old English pubs. It truly allows you the time to have great conversation while enjoying even greater craft beer. The brewery is in the process of ramping up production to have their flagship beers on tap full time.  I was told it would be in the next few weeks.  If you are lucky enough to be there when they tap pilot batches of their flagship beers or experimental beers (P. Swayze, Lucky Machete, Witch King, Monty Dreams of Barley, Mango Skyline), you are in for a craft beer treat.   The service is great and the staff is very attentive and knowledgeable.  They have recently added a permanent food truck to their beer garden area which has been a tremendous hit and pairs up nicely with their delicious craft beer.  They have weekly events to keep you entertained (trivia, karaoke).  If you are looking for a place to unwind, have fun, and drink great beer... Lincoln's Beard Brewing Company is the place to go!"

Applause for HistoryMiami in claiming this important archeological site,June 2013,50,The Miami Circle,Floridabluemacau,"If you go, look for a slip road that parallels Brickell and descends to the river. It is usually flanked by taxis. Turn left immediately off of Brickell in front of the Viceroy and drive down to the park."
A strange little historical spot,April 2015,30,The Miami Circle,Michael P,"Little to really see, nice vista beside the Miami River but you have to negotiate with the Viceroy hotel to park and apart from the historical connection with ancient Miami, it is not a well presented location"
Beautiful Place!,May 2013,50,Neighborhood Fish Farm,Bobby B,"This place is amazing! It's very underground and it's a shame not many people know about this place. There is tons of fish to choose from.

Great place for fish lovers,February 2014,50,Neighborhood Fish Farm,BetzJitomir,"I went there on 2/10/14. They are open to the public from noon to 6:00 pm. They have all kinds of fish that they breed and grow at very reasonable prices. Even if you are not buying it is worth going to look if you are a fish hobbiest. And despite what they say on the website, if you go in person and talk to Bob he will ship the younger koi and other small fish for you that are not listed on their web site. We were not leaving Miami for a week and he arranged to call me when I got back and send my fish after I gave him  my credit card number over the phone. Very friendly and helpful. Best of all it is free to go in and look."

Thanks for letting us hang out!!
You've never seen so many fish in one place,February 2014,40,Neighborhood Fish Farm,Jadeqt,It's a great place to find fish for the family aquarium. The staff is very helpful. Lauren was great and so gentle with our fish. Great place to take kids too.
Lovely place- fabulous owners,August 2014,50,Neighborhood Fish Farm,Lisa T,"This fish farm is a little gem tucked away in Miami. The owners are so friendly and truly love their farm and it's fish. They have years of experience and wisdom. This farm is a fun place to bring kids to see all sorts of fresh water fish and a great educational experience as well. Once on the farm, you will quickly forget that you are even in Miami!"
the aborigine,April 2016,50,The Miami Circle,TourGuide-Manager,The Miami Circle is a 2000 year old archaeological site that was discovered in 1998 during a routine archaeological survey.

Bare-boned,January 2016,30,Museum of Contemporary Art,southmiamibeachbum,"I have heard that the museum is seeking a new site so perhaps that is why they only had one exhibit which was interesting, but it was a short trip so keep that in mind. "
Nice fresh stuff with come good prepared foods too!,November 2014,40,Coconut Grove Organic Market,KellyNew63,"Big selection. Even though it is expensive, the stuff lasts longer and is organic. Compare that to an item from the grocery store that goes sale just before it is about to collapse. I swear the spinach lasts twice as long as store bought.  You also get the old Grove vibe there with lots of funky people selling healthy produce, etc. There are also some unusual items you do not see around Miami."
Excellent ,November 2014,50,Coconut Grove Organic Market,claudiaalaix,"You can have delicious healthy food, buy clothes and get a massage at the same place! must try the chia ballz!!!"
Great Selection,July 2015,40,Coconut Grove Organic Market,KeithD16,"A little hard to find if you don't know your way around, but was very pleased we went.  It has some booths that sell other things, but the real gem is the vegetable and fruits they offer.  All kinds of selection, some I have rarely seen, and lots of specialty items.  Also have some pre-made items that were very high quality."
Bizaar,August 2013,20,Museum of Contemporary Art,jpseader,"Bookstore sell candy, tees and books."
Terrific Collection with Excellent Shows.,October 2013,50,Museum of Contemporary Art,mbeacher3455,"This museum has a terrific contemporary art collection. The curators here put on excellent shows. Although it's in North Miami (I wish it were either in Miami Beach or Downtown), it's worth the trip."
"Worth an Hour, Small but Focused",December 2013,40,Museum of Contemporary Art,MarkWBoca,"Tucked away in North Miami is a tiny, but worthwhile little museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art.  Rather than trying to cover contemporary art, the museum rotates its exhibits.  On the day we visited, the British contemporary artist Tracey Emin was the entire exhibit.  Although her work would not be everyone's taste, it has received a measure of acclaim throughout the world.  MOCA displays part of her work, a whole lot of neon signs plus an 18 year old film she did of her dancing after recalling her teenage sexual adventures and misadventures.  Yes, not everyone's taste in art.  But, that is art.  It was a worthwhile hour and worth the modest admission charge.  Free parking in adjacent public parking lots."
Very interesting museum,April 2014,50,Museum of Contemporary Art,DonnaFC,"This museum is a little out of the way simply because it was not in the same area as the rest of the museums in Miami, but it was worth the drive. The exhibit we saw was by Wangechi Mutu, a Kenyan-born artist who works with paint and collage mainly. It was a fascinating exhibit, the kind that stays with you and has you think about it long after you've left the museum. "
If you have an hour to kill in North Miami….,June 2014,30,Museum of Contemporary Art,BabsNMarty,"I've seen other interesting exhibits in the past, and I'll go back, hoping to catch something new and exciting."
Great place to spend a few hours!,August 2016,40,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,TravelChica2129,Will be back and will bring friends!
There's a brewery here?,September 2016,30,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,559jas,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The staff was cool and the crowd seemed quite laid back. I was a little disappointed in the selection of beers on draft. I visited their website before I went and hoped that I would have the opportunity to try all the beers. Unfortunately, not all beers were on tap. I had the Witch King Stout. Cool name but the beer wasn't very special. My wife had the Irish Red and it tasted average. I also had the Swayze IPA. This was the best beer I had there. They do have some nice options on the pours. My wife enjoyed the smaller pours while I enjoyed the larger ones. And the price wasn't bad either. I'd like to return and try the Lucky Machete Brown, the Barrel aged brown and the double IPA. Hopefully when I find myself back in the neighborhood, I will have the opportunity. "
great time!!!,December 2016,50,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,lalocadr19,"Great time celebrating friend birthday in the private area upstairs. Friendly staff, cheap local made in house. Delicious food truck. Great music and ambiance."
Went for a pet event to try this place,February 2017,40,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,sbrameister,"Saw they were hosting a pet event and decided to have a mini date night with my husband and take along our 13 year old Siberia Husky/Malamute Mix (Alusky), Nanook. Arrived around 7:30 pm, place was jammed packed, we were lucky to find parking because my husband is a disabled veteran so we have a handicap tag. Otherwise I think we would not even try to park. We actually hung out on the back patio, the inside felt a little overcrowded, I guess we are not into big crowds anymore... however, people were enjoying themselves and hanging out with their furry four legged creatures. Try their beer, was excellent. Encounter a couple of friends. Didn't eat anything, we had dinner earlier and were not hungry, however, they mentioned that the food truck parked in the back patio had some delicious Tacos. We will plan to come another day, it's nice to find a local brewery with good crafted beer. Since we didn't know how this place was at first, we didn't go with our 14 year old son, he actually was attending student services and activities at church, so it was a win win. It's a casual place, we saw actually people with very small children (3,6 years old), I would not think to take small children but to each its own, not judging but it would not be my option. The host different events during the month, we are learning more about it. But definitely will come back, when it's not too busy. They have live music on Thursday and Friday. I like to support small businesses."
Such a beautiful place,December 2019,50,Unicorn Factory,O2373WH_,"Had an amazing time! Everything was perfect! Very cool place. Nice, professional workers. Each room is different. Good place for kids. Definitely will come again."
Delightful walk,December 2017,40,Miami Riverwalk Trail,farogisi,"Delightful walk through the palaces of the Miami residential area. Recommended in the evening hours, with the lights that reflect on the river."
Stay away,December 2014,10,Neighborhood Fish Farm,BiminiSea,terrible sick fish poor quality and expensive prices. Never to go back to this place. Total rip off.
If you are around it's OK.,October 2015,40,Neighborhood Fish Farm,ferro01,"It was a pleasant surprise to find something near to take the kids that didn't cost a penny and the kids enjoyed,  now I might have to go back to buy an aquarium!"
Great Place,September 2016,50,Neighborhood Fish Farm,terry p,I bought fish here after learning about the place from my wife.  The fish were a great price and are doing FANTASTIC!!!!  They are happy campers!!!!
Shopping for fish,August 2018,50,Neighborhood Fish Farm,camekac,"First off if you are into fish and building an aquarium, this is the place to visit!!! They have a large variety of everything you need.  The staff are very knowledgeable, nice, and caring!!!"
Great place ,May 2019,50,Neighborhood Fish Farm,eliorojas,"They are knowledgeable, great service and extremely nice , there aquatic fishes look healthy . I’ve been coming here for over 25 years . "
It was okay,March 2018,30,The Miami Circle,Ahems,A small circular archaeological site stuffed in between the river and Hotel district. Not much to see other than information signs and dogs running in and out of the area.
"Dont bother - bad location, bad exhibition, awful",June 2011,10,Museum of Contemporary Art,Blush_123,In Europe this wouldnt be allowed to be called a museum
Dissapointed,August 2011,20,Museum of Contemporary Art,Mike2008Roatan,"Having been to the Salvador Dali museum in Tampa a few days earlier, I found myself wondering in this museum wondering where the art was?"
Great small museum,December 2011,50,Museum of Contemporary Art,pentimento123,Saw the Mark Handforth exhibition. A well curated and thoughtful show. 
great contemporary art Museum,January 2012,50,Museum of Contemporary Art,bgerber948,the museum is relitively small.
Love the Openings!,June 2012,50,Museum of Contemporary Art,Alison K,"I highly recommend going to MOCA's Thursday night show openings. I've been to a few now - great food, fun art, the people are enjoyable, and the staff is knowledgeable."
Miami's oldest history,May 2018,50,The Miami Circle,Arielfl,Today the area around the circle has been turned into a park. The circle itself is 85 percent intact and safe under the dirt. You can see it's outline from the ground. Signs explaining the importance of the area have been added. There is no parking at this site which is a problem if you want to get out of your car and see the site. You risk having your car towed if you attempt to park. It is also difficult to find. You have make a turn like you are pulling into a hotel and cross the hotels traffic until you can make it down a difficult to see side street. All of the aggravation to find the circle is worth it once you step foot on this important historical site and take in the same view of the water that the ancient people did thousands of years ago.
Important piece of history,December 2018,50,The Miami Circle,Sam A,"Incredible story about the preservation of this ancient landmark, as told in the bilingual signs around the area. High rises tower over this ancient site, but the past still remains. An important part of native Miami history!!"
Archeological site,May 2019,40,The Miami Circle,FTMDave,On the other hand there isn't a great deal to see.  The area is a park with two of the lawns being circular to match the archeological remains.
The littlest archeological dig.,September 2019,30,The Miami Circle,Sayeedac1,"A wee place but lots of history and archeology. A circle in a small park, surrounded  by highrise buildings. Fascinating reading of the signposts. Glad that the people could preserve this significant historical site from the predators. "
Lovely church,July 2017,40,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,TheRealGelatoGirl,"...with really nice mosaic and colonial architecture. If you are nearby it is worth going in, but if you live in Europe, there are more impressing churches there. "
Holy Eucharist & Sermon,July 2017,50,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,ndburke,Excellent liturgy accompanied by fantastic music. The organist manifested great skill in his art during the Mass and we sat afterwards and listened to his postlude from music written by Bach.  
OK,December 2018,30,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,BigoBoca,I parked in front of this church while attending Art Miami. It looks like it’s been refurbished on the exterior and it looks OK. Never went in. 
Great Church and Fantastic Evensong Service,January 2019,50,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,11douglast,We were visiting Miami on a weekend and went here as it has some common design elements with our church in NYC as it incorporated elements from a single church in southern France.  Beautiful church redone in 2004.  Inside and out very nice.  The chorale service was excellent and they do it every two weeks on Sunday night.  Moving serivice and nice people.
A diamond in the rough,December 2017,40,Museum of Contemporary Art,robbar13,"MoCa of Miami is filled with great art and the layout for it fits the pieces well. The only downside is the size of the building, I really wished it was bigger. To me, the best part of this museum is the VR art section, it was truly a new experience."
Wonderful Museum for adults and children,February 2018,50,Museum of Contemporary Art,Faith O,Our family loved this museum. We enjoyed all the art we saw and also the lay out and ease of getting around in a very relaxed setting. It is very open and easy to navigate even with small children. With a great location. Parking was easy and there are so many shops and places to eat within walking distance
Monarch Art Exhibit,June 2018,40,Museum of Contemporary Art,gsimpruiz,Interesting exhibit based on artists from the migration path of the Monarch butterfly- from native  Americans throughout the Midwest down to Mexico.
Meh,July 2018,20,Museum of Contemporary Art,Mat C,Honestly was disappointed. A $5 entry per person for a rather dull exhibit. There are far better museums and art galleries in Miami. 
Great Exhibition!,October 2018,50,Museum of Contemporary Art,sarird2018,Charles Gwathmey has taken design to a whole new level - the architects building expansion and design is  wonderful for kids and provides an enjoyable exhibition for all.
"Good option to buy fresh, organic produce if you live in the area",August 2017,40,Coconut Grove Organic Market,WDUK,"I have been here a couple of times now. It's one of the better farmer's markets in the area with a wide selection of fresh produce. Seems like a lot of the produce is from the same farms that Whole Foods carries, and is not local, however the produce is fresher than what you would buy at Whole Foods and that's why we come here. They also have a wide selection of specialty items produced by Glaser Farms including ice-cream, drinks and prepared food. Great quality although expensive especially if you need to eat a lot of vegan food to fill up and feel like you've had a good lunch! It gets very busy under the produce tent with lines of people waiting to pay for their items, but the checkout is efficient and it seems to move quickly. They also have some smaller vendors outside the main produce tent, including lots of vegan food options."
Decent for vegans,December 2017,30,Coconut Grove Organic Market,lucycan,Its smaller than we thought.  If you aren't vegan I would not really bother unless you live local and want to pick up some fruits and vegetables for the week.  We only got juice which was great.  No meat or cheese or eggs in sight.
Vegan’s heaven!,February 2018,50,Coconut Grove Organic Market,nabeab,Only Saturdays and a good lunch option. Worth going!
A little something for everyone,August 2018,50,Coconut Grove Organic Market,MichaelD5164,"The Coconut Grove Farmers Market a neighborhood staple for decades and one of the area's best-kept secrets, there is a little something for everyone, specifically catering to the vegan, vegetarian and/or organic crowd. Many different local food vendors with unique and varied offerings including nut-based, plant-based, dairy-free, vegan desserts, etc. etc. The organic produce selection is more complete than any other farmers market that I've been to. There are other intriguing products and services at this farmers market, such as numerous massage therapists, antiques, jewelry, clothing, extra virgin olive oils and balsamic vinegar from Italy, too! If you've never been, you should check it out. It's every Saturday from 10AM to 6PM."
Overpriced and Uninspiring ,January 2019,30,Coconut Grove Organic Market,Sean O,"I have been to numerous farmers markets from Miami to New York City and this one is lame with a capital L. It's the same produce and boho chic garb week after week. There's very little that's seasonal or artisan in the place and it's all overpriced because someone stuck an ""organic"" label on it. "
Great Atmosphere and Brews,December 2018,50,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,ssulliv5291,"I went there for a friends birthday party and it was a blast. The beer, food, and atmosphere were all very enjoyable. The place is fun, with cool and interesting art all around. The staff was also very nice."
Great spot to hang and have good beer,December 2018,50,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,kellybee104,"Have gone multiple times and have always had a great time here!! The vibe, people, and beer are great! "
Beautiful & Unique Church ,March 2016,50,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,beckaj01,A beautiful church worth a visit in Miami. We divide red this church as we liked out of our Marriott Hotel room window - what a grand view. Of course we then had to walk over & see close up - so very nice. This church is well kept & welcoming. 
Beautiful!,March 2016,40,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,jroddenberry,This cathedral is worth a stop.  Beautiful stained glass and mosaics.  This is an open sanctuary so be respectful.
Historic Episcopal Cathedral,March 2016,50,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,TLMD,"This is the seat of Episcopal diocese of South Florida so it's a very eclectic congregation; however, it's a beautiful building and has undergone a lot of renovations over the past few years.  Please drop in for a visit if you are in the area!"
Easter Sunday service,March 2016,50,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,615louisel,"This is the second time we've attended this cathedral for Easter Sunday services. It is a beautiful cathedral with an inclusive and welcoming culture. It is "" high Episcopal"" with incense and chanting and an awesome choir. It is a wonderfully diverse parish , truly representative of Miami. The church itself is awesome, mosaics from Italy, beautiful stained glass and a stunning altar. We were lucky and the Bishop presided over the service. If you're looking for a church in Miami, give this parish/cathedral a try. "
A great example of classic architecture in a young urban bayside location,February 2016,50,Trinity Episcopal Cathedral,Karen M,Three services on Sunday and noon day services through out the week. Clerics and staff are always friendly and knowledgeable. There is are lots of community cultural events. Check their website for a full listing of events.
WARNING,February 2019,10,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,Road5280travel,"Also, perhaps a little too kid friendly, or maybe parents should supervise them more. Running children might spill my beer."
Unattended children!!??? Why?,May 2019,10,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,jessfiallo,"So guess what guys, I don't recommend Lincoln's beard brewing to anyone. Unless you are 6 years old, thennit is the place for you!"
Super rad local brewery,October 2019,50,Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co.,The_travelingkitten3,"I absolutely love the vibe of this local Miami brewery. The employees are always so friendly and the beer selection is great. I am a huge fan of the Lincoln's Best Ale as well as Avenge Me Red. Jim always goes above and beyond when he's slinging brews! I would keep an eye out for the events taking place here. There is always something going on throughout the week including local music, vendor showcases, and not to mention karaoke wednesdays!! This is a great spot to hang out and enjoy company and some good brews."
A lovely little spot.,July 2018,50,Maurice Gibb Memorial Park,HalClarke,"I've been to this little park a number of times and always enjoy the ambience, a little quiet respite from the to-do of much of South Beach. It's named for a late BeeGee... and it's free."

Respite in Miami,July 2019,50,Museum Park,Annalisad65,"Museum Park is a gorgeous undulating green expanse of 30 acres located in downtown Miami, east of Biscayne Boulevard and hugging the bay. Aptly named, the park is home to the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science and Perez Art Museum Miami (PAMM). Two other cultural institutions, Museum of Art And Design (MOAD) in historic Freedom Tower and the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, are just a few short blocks away. The late and famed architect Zaha Hadid’s One Thousand Museum, a stunning architectural gem, is located directly opposite the park and the American Airlines Arena separates it from Bayfront Park to the south. Museum Park offers a welcome respite from the baking heat of downtown streets where the sound of construction and the constant hum of traffic is omnipresent. I took a long cycle through the park early this July 4th morning. Most people were either sleeping in or away for the long weekend as it was quieter than usual. There are several walking/cycling paths and copses of shade trees throughout the park where permanent outdoor sculptures provide points of interest. The beautiful bay walk stretches all the way from PAMM and connects to a long promenade that serves as the main point of entry to the park. The spectacular 20-foot bronze sculpture, “Flora la Recogedora de Suenos,” dedicated to the City of Miami in 2010, is located at this entrance. Breathtaking views of the ocean as well as the glittering and ever evolving Miami skyline surround the park. Ramps provide access to the museums’ terraces and gardens. There are plenty of benches and shaded spots to relax. Museum Park is flawlessly designed and esthetically pleasing to the eyes. The Metromover has a convenient station stop here and parking is available at the museums. A visit to Museum Park is a downtown must!"
Friendly family church,August 2016,40,St. Raymond Catholic Church,Mariana R,"At times, too Latin. I attend both languages. I prefer English. But, they are very family-oriented, genuine and unpretentious. Nice change from the high-end stuck up churches."
I Love this Church!,October 2016,40,St. Raymond Catholic Church,Not_Always_Italian,"Although this is not my Parish, I love the 9am mass on Sunday. I stumbled upon this church by chance, but keep going back when I can. I love the decor, simple, with beautiful colors. The music and songs at the 9am mass are performed by nuns, and I love their voices. The church is not very big, which makes it more welcoming in my opinion, and has plenty of parking. "
Quaint Church in the Gables,November 2017,50,St. Raymond Catholic Church,afootandahalf,This is a lovely little church in Coral Gables.  If you want Spanish mass then this place is for you.  It also has mass in English but check their schedule.  
St Raymond,February 2018,40,St. Raymond Catholic Church,NoraWetzstein,"St Raymond is one of my favorite churches.  Is located in a nice and quiet Neighborhood and parishioners are mostly locals.  Simple, quiet, no nonsense."
simple but expensive,May 2019,30,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,American_bullit,"Great to spare a peaceful moment, but expensive for what you get."
So much fun!,October 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,Simara,"Beautiful mall. Went to listen to live music. It was so much fun. There are plenty of stores, many restaurants and bars. Enough to spend the whole day and night shopping and having fun. "
Not friendly shopping center,October 2019,10,Dolphin Mall,Nikkor99,Not worth your headache. Nothing worth your time and money. Go to a local Burger King or McDonalds for dinner.
Great mall,November 2018,50,Dolphin Mall,travelingbugs10,Great mall to walk around and many shops to go to. There are also good restaurants and 2 minis theaters. My son loves coming here as well.
Decent Mall,September 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,Nattysimps,Decent mall. They have all your typical stores and brands. Its a large mall and can be very crowded. Good luck with the parking too
Shopping for everyone! And entertainment too!!,October 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,njmedia2,"The Dolphin Mall is almost it’s own destination resort. I say this because of the extensive size and number of options that this unique mall offers its patrons. From the super high end to the cost effective shopping options, there are stores for every taste and budget. In addition there is a movie theater, bowling alley and Dave & Busters as well. Lots of food, too! Great place for hot or rainy days, or when you’re looking for anything from jewelry to hunting items to clothing to gifts... and more."
Great Free Transport in Miami,August 2019,50,Metromover,Mduque74,Congratulations for this project!
Good to Park and Use The Mover around Downtown,September 2019,40,Metromover,Daya M,"It was great to park and then use the mover around downtown for a “day in our town” with our kids. We went to Frost Museum, Miami court house, 1st library and Brickell place for dinner. It was cleaned and during the day felt save. Lots of business people and tourists riding."
mrs,September 2019,50,Metromover,Zohe C,And enjoy all the free transportation around the city.
This is the best of my tax dollars at work.,September 2019,50,Metromover,Tom R,This is free! Need I say more? It serves a limited area in and around downtown Miami. It has helped make Downtown Miami more walker friendly. Did I forget to mention it’s free!
Fantastic free transport,August 2019,50,Metromover,Purplemusky,We used the metro mover during our  Miami stay in August and it was a great way to travel.  It’s free and a great way to get around at no expense.
Nice Surprise,July 2019,50,Espanola Way,enaclements,"Stumbled across this place while looking for a place to eat. Spoiled for choice. Italian restaurant at the end especially good. Friendly and helpful. Can""t remember the name.  Owners do the cooking and serving. Highly recommended. Entertainment going on in pathway."
A great place to eat and hang out,July 2019,50,Espanola Way,Sonia F,This happening area in South Beach is the perfect place to get a nice meal in a lively environment. There are lots of excellent restaurants competing for your attention. The atmosphere is more relaxed and classier than the boisterous Ocean Drive. 
Espanola Way,July 2019,40,Espanola Way,TaherAlbaghliJulian,"It is Three blocks south of Lincoln Road—South Beach’s other famed pedestrian corridor—Española Way is found between 14th and 15th Streets and offers a completely different experience. With bougainvillea climbing facades and artful friezes running the length of the buildings, the narrow street is quaint and intimate, begging you to linger and take it all in."
Debatable,August 2019,30,Espanola Way,ReneeSaliba,having said that I still recommend this street to go and have a look as well as maybe a drink of two during happy hour.
Like entering another city,July 2019,50,Espanola Way,foodfan131313,"Espanola Way, a pedestrian only street lined with outdoor restaurants is a world away from bustling Washington Street or Collins Ave.  Too bad its only one block.  Worth the walk a few blocks from Lincoln Road."
Gloria Gaynor Concert,April 2019,50,Miami Design District,claudiash1,I recommend parking in the parking lot of the place.
Great for shopping,April 2019,50,Miami Design District,TandTSwitzerland,This neighborhood has become a very nice area for high end shopping- a competition to Bal Harbour. Nice design of most of the houses and some nice galleries and also museums to visit. 
Shopping and Art Appreciation,April 2019,50,Miami Design District,sassafrasblue46,My teen daughters and I enjoyed an afternoon of exploring the upscale retailers and unique art galleries of the Miami Design District. All the merchants and curators were warm and welcoming. It was fun to walk through art both indoors and out! Plus the parking garage was convenient and inexpensive. We will definitely return on our next trip to Miami.
High End 4 $URE!,May 2019,50,Miami Design District,Louis G,Bal Harbour's rival.  This is the new scene in high end designer browsing or shopping if you looking for that something $pecial! 
Photographers paradise,May 2019,40,Miami Design District,Gatorartlady,Stroll the design district after dark and bring your camera.  There are beautiful photo spots around every corner.  If you get tired of walking take an escalator upstairs and relax in the swings.
beautiful garden,February 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Miami666,"beautiful garden at 1 bloc from Lincoln Road, just behind the Holocaust Hand ! Incredible garden with perfect maintenance. each plants and trees are different, very good place to breath !!"
Tiny garden but a great variety of plants,February 2019,30,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Btravel05,It took us 20mn to make the tour of the whole place (looking at plants and enjoying the respite from the heat). There are some exhibitions at the center.
Gem of Harmony in Miami,March 2019,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,debbrunetti,"The Miami Beach Botanical Gardens are a small gem in the middle of the city, near the convention center. Within its boundaries are beautifully-kept grounds alive with myriad plants, flowers and butterflies! The gardens provide a really nice place to walk and enjoy nature. Maurice in the Boutique was awesome as well! He helps facilitate events on site, and it appears as if the Botanical Gardens offer a beautiful option and more affordable venue."
So many butterflies and flowers!,March 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Paige D,"This was my first time visiting a botanical garden in city, so I don’t have a whole lot to compare it to, but I loved it! It seemed a bit small, but it is in South Beach so understandably there’s not a lot of open space. It felt like walking into a calm oasis of lush green plants, colorful flowers, and more butterflies than I’ve ever seen in my life. The koi fish in the ponds were lovely too. The string lights looked nice and I bet it’s a gorgeous place at night as well. For free, it’s a quite amazing little spot to see if you’re in the area!"
Sun starved visitors from NY,February 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,CSSnowshoer,"Nothing is more magical than coming from the cold north to this little oasis. Butterflies! We just wanted to hug them all. They were everywhere. We were there on a weekday at noon. There seemed to be a lot of regular visitors, based on the comments I heard. I would come often also if I lived in Miami. Loved the water features. "
Little Havana,August 2019,50,Little Havana,Sunni D,Balls and Chains so much fun along with other great bars and food with live bands. Great place to go day or night
Lively neighborhood,August 2019,50,Little Havana,Worldalert,"If you are in Miami, you have to visit ""Little Havana"".   It is a Cuban neighborhood and you will learn the culture of the Cuban people.  Best food and best people.  You have to be a part of this culture while in Miami.   They make the best tobaccos.   Ball & Chain has a live band, but it gets too packed on the weekends.  The food is amazing at Cafe La Trova.   There are so many restaurants and bars to pick from.  Also, you have to watch the people play at Domino Park.   They play dominoes very competitively.  This is a must to see.   Highly recommend Little Havana if you are visiting Miami."
Little Havana,September 2019,50,Little Havana,Joebiko,Wonderful energy in this area. We went to Ball and Chain on a Tuesday night...mellow vibes. Then we walked on Calle Ocho for a few blocks. Everyone we met was pleasant and happy to be there.
Best Little Havana,September 2019,50,Little Havana,SharanSharan,loved the vibes!!
Useless,May 2019,10,Miami Trolley,Amit P,What a completely garbage system. Never on time. Waited 25 min to get one to watch it just drive by and not even attempt to stop even after we tried to flag it down. Great to have a system. Uselss if they won't stop. Had to grab an Uber. Should have just don't that and saved myself the effort. 
Free transport in Miami Beach,May 2019,40,Miami Trolley,Bikerbrum,These little busses are easy to recognise and do circuits of Miami Beach. As the go in circles you cannot get lost  and its great for sightseeing. There are 3 routes that cross each  other North  Mid and South so its very easy to get around.. They can get packed with the locals going to and from work but that adds to the experience.
Another Free Service,May 2019,50,Miami Trolley,Chris M,Used the trolley to move from Biscayne Bay to another location close by. No cost. Nice and cool inside with a very friendly driver. Very convenient and the trolleys go all over the place.
No cost experience!,June 2019,50,Miami Trolley,zahl87,"Good transportation between different areas of Miami beach. Highly recommended, on time and friendly drives. Have aircondition.And its free - what more to ask for?"
Fun Ride for sightseeing,June 2019,50,Miami Trolley,sbmorg01,Enjoyed the trolley rides and easy way to learn your way around Miami.  Locals and tourists seemed to appreciate and much easier to find places you wanted to spend more time.
One of my favs in south beach,September 2017,40,Britto Central,Maria L,"Love Britto and love lincoln road, just a great vibe. Great art, some quite affordable, some not so much. But beautiful nervetheless."
Happy place,November 2017,50,Britto Central,Ruth F,What a lot of fun the two shops were.  There is something to buy whatever your budget from key rings to original works of art. Obviously the art has to be to your taste and we happen to like the bright colours. We found the knowledge of the sales team to be excellent and the artist's story very touching.
Fallen In Love with Romero Britto Art,December 2017,50,Britto Central,markjanine2017,"Britto is my sister-in law's favorite artist and when my wife and I visited her in Pikesville MD she introduced us to his art. We have fallen in love with his works and they truly make you feel happy and uplift your soul and mood giving one hope for the future. We recently visited the gallery on Lincoln Road, South Beach, Miami and was so inspired that we purchased an Open Edition Digital Print of the Hamsa in Yellow which is hand signed by the artist. My wife also purchased a Hamsa t-shirt and a puzzle for our grandchildren. The service from Kassey and Eric was commendable and nothing was too much for them to do for us. We will definitely be back for more when we next visit Miami."
World class,December 2017,50,Britto Central,rauld81,This is the exposition of a world class designer. My wife has a bunch of stuff from this brand so it was a good surprise for here when I took her here. 
Britto is Miami!,December 2017,50,Britto Central,Tim F,I love this guy and all of his work!!  This store is a perfect place to buy something to remind you of how unique South Beach is - his art is know worldwide and he is even doing the Hulls of the NCL cruise ships.  
Relaxing!,December 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Julialibhaber,"My family came to this beach in the morning. The temperature was great, the water was refreshing, and overall the experience was very relaxing. "
Some cool Beach,April 2016,30,Bal Harbour Beach,Daemae,Very calming atmosphere...over looking some ritzy neighborhoods. The tides was petty mild compared to the other sides and the beaches.
Everyone have to visit Bal Harbour Beach,January 2017,50,Bal Harbour Beach,660irinan,"Everyone have to visit Bal Harbour Beach! Nice place, clean, people love this place, in the medle of Aventura and Ocean drive."
An amazing beach,March 2016,50,Bal Harbour Beach,buddhakouri,You have great hotels and you have shopping. The best hotel in this area is the St. Regis. Bal Bay is a community of homes across the street from the beach. 
"Great Museum, great pieces!",February 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Travelaround59,"The Wolfsonian has great pieces on exhibition with a story to go trough and everything is wonderfully explained that you can go knowing “almost everything” that you need to know. The Art Deco pieces are amazing and having a collection of 80,000 pieces you wonder what you will be able to see next. For sure a place where you can return every time you are in town. Amazing!"
An Art Deco Lovers Delight!,February 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,JoelBx,"This museum presents a marvelous collection of Art Deco artifacts from around the world. Paintings, Iron entrance gates, statuary, household items, home designs, and much more! This is a must visit in South Beach."
Wolfsonian is an Art Deco paradise!,March 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,arcadiapix,"Miami is a surprisingly sophisticated destination -- i had no idea there would be so many wonderful museums, theaters, bookstores etc. But my hands-down favorite is this compact gem of a design museum, dedicated to the seductive streamlined charm of Art Deco.  Conveniently located right in the middle of South Beach, it's a gorgeously renovated warehouse building that at any given time has 2 or 3 exhibitions, plus an excellent program of films and lectures.  And don't miss the fabulous gift shop/ bookstore, which pleasingly adjoins an excellent tiny bar offering well-priced shots of bourbon and other treats.  Enjoy!"
Wolfsonian full of art deco wonders,March 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Stay59953079999,"The Wolfsonian is full of both grand and everyday art deco wonders. The museum covers art, architecture, furniture, and inventions of everyday life--from toasters to elegant tea services designed for royalty. I was surprised by many things invented during the art deco period that we depend on today. The arrangement and presentation of the collections is easy to walk through and the explanations are short but informative. The museum itself is a beautiful example of art deco style."
"A fascinating, if rather odd museum",March 2019,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Joe O,"This museum collects 20th century design pieces & 20th century political memorabilia. It is a fascinating, if rather odd & eclectic collection. Well worth a visit if only to escape from the hedonistic chaos of South Beach for a couple of hours. "
"Cool to see and know about, but not accessible to the general public",January 2017,50,Fisher Island,Bookieman68,Fisher Island is the highest per capita income by household in the United States.  A Segway tour guide will tell you about the history of Fisher Island.  
Where some of the rich and famous live,January 2017,40,Fisher Island,Usia2014,"It's interesting to see Fisher Island and the massive condo structures, exclusive homes to the rich and famous. We sailed past it twice on the ship and the skyline views were great for taking some cool photos. A lot of wealth on such a small island. You can take a boat tour around it that explains the area history about the island and those that live there now."
Interesting to see,February 2017,40,Fisher Island,RomaL77,I did a bus and boat tour that included Fisher Island. I enjoyed seeing where the rich stay when in Miami.
Paradise inside Miami,July 2016,50,Fisher Island,juan c,"I went there because of a fancy wedding  and it looks that you are in paradise. The landscape marvelous and buildings.  Most of the people used golf carts to move around d the island and it is super chic and security there amazing. I saw kids walking by theirselves with no nannies and they do have their own shopping account so they don't use cash. Daddy will come to square THE account every week I do assume hahaha nobody is in a hurry, nobody looks stress out everything I saw was peace! Sorry but you can come only with an invitation so they'll check you out at the ferry station with security. $$$$$ all around"
LOW ENERGY BUT NICE GETAWAY WITH THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE,November 2016,40,Fisher Island,Jim N,Everything on  Fisher Island is 1st Class.  The beach is great and the bar that fronts the beach is marvelous. The Italian Restaurant is probably the best in town and the marina store offers a nice breakfast. All of the facilities are top notch and from the moment you arrive you will get the very best service in town by a staff who really cares that you enjoy yourself. Now for the BUT.  Most people there are residents who are plus 50. They would rather not have non-residents visit. They are not interested in meeting or conversing with non-residents. So if you are going there to spend time with your date with your attention focused on each other ....this is a great place.
I bought this as a present!,August 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Uriel05,"I bought this as a gift for someone and received videos through the tour. I could hear the conversations. The guides and handlers were absolutely amazing! Very nice and patient! They introduced the animals, explained their traits, and answered questions. Great experience all around!"
ZWF Experience,September 2019,10,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,kayb0521,"I just left from visiting ZWF and my boyfriend and I are highly disappointed. We visited from DC just to come here and it was the worst experience ever. Let's start from the beginning, we arrived at 11:45 for our scheduled encounter at 12. However, our encounter didn't start until 1:30, an hour and half after our scheduled time. This definitely messed up our day. Not to mention you have to wait outdoors in the heat. Next, the bathrooms were out of order. The only bathrooms on the property and they were out of order. Now here it is 1:30 we are finally called to come on back. So we are excited and waiting to play with the tiger and take pics outdoors in the green grassy area as we saw the people before us do. After waiting about another 15 minutes we are guided into a small white confined room where we are told we have to be. What a disappointment! We were told that because the last two tours were outside, the tiger was overheated. Why schedule tours back to back?! There should have been a grace period in between each one or do half of the 5 min encounter indoors and half outdoors to make it fair. I'm very upset and wanted to come back but now this is something I have to scratch off my list. There wasn't any apologies, extra accommodations or anything for having us wait an hour and half for a terrible encounter."
Birthday present for family,September 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Melanie B,Thank you all for helping these animals and making a difference.
Never disappoints,September 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Orlando5656,This was our 4th return trip to ZWF. We did the Feline experience with the white cub. What a wonderful creature... tons of personality and charm. Looking forward to our next trip.
"Best place to
Visit",September 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,O V,"Love ZWF. My husband and I have been there many times and given it as a gift to family and friends and never get tired of this place.  Limbani is one of our favorites, we’ve had a few encounters with him but this last Saturday he was so much fun now at 3 years old. Also met Karuna, the white tiger and they were both awesome.  The staff is always very professional and nice and  really help the visitors Love that now we can sign all the consent forms online, very organized and saved us and the staff time.  Keep up the good work."
art Basel now is art circus,December 2017,50,Art Basel,reggiecasagrande,"i love coming to art basel, but over the last decade it has become battle of the brands in terms of events, traffic and experiences.    A great chic crowd, amazing art, but plan on lots of time to get around as traffic and prices are awful."
Very Impressive Show,December 2017,40,Art Basel,Redenzo,"If you enjoy mostly modern art and some cutting edge works as well- this show is an interesting mix of Miro, Picasso, Calder and the like as well as great selection of Cuban artists- well worth the time to see the show.  It is rather large so you want to give yourself at least 4 to 6 hours to check it out.   "
FAAAAAABULOUS!!,December 2017,50,Art Basel,traveltrackers,Originally began atthe convention center but now encompasses every area of Miami Dade County. Worth every penny of admissions if you enjoy art and museums and intermingling of great food
I love it !,September 2018,50,Art Basel,Daniela H,Since I love art this is a great event that comes every year to the city of miami beach. The only thing is that to park is horrible and very expensive. Other than that it is very fun and it has a friendly atmosphere. 
A must see!,October 2018,50,Art Basel,Gordan B,"Now with the Newly Renovated Miami Beach Convention Center this will be the best place for Art Basel. I go every year to different places to view the arts and I am not disappointed. Since this place is so close to my Chiropractic office in Miami Beach, Cafe of life Chiropractic I will definitely be checking out the art work here. It will be the nicest venue in Miami."
Frustrating with traffic but fun to watch,July 2017,30,Brickell Avenue Bridge,jennifersM2640UC,We watched this bridge mess with traffic every day and way too often but the kids had a blast watching it go up and down for the boats. 
"Go and Experience ""Forever Celia"" Oct. 20, 2018-Mar. 31, 2019",November 2018,50,American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora,Mikesugarsugar,"This is a temporary exhibit that ends March 31, 2019. Go before it ends. Take the time to enjoy Celia's life and accent to being one of the worlds greatest musicians. You're going to need at least three hours to enjoy this wonderful exhibit. Besides the her attire, shoes, wigs and many awards, there is a 1-1/2 hour endless loop movie that is worth just the visit. If you're a fan of hers, Salsa music or The Fania record label history, this movie is a must. It's just a lot of fun."
An Amazing Street,November 2015,50,Calle Ocho Festival,ChALUTCH,"We have been coming to Calle Ocho for over 30 years,neither one of us are actually Cuban,but we both have Cuban relatives nearby that we have learned from.People come here and see nothing and complain,you need to know when and where to go.Friday evenings between 7 and midnight are very good.During the day most of the cigar shops are open and some welcome visitors to watch as the workers hand roll the cigars right in front of you.The Domino Park is always a highlight for the tourist,but ask before you take a photo,they almost always say yes.The best time to go is during the Calle Ocho Festival,usually the third Sunday in March,you will never forget this festival,it goes for miles and miles with non stop Music and FOOD."
Great Way Across the Bay,November 2019,40,MacArthur Causeway Bridge,Thomas V,"This is the major route to Miami Beach, a very long bridge that will take you across the bay harbor and along the way you will enjoy some great views of the skylines of both cities."
Mass with an Excellent Choir,December 2016,50,St Patrick Catholic Church,davidpC6878JH,"When was the last time that you participate in a Mass? If you want to experience a nice community with a great choir, Sunday mass at 11am.  If by chance you are Christmas Eve or for Eastern, it is even better.  For Christmas Eve usually there is a concert at 11 pm before Mass.  The church has been renovated in a south colonial style."
Don't want to Come To This hotel!,July 2019,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Girlwonder1016,"I wish I had read the reviews before I paid for this hotel. I am bringing my husband there for his birthday for 4 nights. Now I want my money back! According to the other reviewers, this place is nasty, dirty, with rude people, horribly renovated showers and bathtubs, and their gaming machines don't work! Plus it's far away from everything and cost a fortune to get to where everything is. Plus $50 from the airport???  This trip is going to be very miserable and I hope  can get my money back. I don't want my husband to spend his birthday in misery!"
Fantastic!,April 2019,50,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",DragonGrl75,I would highly recommend this loop!
Potential to spot wildlife?,November 2018,30,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",FraserCambridge,"I have to qualify my review as we only drove a section of the loop road. Our entry point was NOT at Monroe Station, but at the other end where the road is paved for about 7 miles into the loop. It goes past numerous developed dwellings for a couple of miles before it gets to the swamp proper. After about 5 miles of swamp scenery on both sides, although interesting, we turned back. I expect the further you go on the loop the greater the chances of seeing wildlife are, but apart from birds and fish we didn’t see any."
Better ways to spend time,April 2017,10,Casino Miami,Kerry N,The casino looks like it's going out of business.  Vast amounts of open space.  Almost entirely penny machines.  Video blackjack sucks.  Only positive is that it's smoke free.
Not what I expected....Horrible pricey food,October 2015,20,Pinto's Farm,May D,"For now, I am glad I gave it a try, but will definitely not be back."

Lovely couple as owners and amazing art!,December 2017,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,Upekkhapr,Gainza really knows how to explore his art and present it in amazing new ways! We stoped by to look into the store and my boyfriend as an artist ended up talking with Agustin and I being a writer and life coach ended up talking to his wife Maria! Charming people and a piece of art for everyone at the store! The coffee is also really tasty! Stop by and find your favorite piece of art!
Ok but needs help!,September 2018,20,The Wynwood Marketplace,mwooduk,"Lots of cool bars and food trucks but the area floods badly and the toilets were disgusting and unusable.  No lights inside, no toilet paper and filthy.....will be writing to Swarm to complain.  Food was good from the trucks we used but slow service and pricey.  $15 for two tiny pork belly buns and a bottle of water - same for a tiny Cuban sandwich but because it's Wynwood and trendy it's $$$. Would not return but glad we went as met the most gorgeous puppy!!"
In the heart of Coconit Grove,May 2016,50,Peacock Park,Miamismith305,"Beautiful place to spend time alone, with your better half or family. Here you will find a playground, baseball field and a view of the ocean. Only a quarter of a mile from the shops and restaurants. "
Nice park!,June 2013,50,A. D. Barnes Park,Bobby B,"This little park is very nice! There is a lot to see in this park, a lot of birding and biking in this park. If you want to jog in a park this is the perfect place!"
Positives and Negatives,June 2014,30,A. D. Barnes Park,MrMiamiExplorer,"I had passed by this park for years, but never had time to visit. Now finally I was in the area for an appointment and decided to explore this park. Firstly admission and parking are Free. There is a playground, lake, fishing area, pool, jogging trails, and lots of wide open green space for recreation. Being a wildlife lover I was most interested in seeing the nature trails and Nature Center. Unfortunately that afternoon the nature center was closed but I didn't miss much, as the nature center was basically a tiny shack with a trailer next to it. The nature trails through the preserved pine forest were beautiful with a few exceptions. I did not see much wildlife, with the exception of lizards, and clearly saw the reason why. The forest is completely infested with  stray cats. Every few feet I would encounter another one. These feral felines are gobbling up the native wildlife and destroying this sensitive ecosystem. I would suggest that the park service trap them because in addition to them decimating the native animal population, they are a danger to guests because of the threat of rabies. It is only a matter of time before a child tries to pet a sick one and gets bitten. There was also lots of trash strewn everywhere throughout the forest trails, which had not been maintained. Most disturbing was that there were signs along the trails of Santeria and/or Satanic rituals being performed in the forest, I assume at night. Along the trail in a few different places I saw mutilated chicken carcasses, some partially in plastic bags, which were attracting the stray cats even more. This gave me the creeps! With some improvements, this park could be an even better place."
Don't miss when visiting the Everglades!!,February 2018,50,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",Skeets37,"Located a short way from the Oasis Visitor center of Big Cypress Preserve, this is a must see 24 mile loop drive thru the Preserve. You will see tons of exotic birds and of course alligators. On the day I went on a morning drive on a Tuesday only saw 1 other car. If you  are visiting the northern portion of the Everglades do not miss taking the time on this drive!"
Loop road great gator viewing,April 2018,50,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",jennyb001,"Unsealed road in very good condition and virtually no other cars... we drove along at 12-17 mph and that allowed us to see so much wildlife. If you want great free viewing, this is a couple of hours well spent.  If you are unable to cope with a slow quiet drive don’t bother making dust for nothing!"
Interesting Family Contemporary Art Collection,December 2015,30,Rubell Family Collection,TalesFromTheRoad,"Visited many times- like the Margulies Collection, diverse collection of different media.  They rotate samples from their collection to reflect different themes.  This year it was female artists.  Worth visiting and located near the Margulies."

A Pleasant Surprise!,January 2019,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Eric H,"We visited the Everglades and this hotel came up as a choice. It was a little further west that I wanted. But then we walk in to this beautiful hotel. We end up in a suite like room as well which was really nice. The location ended up being perfect for the airboat tour and the Everglades. The casino allowed smoking so that was VERY uncomfortable. Very nice pool and hot tub (indoors). Kids daycare like facility as well. The arcade was 70% out of order though, but you can rent game consoles."
Best Casino in Florida,February 2019,50,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,jimmy6621,"If you really want to win, Miccosukee Casino and Gaming gives you the best odds to be a Winner!!! If your a high roller or just out to have a good time and not spend a fortune, they have it all!!!For as little as 5 cents you can in big there!!! They also got the best buffet of any casino with the best variety of ood!!!!"
"Checked out the buffet, no smoke there",December 2018,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,burntweeniesandwich,"Decided to stop by on the way to the Keys, as the casino is on our back road route around the Miami turnpike nightmare, so thought we would stop in briefly, mostly just to check out the buffet, since buffets in Vegas can be a good deal, in my experience. We arrived right about noon on a Friday in December. The parking lot seemed completely full, as far as we could see, and we were lucky to get a spot near the entrance as someone else was pulling out. First you notice the sign, near the entrance, indicating that the valet service is $7, ouch, guess we were lucky to find a space not far from the door. On entering the building a faint odor of smoke is perceived which grows stronger as one approaches the gaming floor. Take a right up the escalator to the second floor and you arrive at a large bar on the left (no one was there but the bartender), walk to the right and you arrive at the buffet. Looked pretty good to me, fair selection of items, not busy at all considering this was lunch time. I didn't actually eat, since we had very recently enjoyed a large breakfast, but it did look appealing, and the price seemed about right for the offerings. Also I smelled no smoke in the buffet area, this was one of my purposes; to see if one could eat here without the stench of cigarettes interfering with eating, since a lot of people had mentioned cigarette smoke being a problem at the casino on TA. I don't think that would be an issue in the buffet area. I then went back down to the first floor to check out the snack area which is to the left, down the corridor, as you enter, cigarette smoke was strong there. I then went to the deli to look at the menu, smoke was also present here. The dessert display in the counter looked appealing, so I ordered a bread pudding to go. It was kind of expensive, but was a fairly large portion, actually enough for two people to share, and it was pretty good. The entire facility that I observed is attractive, and clean in appearance. Keep in mind this was noon on a Friday, I did not see a lot of people on the gaming floor, so was a bit surprised by the smoke being so prominent. I assume the fact that the gaming floor appearing not very busy means the cars in the lot were representative of the people staying at the hotel doing something else at the time. I wonder what the smoke is like when the game floor is fully occupied! My wife accompanied me up to check out the buffet, but refused to go with me to check out the snack and deli installations, because of the smoke odor. Guess we won't ever be gaming there. As you can see, neither of us are big on cigarette smoke. Having enjoyed gambling in Vegas, I know there are ways to deal with the cigarette smoke, as many places there are fine for free breathing, in spite of people smoking everywhere, but apparently Miccosukee has not employed those advanced air circulation methods. Too bad, it would be fun to stop and do some gambling on the way to and from the Keys, but we still might stop by someday for the buffet."
Interesting Air Museum that honours military and civilian aviation,January 2012,40,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,RachNorfolk,We then went outdoors and looked at the large black plane. It was a seaplane which needed restoring. We spent about 1 hour and 15 minutes looking round the museum and really enjoyed it. Thought the entrance fee was sensible. As you exit you go back through the gift shop which has rest rooms which we used. When we were at the museum we were the only visitors there which was quite a surprise. Maybe because it was January and most people had gone back to work. I am glad I went here as it was very interesting. As we were leaving we saw the men pulling a plane outdoors that they were going to fly that day. I think this place is more for adults as kids may get abit bored after a while. If you are into flying and planes and the history of planes you will love it all. I am not that into it but I really enjoyed it( hubby is more into planes etc than me). Well worth going to . They also hold events during the year that maybe worth going to.
Good but small,December 2014,40,Peacock Park,Curtez151,good little park near the water and yacht club. small park. can place soccer or whatever sports. small parking lot adjacent to the park. nice place if you live in the area.
not much worth seeing for $10 admission,August 2012,10,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,solaris_pete,"Nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend this ""attraction"" for $10. My kids were 14 and 12 so they were all charged adult rate... $40 for 20 min of walk around??!! Come on..."
great location and experience....,August 2012,50,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,demoore17,"great place to introduce flight history to children, I take my son every weekend to tour the hangar. great collection of scale models and very helpful staff."
Very little to see,May 2013,30,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,Robert M,The gift shop is in serious need of a renovation and their souvenirs are uninspiring. You can see the entire museum in 20 minutes and you will leave feeling uninspired.
Off the beaten path,June 2013,50,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,rethlaw,Although still rebuilding after hurricaine Andrew there are nifty little planes to see.  Just having the sea plane on display was reason enough for us to go.
Interesting and out of the ordinary,July 2016,50,The Kampong,marta03_2_12,"beautiful gardens bay view a great hidden treasure in Miami - Coconut Grove for families, group of friends, couples wonderful outing"
The Kampong is a Special Place,March 2017,50,The Kampong,HistoryLover2017,"I am so glad I visited the Kampong Gardens.  Our guide Roger was excellent - very knowledgeable, teaching our group a great deal and all with a dash of humor.  We had a lot of fun.  The Kampong has many fruit bearing trees and it was great to see them all in their natural state - usually I just see these fruits at the supermarket!  The Kampong is a labor of love and when you go don't miss seeing the old laboratory filled with botany equipment from the early 1900s.  You will enjoy this garden if you are a garden lover.  The Kampong has a mysterious quality because many of the trees and plants are from exotic places far away.  Do not miss this unique spot - there are few like it in the US!"
Hidden gem.,March 2017,50,The Kampong,Rebecca W,"Start by reading about David Fairchild. He is a very important figure in American history that no one has ever heard of. It helps to understand the propery, and it's signifigance. Located in a beautiful part of Miami on Biscayne Bay.You need a reservation, and it is gated. So you have to be buzzed in. Property is beautiful, pack a picnic so you can spend some time, and take the guided tour."
Overpriced for what is offered,March 2018,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Tina W,The room was very nice but that is about all.
"Safe, food ok.. good atmosphere....clean but very smoky",September 2017,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Qomomoko,"Also played poker once or twice, dealers are nice."
a crap and a scam,May 2018,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Camionero C,do not waste your money on these machines that you're going to lose everything
It was OK,June 2018,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Rhondalove,This casino was smoky and it was very small compare to others but I would not be back. They have a lounge you can listen too some music but if you are on the machines you would stay thirsty because no waitress or waiter came around to ask anything.
Not enough different machines,July 2018,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,blsdjs,The hotel is really nice and very clean!  The casino doesn't have any poker slots or Keno which is a shame.  We went to Hard Rock to be able to enjoy those.  Disappointing
Watching Jai Alai,June 2015,40,Casino Miami,Silvia T,I enjoyed watching the Jai Alai. Did not bet on matches but had fun watching. Glad I went. I did play slot machines. Lost $10. 
David Fairchild's Beautiful  Home and Gardens,June 2016,50,The Kampong,Hartee H,Definitely worth a visit.
Beautiful and unusual gardens,October 2015,50,The Kampong,sherryet2016,The Kampong is a hidden gem located in Coconut Grove. The property was bought by Dr. David Fairchild where he introduced and grew many tropical trees and plants.  It is a lovely garden right on Biscayne Bay where you can wonder along the paths down to the water. 
Wonderful gardens and setting,May 2016,50,The Kampong,Jeffrey H,"Dreamy, romantic and wonderful, the Kampong is worth a visit.  The eccentric house is terrific and the grounds are lushly planted."
Nice tropical setting,September 2016,40,The Kampong,mrichardm2016,Wasn't sure of the name but the photo looks like the place we went.  Nice tropical gardens and a quiet place to walk.
Historical Garden of Eden,December 2016,50,The Kampong,Emmanuelle L,"The Kampong is not only an exceptionally beautiful tropical place, it is also the former home and compound of early 20th century herbalist and explorer Fairchild, whose office and laboratory have been recently restored by artist Mark Dion. Treat yourself to a walk in this peaceful paradisiac reserve and to a visit in this carefully reconstructed research lab with original manuscrits and tools."
play,January 2015,50,Casino Miami,Eduardo D,"well the first time I went I won 380.00, the games are easy to play, the atmosphere was very pleasant and they also play music."
Live Jai-alai is very exciting!,October 2015,30,Casino Miami,shesplicer,"A bit run down, but the excitement of the game is worth it! There is nothing like live Jai-alai and I'm glad we made the trip to Miami! The casino is not run down and the people who work there are very nice. It's a nice way to spend the day!"
"Not swanky, but see (and bet on if you want) Jai-alai- a sport that is integral to Miami's historic identity",December 2015,40,Casino Miami,TalesFromTheRoad,"From the opening sequence of the TV series ""Miami Vice"" through a history of legalized gambling in Florida, have always been intrigued by Jai-alai.  You can park for free in the lot across the street from the casino, walk in and watch matches for free.  Very cool and worth a stop."
Not terrible,March 2014,30,Casino Miami,sarahparedes,I checked out their website in advace of going and they have alot of promotions going on where they give out CASH to random players with their card in the machines.
Great place for a concert,June 2014,50,Casino Miami,Jenn A,"Went for the Dennis DeYoung concert. This is the most amazing venue for a concert. The granite walls provide the perfect acoustics and the sound was amazing, almost like an amphitheater. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The décor is dated, but in a retro kind of way, but the venue was clean. The chairs in the stands are a bit small with not too much leg room for tall people, but I wouldn’t mind returning and watching another concert here."
Eh...meal was ok,December 2017,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,jerrys572,I was traveling back from driving the Everglades and evening traffic was horrible. Stopped to burn off some time to let the traffic clear. $30 club play and coupons in which I ate at the buffet for half price. I’ll review next. As for the casino the games were very old and the overall setting was cramped. I ‘think’ they comp drinks but I didn’t stick around long as I didn’t like the overall vibe. If I lived here I doubt I would return. 
Avoid this place!!!,January 2018,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,antqlamp,"After a long day of sightseeing, we stopped for the night on our way across southern FL from Miami to Naples because of its location. We thought we'd get a nice bed and a great dinner. However, as soon as we walked in, the cigarette smoke from the casino was overpowering. That should have been our first clue. At dinner, we opted for the buffet because the fine dining restaurant was way over-priced. As it turns out, that was probably a bad decision because the buffet was mediocre at best with old food and a minimal selection. Beyond that, the service was poor and the staff unfriendly. In the end, however, I am happy to say that our room was clean and well appointed."
The moment you see this place you know something is wrong !,January 2018,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Tom B,Miccosukee means = Not for me.
Very disappointed ,February 2018,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Jenkwfl1,"Arrived at hotel at 7:30 pm 2/16/18. A large group was checking in so I chose to play the slots versus standing in line.  The machines were 75% not working.  I finally found a suitable machine.  After an hour, I went to check in.  An agent came from around the desk and asked for my ID.  He went back, made a copy and handed it to me.  What happens to my ID after I check out, I thought?  I work in a hotel and I know this is an unusual procedure.  Back to check in, I received an upgrade. Which I thought was generous until I got to my room and realized a Latin Party with music playing that could be heard for miles was across from my room.  No worries, I can settle in the bedroom and watch tv.  The tv in the bedroom would not work.  So, I ordered room service which was quick and the attendant was pleasant.  Woke up at 8:45am and thought I would hit the slots before a ride home and the casino was roped off.  Very unfortunate.  I normally have a good experience at this hotel.  The rooms are tired, the machines are tired and parking is limited.  Might consider other hotel options next time."
Breakfast,March 2018,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,adventures4243,"I do not like the gambling portion of the casino. It reeks of smoke as soon as you walk in the door, it's all over the 1st floor."
Beautiful botanical park on the water,May 2015,50,The Kampong,Charliep57,"A beautiful botanical garden, with lots of rare species and a historic house.  Great venue for weddings or events.  Right on Biscayne Bay."
Beautiful site to relax ,February 2016,50,The Kampong,Attila K,This is one of the most beautiful places next to vizcaya and the botanical garden! The history is very interesting and there are actually students living and studying on the premises! The point view is absolutely breathtaking!
A Hidden Attraction!,April 2016,40,The Kampong,Cynderella43,"If this review was helpful, please click the HELPFUL button.  Thanks! :-D"
Natural paradise in an urban jungle,May 2016,40,The Kampong,adriansanmach,"The Kampong National Botanical Garden is a small garden in Coconut Grove, Miami. If do you have time to spare during you visit in Miami I suggest that you visit this charming property. The garden is beautiful and the upkeep is excellent. The entrance is only with appointment which make you feel practically alone in your visit."
Dr. Fairchild's personal home ,June 2016,50,The Kampong,DRGNO,"This is the second time I've visited here and it's absolutely incredible. The tropical vegetation and especially the tropical Fruits there is so luxurious, with incomparable blazes of colors and exotic fruits. The time spent on the tour will leave you breathless. Barbara our guide spouted with historical and current information about Dr. Fairchild and what he's done for American Horticulture, particularly in the tropical fruit areas. I was so impressed that I joined their organization and for a new member gift I chose an exotic Peanut Butter Nut Tree. This tree comes from S. American and has fruit the size of quail eggs and when ripe taste like peanut butter. I kid you not.  The little sprout is my tree and the large green bushy tree next to it is adult sized. "
Great concert venue,June 2014,40,Casino Miami,mwooduk,We do not gamble so I am reviewing this casino purely on the concert/entertainment venue portion.  We attended the Dennis De Young/Music of Styx concert on June 21st and had a good experience.  The location is not in the greatest part of town but still safe.  Parking was plentiful and there is also valet parking.  We had purchased tickets in a section that gave us better seating near the front and meet and greet options with Dennis and the band after the show.  The casino also offered free tickets/general admission for seats at the back but even they were great seats and I think we would happily sit back there too in the future.  We thought the sound was very good and the chairs were padded and comfortable.  Staff were excellent (especially Angel who was fabulous) and the security guards were very good with a few drunk people who got out of control and handled the situation well.  Drinks at the bar were affordable (although the wine was low quality) and they have hostesses who will take your drink order from your seats.  It reminded me of being on a cruise ship!  We did have to wait one hour after the show to meet Dennis which was quite a long time to wait since the concert ended at 11 p.m. but his show was so good and his voice so great still (at the age of 67) we were happy to wait to thank him for a great show.  We will definitely return to see America in November.
Excellent Concert - America!,November 2014,40,Casino Miami,mwooduk,"My husband and I came here on Saturday night to see the band America.  We had never seen them before.  We got a Groupon - 2 tickets for $18.50 - what a bargain!  When we arrived, parking was very busy one hour before the concert but we managed to find a space (valet always has too long of a line).  You have to take your Groupon paperwork to the Will Call area to swap it out for a ticket - then your ticket allows you to sit anywhere in a certain section.  The concert started about 10 minutes late.  The band was fantastic!  So glad we went.  A little tip for visitors - the bar/waitress service inside the concert venue charges far higher drink prices.  If you go out again by the entrance to the concert facility, you can get the same glass of wine for $2.50!  They also sell food just outside for less money.  The sound was really good and we had a wonderful evening."
Just OK,November 2014,30,Casino Miami,MrMiamiExplorer,"Casino Miami, formerly known as Miami Jai Alai has been around for decades. Since it expanded to become a casino, I haven't seen Jai Alai in session even once. I wonder if they discontinued it completely? You will get free play with a new player's club account. You may drive right by the entrance road to this casino as there is no noticeable signage and it is surrounded by warehouses, industrial factories, and low income crime ridden neighborhoods. The casino itself is probably the ugliest one in Miami and resembles a large warehouse from the exterior itself, with little concern for landscaping the exterior. Surprisingly it is always packed with gamblers despite the fact that the area is not known for people with income to burn. If it is pouring rain you will get soaked (unless you valet) as there is no covered garage parking, but rather 1 big open lot which floods up to your ankles. Due to the surroundings, there seems to always be at least one police car in the lot. Some of the security guards I have found to be aggressive and unprofessional. This casino is literally down the street from the airport, so anyone with a long layover can kill time and blow money there. Despite the flaws, we will keep returning."
"Crappy, but fun",February 2016,30,Casino Miami,Jim K,"Really loud, very energetic Latin music on a Saturday night. Super friendly staff, and even most of the patrons. No actual gaming tables except poker, but they give you $25 to drop into slots. Tip: you only keep your winnings, so cash out each time you win, even if it's just $.50. Otherwise you'll just lose it all. Jai alai is only weekend afternoons, but you can check out the empty arena off hours. (We were not there at the right time to see a match.)"
My favorite place in Miami,March 2017,50,The Kampong,etisarah,"A piece of eden in Miami, so quiet with a magnificent garden, the house is wonderful, as the view on the sea. The guide was really nice. The guided visit took us almost two hours and you are free to spend more time after the end of the tour."
OK Garden,April 2017,30,The Kampong,LovetoTravel30606,"If I had nothing else to do, I would visit here.  Nothing spectacular especially after having visited the Fairchild Gardens earlier in the day. You must book an appointment to visit which wasn't listed on the website so we left our phone information on their voice mail while standing at the gate entrance. We had to tell them the exact time we would arrive so someone could meet us. The young lady gave us a brief history and then sent us on a self guided tour.  Not sure why is has received such fabulous reviews."
Bus trip ,March 2017,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Vacation517,Stopped here on a bus trip to Key West. Not as smoky as I had read. Machines pay off. Lots of winners on our bus. Good buffet for only $10!
First Time Experience,March 2017,50,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Sherene B,This was a short stay but very mind relaxing and an enjoyable one...
"airboat trip was great, burglary from cars wasn`t.",March 2017,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Kadri V,"Thieves knew that we won´t return to our cars for some time (we took 30 min airboat ride), they took our drone and laptop - valuables that were too big to take with us.  We felt quite safe - everything including parking lot seemed to be well organized. We thought wrong. Hire somebody to keep visitors` cars safe, it`s  important for your business."
The big Weekend ,March 2017,50,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,RayJ383,We will definitely go back again. 
Miami's Own Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman,June 2014,50,The Kampong,kayakgirls33305,"The Kampong, oozing with Miami history, is a well kept secret.  Nestled along the beautiful waters of  Biscayne Bay, this property leads one out of the chaos of a fast-paced Miami lifestyle into the serenity of a magical garden. Complete with countless plant varieties(well labelled), uniquely designed buildings, and tales of South Florida pioneers (dating back to the 1800s), one can't help but be impressed with this little-known gem. Dr. David Fairchild, one of the more famous residents, contributed his horticultural knowledge to create this tropical paradise. Dr. Eleanor Simmons, an equally notable character, was Miami's first woman physician who often made trips by donkey to Miccosukee tribal lands to help ailing natives. There are so many  stories which could fill this review, but treat yourself instead, to a trip of your own and see what a special place this really is. Reservations are recommended (Groupons sometimes available). Walking is easy to moderate"
Visiting hours - does not make sense,August 2014,10,The Kampong,Jules777_11,"I've been in Miami for the past 15 years - have never been to this park because of inconvenient schedule. Why are they closed weekends?!!! Does not make any sense. Maybe more people would visit it if the thought about locals, who need to WORK DURING WEEKDAYS?"
Lovely serene garden with many varieties of plants,December 2014,40,The Kampong,Torte_Sue,"The garden includes mangroves, a number of variety of palms, an African tulip tree, fruit trees, baobab, banyan, and many more. Most are nicely tagged. We saw some water fowl as well.There is even a water distillation device that ALexander Graham Bell devised on a visit. Other visitors included Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. We enjoyed having the garden entirely to ourselves. I am sure we would have learned much more on the tour. We see there are a number of special events open to the public."
Closed - except for Wednesday and Saturday (by appointment),December 2014,30,The Kampong,MTmaven,We were excited about seeing these gardens and headed there one afternoon - google and tripadvisor both said they'd be open. We were so disappointed that they weren't. From the gates you could see how cool the place must be so go... Just call and schedule a visit! 
Great Experience for a Botanist,February 2015,50,The Kampong,ROBERTLOUISSTEVENSON,"So many cool specimens you rarely see in the US. Blown away with the ylang- ylang, Tiplaris, Spathodea, Adansonia! Work a trip for anyone in the industry; I would skip it if you are not. Beware of the spiders!"
It won't hurt to try (pun intended),October 2016,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Chasity W,"This is not Vegas or even Biloxi. But if you want to have a little fun and quite possibly make some money this is the place to come. They give you $30 your first time visiting which is pretty cool if you're not a gambler but have gamblers with you. The buffet isn't again, Vegas or Biloxi, however the seafood is definitely fresh! I loooove the oysters. The buffer itself was $21 but I like to think it's worth it and the main attraction because I am not a gambler. Gimme the oysters man!"
Nice casino on edge of Everglades ,March 2019,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Bigo1952,Seen this place on edge of the Everglades and decide to stop in.  It was fairly large and had a large staff that seemed to be very watchful. Found a few machines that where down but there are plenty to play. Had some nice non smoking areas but the smoking areas were not to bad. Machines were not paying much while we were there but had a lot of fun. 
Latin Concerts Series,July 2016,50,Casino Miami,Roberto V,"Saturday night entertainment at Club Rio is fantastic and very inexpensive. Two Saturday's per month Famous Latin Bands & Singers entertain for free. Rest of the Fridays and Saturdays very good and well known Bands from all types of music from Rock & Roll, Disco, Jazz and more Latin Salsa also all free of charge. Drinks are very inexpensive. Always have a great time there and will continue to attend on a weekly basis sometimes twice a week. And then you have the slots and other games available to gamble and if lucky go home with some extra money. During the Jaialai season you can enjoy the Jaialai during the week and watch and gamble on this wonderfully played game."
Waste of time,August 2016,10,Casino Miami,lawsonlink1962,"This is the worst casino !!!--- I have been to casinos from  Las Vegas  to Maine -- Maine has a better casino than Miami !!!! Outdated --Went to see Jai Alai and the games are only during the day 12- to 5 pm --- Of course , had to stay since we drove there -- Sitting at the slot machine a roach ran over my foot !!! Not impressed Atmosphere depressing ---"
Off the beaten path ,August 2016,40,Casino Miami,ExplorerNancy,We visited more out of curiosity than being a fan. We had never been to a Jai Alai game. The spectators were few.  We enjoyed watching the game regardless. We imagined what it must have been like in the top of the sports popularity. 
Would have liked to see them play,September 2016,40,Casino Miami,KarneBH,We really only went thinking we could see them play.  The casino isn't that exciting.  The tablet games are all electronic.  My husband played them for a little while and ended up breaking even.  The slots robbed me.  :)  The place was clean.  I guess they only play Jai Alai during certain hours on Friday afternoons.  We should have checked into it more before we went.  
Smoke City,January 2017,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Brunokap,"If you like smoking and smelling like a cig....cone here;if you don't want to smell like a cig, go to the other casinos in and around Miami.  Pass!"
Small and interesting ,January 2017,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Judith P,This Indian Village Museum is outside of Miami basically in the middle of nowhere. Our tour guide was a Hispanic woman who was married to one of the tribe members. The people who were showing how to make jewelry silversmithing and other demonstrations or a various other tribes not belonging to this particular group. They also had an alligator demonstration where this young man came out and worked with one of the alligators. Then he offered for everyone to hold or touch a baby alligator. They also had a museum building with history about the particular tribe. Overall the information was educational and interesting.
"Great buffet, but ....",January 2017,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Jim B,Who allows people to smoke inside anymore?
Canadians...stay away.,February 2017,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,majorpappy,"Pulled into the Casino tonight after a terrific tour through The Everglades. My wife and I went to register for The Players Club and we were turned away because we did not have our Passports. Showed the young lady our  US Identification NEXUS and our Ontario Driver's Licences, but  she did not offer any assistance. A brief call to her immediate Supervisor revealed they had never heard of NEXUS nor the US Government's Trusted Traveller Program.  Would have been OK to gamble but with the rudeness and the embarrassment we encountered we chose to walk away. Tally up for the evening: Their loss."
Very Smoky,February 2017,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,BeverlyS739,Was fun to play bingo. Slots are fun too. Cafeteria food is wonderful!!! Only trouble is that it's very smoky 
great place,August 2013,50,The Kampong,atraveler300,"not open to the puble often, but worth seeing when it is. Its like going back to a different time. Beautifull and different tress and plants. the guides are knowledgeable about the surroundings"
Hidden Treasure,August 2013,50,The Kampong,James L,"The Kampong is a estate that David Fairchild use to own and lived on the property.  The estate has over 100 exotic species of plants from all over the world.  The view with the biscayne bay in the background is very beautiful.  You will be amaze once you first step on the grounds.  The Kampong is a private estate found in Coconut Grove, and you need to make reservation before visiting.  The Kampong has a $35 entrance fee but it is well worth the admission if you really enjoy exotics plants.  Drive carefully on Douglas Road because you can easily miss the estate. Enjoy if you happen to visit this beautiful hidden treasure.  J"
A RELAXING HAVE RIGHT OFF THE MAIN DRAG,October 2013,50,The Kampong,evamaria13,"The former home of botanist and writer David Fairchild a fascinating place even if you're not all that interested in plants. You must sign up for a tour ($20 donation) and you'll be treated to a pleasant walk in the most beautiful gardens and lots of interesting information about local history. You'll tour Fairchild's laboratory and his original residence, which is filled with fabulous art he brought back from his wold-wide travels. Stay as long as you like after the tour. Walk down to the Bay to enjoy the view and the refreshing ocean breezes. Allow about two hours."
Great Garden to visit,October 2013,40,The Kampong,mwooduk,David Fairchild's home in Coconut Grove is well worth a visit.  We took advantage of a Living Social special two for one deal.  The tour was supposed to last one hour and after 1.5 hours we had only just entered the buildings on the property so my husband and I had to leave the tour and run down to the bay to see the view as we had to pick someone up at the airport.  We were sorry not to be able to stay and finish the tour of this very historical home.  The gardens and trees are quite lovely and the tour is worth doing.  You even get to sample Tamarind and other exotic fruits as you go round the garden.
Exquisite,December 2013,50,The Kampong,Aburel,"A lovely property which makes you to discover the Coral Gables neighborhood. Call in advance because they have a lot of activities there which can make your visit imposible. Great tours to understand the concept and the founder. The garden and the house are adorable. An old garden with lots of mature, beautiful trees and not only. Don't miss the house and the view of Miami from the property shore."
Amazing way to see the Everglades for Free,April 2018,50,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",ustelephone,"Allow a couple of hours for your drive, and expect some rough road on the Western end. Bring bug spray and use common sense with respect to wildlife."
"Nothing to see, long way to drive",May 2018,10,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",RoyalSilk,"We drove all the way out to the loop road - 53 miles and over an hour - but all it is is....a road.   While there was vegetation on both sides we saw no wildlife.  The nearest we got was a sign which said look out for panthers.  A total waste of half a day, not to mention the gas."
Gorgeous loop drive,August 2018,50,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",HarmonyW22,"This is a 24-mile (or so) drive through some great scenery in the National Preserve.  It's mostly a gravel road, but as long as you're ok with that, there are some terrific things to see.  We were mostly looking at the mangrove swamp, but there was some wildlife, mostly alligators, flamingos, and herons.  Lots of places to pull over to the side to get pictures. "
Pool and exercise equipment,April 2014,30,A. D. Barnes Park,AkGirl1987,"Not many good paths for running, but good exercise equipment. They also have a nice pool complex but I have not used this feature. There is also access to the canals if you want to canoe or kayak. "
Great park for all kind of activities ,April 2014,50,A. D. Barnes Park,SandroG51971,"In the past i visited this park for parties and picnics.  This time we went to ride bicycle and walk inside the trail which was very interesting, inside the trail you have a little feeling of being in a rainforest.  You can hear birds see some of them, and of course squirrels roaming around.  In the middle of the trail there are some pavilions that looks like in summer kids stay and camp.  I noticed canoes, not sure ifntjey are fornrent or for the kids for the summer camp.  Also there is a pool, a river, a big land to bring your kite and tables for picnics.  Enjoy this park."
brief visit,June 2016,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,nancy34110,"We stopped here for a quick visit on our way home to Naples from the Keys.  We started with lunch at the deli.  They offered very generous sandwiches, easily shared,  at a reasonable price.  After lunch we looked to gamble for a bit.  As we walked around looking for our favorite, video poker machines, we discovered that that have NO video poker.  So we looked for something else and found a lot of weird games that I haven't seen before.  We ended up at 2 very hungry penny machines, then went home.  Too bad, they could do better with the machines so we'd be willing to stay longer."
Needs a facelift!,July 2016,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Donna C,"You can smell the smoke before you even walk in the doors. Walk in and it's like you entered a time zone. The place is old, run down and dirty. Neon lighting at the bar that's probably been there since the 70's. The floor in the lounge was sticky....not just in one spot but everywhere. The bathroom was the dirtiest I've ever been in....the smell was unbearable. Walked by a service area that was filthy. Crumbs, food and garbage all over the floor. I didn't dare eat anything. They give you $30 in free play when you sign up for a card. We actually won and played all day on their 30 dollars. There are 2 rooms that are smoke free. Decent variety of games in the smoke free rooms. There are many choices in casinos and this was just doesn't stand up to the others.  Although the slots seem a bit looser than other casinos in the area, I don't think we will be back. This casino needs a major facelift and a much better ventilation system."
Worst Casino Experience Ever,July 2016,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,jfebles1984,"We was here last Friday night, this casino need a update of their installation ASAP as well of the staff, the servers are the worst, horrible customer service, I ask to a lady for a drinks (I remember his name was Dayana), she take like 20 min to brings ours drinks and one of them came wrong.... thats means another 20 min waiting for our drinks. After that I think she was mad of us for not accept the wrong cocktails and spill part of the drink on my wife dress (horrible). The casino smell like a big tabaco box, old carpet, no direction, etc"
"Big unimpressive casino, needs more pazazz",September 2016,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,mrichardm2016,"On a Motorcycle ride from Naples and stopped here to see the casino.  Initially they m,ake you park way off the easy access when there are 1000s of places near the entrance.  There is an air of tension all around and not really friendly.  The only saving grace was the buffet that was reasonable and good."
breakfast,October 2016,50,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Jaimary194,"very nice a lot to choose, and the price is excellent , service was real nice, and friendly, nice orange juice"
Great for family,April 2016,30,A. D. Barnes Park,lalocadr19,"Great park!! Had a walking trail,play ground area for the kids, barbeque area, table for family picnic. some area surrounded by trees which make you feel like you not even in the city. Park has a fishing area."
beautiful and relaxing history lesson,October 2012,50,The Kampong,DebbieNiskin,"If you have a free morning in South Florida, one of the places you might choose is The Kampong in Coconut Grove. David Fairchild's private home is now a truly serene and beautiful venue for seeing tropical plants and trees. A tour of the Kampong introduces you to the horticulture and the life style of that famous man, his wife and Alexander Graham Bell, his father-in-law. The guides are volunteers and have stories to tell along with botanical information."
"Quiet, relaxing day exploring nature!",October 2012,40,The Kampong,bichromatic,"A great way to spend a nice, quiet and relaxing day exploring nature! However, if you are a plant expert and looking to gain lots of knowledge and insight, this is probably not be the place for you. If you want to see a few plants/trees/fruits and learn a little bit about Miami's history, then this is a nice little adventure to embark on. Remember to bring water and dress comfortably!"
Great for a short visit,September 2012,40,The Kampong,Cricket A,You may want to stop by if you're in the area.  It really is not a big property and it won't take more than one hour's visit to see it all.  You may be tempted to linger because it is interesting and beautiful. An oasis off the very beaten path.
A morning stroll,March 2013,50,The Kampong,Nuvia1,"The private estate home of David Fairchild is off the beaten path in Coconut Grove. My husband, sister and I thoroughly enjoyed the tour of the garden, tropical plants, flowering trees, fruit trees and exotic transplants from around the world thanks to the worldwide travels of David Fairchild. Location, location, location....right on Biscayne Bay...a site to behold in itself. If you're into nature and history, this is the place to explore. No gift shop just beauty and imagination. A simple estate with no real bells and whistles.  Just calm serenity among lovely trees to behold."
Quietly refreshing low key excellence in nature and habitat history,April 2013,50,The Kampong,tico c,"This is a superb, quiet, peaceful treasure where regular glitzy tourists don't go because they don't know or probably care about educational oasi like Fairchild Gardens, Viscaya, and similar venues!  This is quietly and easily accesible in Coconut Grove at the residence of the early Flrida icon, David Fairchild and wife.   The history is delicious, as are their museumly preserved furnishings and structures.

BEAUTIFUL PARK NAMES AFTER THE ORIGINAL SETTLERS OF COCONUT GROVE !!!,June 2016,40,Peacock Park,Frank d,This park is named after the Peacock family who came to this area in the 1880's to build a hotel and establish the first hotel in mainland Florida South of Palm Beach. Many of the hotel visitors lingered in the area thus giving beginning to the founding of Coconut Grove. I remember this park to be a Hippie Hang out back in the 1960's where some famous concerts were held.
Just a park ,June 2016,30,Peacock Park,wolf3728,The park is just a standard park. They do have a nice place for children. Large green areas for sports. 
Small Park with water view,December 2015,50,Peacock Park,thej0nes3,"This is a small park with just blocks away from Coconut Groove. Peacok Park also has some small art architecture surrounding the edges of the park, it also has a small trail with views of water."
great for kids!!,December 2016,40,Peacock Park,lalocadr19,"Great time for kids has two playground for older kids and one for toddler. Has tennis court, and plenty of space for them to run. No fee for the park."
Small museum,November 2014,30,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,ela8457,"There were not many exhibits and you can't get close to the planes. My husband really is a fan of planes, so it was a nice break to go there. The quality of the tshirts and the cap we bought were really good."
"Very Clean, Rooms are very Comfortable",March 2016,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Ray G,"Staff was great, Rooms were clean and comfortable, Buffets were great and reasonably priced and plentiful.They have 3 Bars and 1 is open 24 hours. Didn't try the restaurants.But their cafe is open 24 hours and the food is pretty good and not expensive. The only drawback is the Casino has no Black Jack either Virtual or Real , same for Roulette and Craps. They really need this here for the Casino."
Not a bad place,February 2016,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,flboy1966,We stayed here the night before our cruise out of Miami. The staff wasn't very friendly at the Front Desk. The rooms where clean and comfortable. The casino was smoke filled but that's to be expected. The shuttle to the cruise port was free and convenient. The breakfast buffet was good with a lot of options.
Lunch Buffet,March 2016,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Miguel M,"very good lunch buffet ,meat,fish,chicken,pasta,desert's,all included buffet ,price is cheap and you will enjoy the food."
Thumbs down,April 2016,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,William J,The hotel was nice but I went to play poker. No one spoke English people were eating at the tables people were reading text messages at the table. I have never been to a casino where the customers ran the casino. The people in charge do not know how to run a casino and the place is  making money anyway. The place has potential to make so much more. The casino needs someone to run it that gives a Damm!
casino,March 2016,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Paul B,I live in key west and this is the closest casino with a hotel. this casino is ok at best. the last time I was there I cant believe they started charging for drinks including coffee and they also say they have wifi but they don't tell you they charge the hell out of you for it.  the rooms are ok but nothing special. the buffets are not that good either every thing is cold. the restaurant on the second floor is the only thing that I can rave about.they now are charging to park also.also most people that go here  don't speak English so its hard to communicate.
Picturesque  garden,May 2011,50,The Kampong,Kelly_TPM,http://ntbg.org/gardens/kampong.php
Go because it is beautiful; Go because it is historic,May 2011,40,The Kampong,kdmia,"I can honestly say that, although I have lived here for ages, I had never heard of the Kampong and, as I asked my friends and family, they hadn't either. What a beautiful surprise to go visit this Botanical Garden and understand that David Fairchild, the man who traveled the world to bring us plants and fruits that we would have never experienced in the U.S., lived and worked here. Make sure to walk down to the bay and see the view he enjoyed while living here and while planning his many travels for the U.S. dept. of Agriculture. Make reservations and then go enjoy the scenery and the quiet in the midst of the bustling city, and know that you are also supporting local and national history at the same time. It is most enjoyable when visiting it from Oct/Nov through May, because of the heat; although, of course, there are things blooming and growing all year and it is always a quiet respite..."
"A nice, quite compact place to visit",January 2012,40,The Kampong,KENTGA,"We passed on Fairchild gardens so I can't compare the two. This place is relatively small and is beautifully landscaped and the staff is helpful. You must make an appointment to visit. We did the self guided tour but they have guided tours at 10:30 on Wed and Sat. The ""office"" is the house that Fairchild lived in. Most of the gardens are trees and shrubs (not flowers) but their is a lily pond with lilies and lotus flowers in it. There are lots of tropical plants from all over the world."
Put this gem of a place on your agenda,March 2012,50,The Kampong,bluenote18,"It is not as easily accessible as most attractions.  Kampong is also a research center so a visit requires a bit of planning.  It is open Tues-Fri from 10-12 by appointment only. They offer two-hour guided tours on selected Wednesdays and Saturdays at 10:30 and reservations are recommended, although four of us just were able to walk in one Wednesday and join the scheduled tour.   The tours are given by volunteers who are enthusiastic and passionate about Kampong.  The more important thing, however, is less what they have to say than that they enable you to visit and enjoy this beautiful place."
Fun and Educational !!! Excellent!,January 2015,50,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,vija0929,"Wings Over Miami Air Museum is a treasure destination for families who search for fun ways to educate their children (and adults!) while having an awesome on hand experience with the past. The planes exhibited are absolutely amazing and very well kept. The stories surrounded the whole place are an open history book in which you walk right in. As a homeschool mom, I highly recommend this place. It is definitely fun and highly educational. This fantastic experience was made so worth it by Mr. Henry Adams and Ms. Suzette Rice. They were exceptionally kind and helpful. Do visit Wings Over Miami. You will love it!"
Great local Museum,August 2015,40,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,Charles G,I really enjoyed their small but diverse selection of aircraft especially the seaplane. This attraction has very few aircraft on display and you cannot touch them nor get very close to them. But I am happy to say that I stopped in.
Very Nice display,January 2016,40,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,pattycakesmn,"I was really happy with the display.  Stopped by on a rainy day, decent number of planes- but the best part was an owner was there and gladly let me tour things up close.  It was a highlight of my year to actually touch a plane that was so meticulously rebuilt!  I'd never would've guessed I'd be able to do that."
Maybe was.... but today NOT,April 2016,10,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,Taxxxman,"few dirty and fakes aircrafts... a lot of spiders homes, nothing to do, nothing to watch. For me this place was like a scam with glorious name. so bad. Never again"
Awesome food and drinks plus great vendors!,September 2018,50,The Wynwood Marketplace,Michelle P,I've visited this venue many times for the past couple years and it's always a new experience! They are always hosting awesome events from concerts to 3-day festivals. They also have a great variety of food trucks and arts & crafts vendors on a regular basis. Definitely one of my favorite places in Wynwood!
Kampong,August 2017,50,The Kampong,Popgrowl,"Usually access to these grounds are through attending an event, so... find an event!  "
A bit of mystique ,August 2017,40,The Kampong,RosieSpoonbill,We visited on a weekday during off season and had the place to ourselves. We enjoyed our visit and will recommend to family and friends. 
Every this was new and bright,November 2015,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,prape,"The casino had only been open a few weeks when we visited.  We drove the long curvey road through Helen because it was fall and we wanted to see the trees.  It was easy to find and park.  The machines all look new, but they have many of my old favorites.  I won on the 100 lions slot, had almost a full screen.  The line to the Awards window was very long, probably because it had not been open long.  We used our Rewards card and did not have to stand in line.  It seems small when compared to Cherokee, but I liked the food court more."
"Mediocre Casino and unpleasant Hotel,",December 2015,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,chemiami,"The Miccosukee Resort and Casino is located on the border of Miami-Dade County (City of Miami) so you are looking for a happening place in Miami you are actually pretty far from the Miami nightlife and happenings. It is located basically on the border between the Miccosukee Reservation and the City. Really the only reason to go to this hotel is if you are interested in visiting the Everglades and going hunting or doing eco-tourism; or if you like to gamble. It is not a full casino by the way, it only has poker, bingo, and slot machines. The Hotel is okay as hotels go but the ambiance is a little depressing. Restaurants are nothing great and you have to eat in the gaming floor for the most part which is busy and smokey. There are non-smoking floors but that is not where most of the restaurants are."
Mediocre Buffet,December 2015,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,kythoro,"Most casinos have outstanding food at fairly reasonable prices, however the upstairs buffet was mediocre at best. The buffet is laid out well with a large selection of food, however food was very bland. Cookies were hard and a little stale. I sampled most of the entrees but nothing was satisfying. Prices were very reasonable and this food may be appealing to another. Buffet was smoke free, whereas casino area allowed smoking and you could smell the smoke but it was not overwhelming. We donated a few $$ to the slots!"
Donation to the slot gods..,December 2015,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,CarolinaCoopers,I want to add that being an ex-smoker and walking into the casino I now realize how non smokers feel about the smell of smoke...I'm not gonna whine about it though because this is America and those that wanna smoke have the right.
Hard to come up with positives ,January 2016,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,ClassGlassPhoto,"Stopped by this casino since it was pretty much the only one in the area, have to agree with most of the reviews - pretty much one giant smoky building filled with slot machines and nobody appearing to win anything.  You will smell like an ashtray if you spend more than 2 minutes in here!  There is bingo and poker but it's pretty much a big slot hall.  With all the incredible wildlife in the area and Miami nearby, we won't be back if we're in the area"
Beautiful garden,November 2016,50,The Kampong,rmathijssen,It's a beautiful garden and definately worth a visit when you are nearby. Many different type of flowers and trees in a great environment. And don't forget the great view of the Biscaine Bay!
Christmas in Miami,December 2017,50,The Kampong,rep888,"A treat, set aside a couple of hours and get a real appreciation of how Miami came together. The horticulture is the draw but the story is great too. Very accessible even though it may feel as if it’s not— you have to reserve for your visit— but then you’ll feel as if the place is all yours and the staff are friendly and welcoming.  "
A Gem,January 2018,50,The Kampong,InTheGrove214,"If you want a sense of what Miami was like before high rises and McMansions, come to  the Kampong. This tropical garden gem was the home of botanist extraordinaire David Fairchild (son-in-law of Alexander Graham Bell) who then sold it to another family passionate about plants.  The Kampong took a major hit during Hurricane Irma in September 2017, but they are getting back on their feet.  Guided tours are offered on Thursdays and Saturdays, which are worth it since there are so many exotic species that happen to thrive in Miami's subtropical climate.  "
Unique Little Place Rich in History,June 2017,40,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,runaway2travel,The first stop on my Little Havana Food Tour. This place is a unique little art gallery with food. They have a lot of different things to try and the art and backstory to the owner was interesting to say the least.
"Hit the spot with tapas, wine, art, and music.",July 2017,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,622elianap,"It is small and cozy, but with plenty of seating for about 40.  I went with a group of friends all couples except for me and did not feel weird at all.  There were other tables of girlfriends and a few savvy tourists.  Everyone had a great time.  The tapas are delicious and so are the wines offered.  The ambiance and music fantastic and the owners are constantly coming to the tables and attentive to the comfort and enjoyment of their guests.  Would definitely recommend."
"Wonderful spot, wonderful owners ",July 2017,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,evagross81,What a special spot. The owners Agustin and Ester are lovely and gentle people. Beautiful art and the best mojito in town! Be sure to stop here to see this beautiful authentic spot. 
Drinks Food & Art,December 2017,40,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,Thomas V,"Unique spot with good art exhibits, plus some food and drink.  Lots of the local culture of Little Havana.  Some good art."
I need to win the Lottery,November 2015,50,Peter Tunney Experience,sccrref,"So I can buy one of his pieces. Amazing art. I had heard of him but never seen his work close up. A must see if an art lover. Doesnt take too long to see all the work and many other neat things to see, do and eat nearby"
Highly recommended ,December 2015,50,Peter Tunney Experience,tommyboy30,"This is a great location and area to visit when in Miami. The graffiti around every building, the atmosphere, cafes, galleries are amazing and should be on everyone's to do list. "
Wonderful,March 2016,40,Peter Tunney Experience,Luvs2TravelAnywhere,The Peter Tunney Experience is inside the courtyard of the  Wynwood Walk and is delightful - it is a must if you are in the sort district.
Not worth it! What a waste!,December 2015,10,Pinto's Farm,Jaime H,"I just wanted to share our experience of Pinto's Farm with you all. It keeps coming up in my news feed on Facebook and their website & videos make it look so cute, so I convinced my family it was soming we jud HAD to do over Christmas. Don't be fooled! This place is not worth the drive! We live in east Fort Lauderdale & bought the $10 discounted tickets and even for that it wasn't worth going. It is like going to play in a red neck's backyard for the day. There are some old rusted bikes to race around an overgrown badly in need of a weeding track. 2 cute, but sad looking ponies that get walked around a dirt only circle over & over again. A petting zoo, but you can actually only go in to feed the 3 goats. The other animals are in wire fenced enclosures that are off limits. All the enclosures only have dirt ground, though the chicken coop obviously has chicken coops also. The hayride is one of those no hay type hayrides south Florida seems to be known for & takes you around a boring & over grown section of their ""backyard"". There is nothing fun or interesting to see or do for the few minutes you are on this. There are paddle boats that go around an island, which I will admit was fun, but one time around & I was over it. Oh, & they have 2 old worn out bounce houses in the front area near a dirt hill that kids run around in & then go into the bounce houce with dirt all over them. Maybe this is your kind of fun, but it sure isn't mine! We will not be returning!"
Good time--we had fun!,February 2015,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,RollTide315,You can check-out their website for more information on facilities and events they host -- in much better detail than I can provide (http://www.miccosukee.com/resort/).  Cheers!
Good experience. Kids loved their playground ,August 2015,50,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,TheArmasFamily,"We visited back on 2003 but came back this summer with our parents so they can experience a casino for the first time. They have child care service for $10 2 hours and the kids loved. They have one of those multiple stories playgrounds maze and they had a blast. They didn't want to leave. They offer you $30 if it's your first time to play all in one easy machine. My mom won $120 out of those free $30. My husband won too but he spent it all afterwards but I least I didn't feel like I lost our money. Is a smokers paradise, I didn't like it because I don't smoke but they have an in close non smoking area that is great. You get free drinks while you are playing. They are free so don't expect great quality and it takes a while to get them. We went to the 2 ND floor afterwards for the buffet and it was good. Not a humongous selection buy food was eat able and international so everyone enjoy it. "
Go somewhere else,August 2015,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Mike B,"This place has slots, that is the pro. As for the cons, you will experience why Miami is considered the rudest city on the planet. This place is filled with third world trash who don't speak a word of English, and who are blatantly rude. Had some guy sit next to me and started hitting the buttons on my machine. Had to get someone to get him away from me because he started following me around. He couldn't understand what he was doing wrong. That is the mentality there... As for the slots, they advertise the highest payouts and most paid out jackpots in South Florida. Lies. Miccosukee is the only casino where I never left ahead, also never saw anyone win a hand pay. Most visits, slots are dead cold. When they are paying which is rare, you will stay afloat, but lose. Lastly, stay away from their 2 cent quick hit machines, they are rigged to not pay anything."
Positives and Negatives,August 2015,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,MrMiamiExplorer,"I had not visited this casino in a long time, so we made a detour on the way home from Everglades Safari Park. First the positives: As it was a weekday afternoon, parking was not a problem. As I had not signed up for a Player's Club Card in the past, I decided to get one. It came with $30.00 of free play, which is nice considering some local casinos don't give any. Though I didn't win big, I still walked away with $23.00 of free cash in my pocket I won with the original $30.00 credit. This more than paid for our gas to trek up to the Glades. Now for the negatives: the road construction on the Tamiami Trail to get to the casino was a pain. If you listen in the parking lot, you can hear firing from the gun range across the street, which makes me concerned about stray bullets. The slot machines are not Vegas style, but are rather computer arcade screens which simulate the real thing, and are much easier to program not to pay out. As always, the casino is filled with foul cigarette smoke which saturates our clothes and hair. Rather than circulating around the casino like most places, security guards are just posted to stand all over the exterior of the casino gaming floor. Strangely many of the security guards are Hispanic senior citizens with not a single Native American to be found. The tall sign on the Tamiami trail, which can be seen for miles still advertises the $9.95 steak and lobster, but I can tell you from unfortunate experience that the steak and lobster are both so small, they are practically appetizers. After walking all over the casino floor looking for a restroom we finally found what appeared to be the only one, which was closed for construction. We smelled urine in the parking lot earlier which was now obvious. Even the Players Club counter was closed with a sign directing us to a temporary table in the hotel lobby where a rude and unfriendly woman was handling it. The casino is surrounded by the picturesque natural beauty of Everglades Sawgrass habitats, but sadly not for long. The West side of the property was filled with trucks and bulldozers that already had begun digging up and destroying the surrounding natural habitats, possibly to mine for limestone rock. It's a shame that the Miccosukees apparently now care more about money & profits than the environment their ancestors called home."
Too many people and way too may smokers,September 2015,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,mamicaliente2010,"the camping facility is too busy no machine to play, too many people smoking. It just just gross, the bathrooms are disgusting, not clean at all.  It is just gross!"
It was cool for easter,March 2016,30,Pinto's Farm,251jab,The park was small but the kids had a great time playing.  It is NOT a big place and you will be done within 2 hours.  The pony rides and the paddle boats were a nice treat.  
Disappointed,May 2016,20,Pinto's Farm,Holhaag,"It's a nice location, however, it's pretty run down.  Kids don't really notice things so they will have fun.  However, the hay ride?? you go along a dirt road and see plants and the black plastic planters all piled up around everywhere. Not only nothing to see but the driver acted like he really hated his job.   The petting zoo is really bad, animals in small spaces, at least the lady working at this spot was nice. It's a long drive from Miami to because basically there isn't much and you can do it all in an hour MAX."
Hermoso Lugar ,October 2016,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,Le0414,"I loved this place. Great atmosphere and worth the visit. I tried a mojito and mariquitas. The art was beautiful, too. "
"Talented artist, great atmosphere, great Cuban coffee",October 2016,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,ksa0409,"Stumbled upon this little gallery and after browsing his gorgeous inventive and colorful artwork, he came out to introduce himself.  They have a nice little bar with great coffee and what looks like a good wine menu as well.  Very clean, classy, quaint and welcoming.  Check it out!  "
A Must Visit in Miami!,November 2016,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,jcmota,The chef is excellent you can try any dish. If you visit 8th st you should stop there.
Very authentic restaurant in Little Havana!,November 2016,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,Dobkusz,"I live in Miami and now it is my place in Little Havana! A Cuban artist hosts guests in his gallery, shakes hands with everybody, serves great food and Mojito! If you are visiting 8th street, don't go home without stopping by! Rare treasure in Miami."
Great Hospitality and great art,December 2016,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,jtbrightm,"We started the Miami culinary tour at this art store and taverna.  Agustin, the artist, presides over the food and refreshment, but it is the art he produces that should be the draw.  As we waited for the tour to start, my wife carefully inspected his art work.  After the tour we came back to his taverna to pick out a few pieces to take home.  His work was so cool and so diverse.  And, as we looked and bought he couldn't have been more welcoming and attentive and friendly.  If you are looking, or even if you aren't, for really unique Cuban art, this is the place to go.  If you are in Little Havana or nearby, please go and check out some really unique art work."
Best School Field Trip,February 2016,50,Pinto's Farm,margie0680,"My child and I had the opportunity to visit the farm during a school field trip. So far it's been the best field trip experience we've had. They had numerous educational activities to do. Such as the sink or float lab, fish and turtle lecture with feeding, petting zoo talks with the keeper, pony rides. After we completed our scheduled activities the kids had time to play on true pedal race karts. Totally recommend this farm for families with young children."
jai alai,March 2017,30,Casino Miami,Nicola B,The casino was clean and not busy and in need of a face lift. However we came to see the live jai alai games.  This is a sport that we had not seen before and it was actually quite exciting to watch.  However the stadium seating area was very old outdated and filthy.  I am sure that in it's prime this sport was well attended.
Not worth the stop,May 2017,20,Casino Miami,RichardHFLA,"Was told when I called there was a 'restaurant' on site, not true, just a small grill with burgers and such but the service was friendly."
So much fun in a hop skip & jump from airport and hotels,July 2017,50,Casino Miami,Amilia A,We had a girls weekend & just went for a few hours & we enjoyed ourselves so much..a must stop if you can
Ok place,December 2017,40,Casino Miami,Radiomike33,If you have nothing better to do than come here
Great management!,April 2015,50,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,kevin w,The hotel manager Roudy was extremely helpful with what I needed. Looking forward to coming back!! It makes your stay better when the management actually cares about your needs
"GOOD BED, A BIT DISTANT FROM THE AIRPORT",April 2015,30,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,sunnycastillo,"The room was good, the bed was very comfortable.  It did not smell like smoke in the room, even though it is a casino hotel.  I got checked in fast, the staff in the lobby was nice and helpful.  It is about 14 miles away from the airport, since it is in the everglades area... so not the best hotel for easy access to airport, but this is the hotel where we were booked after a horrible experience of flight cancellations at the Miami Airport.  It is nice that there was a deli available to purchase food or to get room service, pretty much 24/7.  if you book at a casino hotel, don't expect quite lobbies and serene casino area.  Duh.  :)  I will mark this hotel at 3 stars, wondering if my judgment is marred by the late night check-in and early morning check out... but i got a good sleep!"
Horrible service and food,April 2015,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Shambrock,Came for the night to gamble and watch Merriweather fight. No servers in the bars. You had to go outside the bar to get a drink.  The room looks nice but bed is really soft. . Tried to get money on platinum max and front desk wouldn't do it. Smallest buffet ever. Not like other casinos. Food was horrible and tasteless. Don't waste your time and money.  Drinks are served in 6 oz cups and expensive. 
Good place for truckers to kill sometime,May 2015,40,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Shannon C,My husband and I got a load to miami which isnt trucker friendly when it comes to parking. The casino has plenty of rig parking. The Buffet was small but good the smoked pork roast was delicious the crab legs were cold so a little hard to break. Everyone was polite and courteous. They gave us 30.00 for registering to play with i lost mine and hubby doubled his. It was a great way to kill some time. The smoke was pretty thick is the only drawback we had but that being said my husband is allergic to it and still tolerated it ok. We will go back again.
Great Time,May 2015,50,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Ashley C,"Everything was just simply perfect when we arrived, only issue we had was the rooms not be in ready in time but other then that I enjoyed it and so did my kids."
So cool day or night!,May 2019,50,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",414janalh,We went during mating season and it was very windy so the alligators weren’t really out a whole lot during the day. We didn’t see any in our airboat tours and heard this place was a must. We went at dusk/night the first time and brought flash lights. We stopped at all the water ways and could see eyes glowing back at us! A few even swam towards us. It was pretty cool to see. Others were right there at the waters edge. It was a rush! Stay in the car if you go at night because it’s dark and you have zero cell phone service if something happens. It was so cool we went back the next day and it did not disappoint!
Nature untouched,October 2019,50,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",skyde_k,I’ll go back for sure. 
One of our favorite drives,December 2019,50,"Loop Road, Big Cypress National Preserve",Shellqueen2014,"Where can you drive at country road in Florida?  We discover Loop road about 8 years ago and it is an off the beaten path gravel road through the Everglades swamp.  Always an exciting adventure as you never know what will surprise you in this off road experience. Birds of all kinds. You must work to see them at times. Must drive slowly with The eyes of a hawk. Alligators, turtles snakes .lLoops off 41 between Naples and Miami and return you to 41 by way of Native American settlement. "
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH,August 2019,20,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,lamujer21,"This casino has changed a lot. The smaller jackpots are being raised to attract people to think that they might win, People put $$$$$ in machines and you can consider yourself lucky if you win 100.00 this after you put in 300.00. This is ridiculous. I strongly suggest that this casino starts handing out more $$$ to their players. It is my humble opinion that these machines are FIXED. Fix all of their broken machines. Have more cash out personnel on the floors and motivate players ( by seeing some wins ) with smaller jackpots."
UNLESS YOU WANT SECOND HAND SMOKE DONT GO,June 2019,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,Monica Z,we left faster than we arrived 
THIS CASINO IS A SCAM,November 2019,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,FAIVER A,"The casino has become a scam, the machines are extremely controlled so as not to pay a penny, for a long time I have visited the casino weekly but it is already impossible to win, all visitors agree on the same thing as a scam and not to mention the bad conditions of the hotel that looks like garbage because of the dirty and stinky"
Dr. Davis,December 2019,10,Casino at Miccosukee Resort & Gaming,freem99,"Don’t waste your money. The machines may give you small wins but overall you will end up loosing money in you stay longer. I won $400 but ended up putting it back to machine! Usually you can win more but I played several machines and they are tide! But, I broke even, on this ordeal. Luckily I didn’t lose anything just time. People are playing hard there and lots of money is left behind. You don’t hear jackpots or nothing! Go anywhere but there.  If you do, you will regret wasting time and money!"

Sunday Brunch,February 2019,40,Peacock Park,nibaldom2015,"Decided to have Brunch near by and afterwards came to the park here. The trees and open space is beautiful, there are plenty of areas with shade if you want to picnic.Towards the end of the park headed towards the water there are great views of Biscayne Bay. There are swings for the kids, and very family area, great for a weekend afternoon. Enjoy"
 It much to it ,April 2019,30,Peacock Park,StephenCr0ss,To be honest it was a bit disappointing and not much on offer.  We did not stay long as nothing really there. There are nicer parks around.
Great spot to bring the kids for lunch and play!,July 2019,50,Peacock Park,amyweisshomes,This park is a gem! It is very well maintained and offers an area for kids to play while adults eat at the the restaurant on park grounds.  There are bathroom facilities big enough for strollers and ample parking options nearby (download the parking app for convenient payment!).  I am a real estate agent in the area and this park is a big reason why families move to the neighborhood!
UNFORGETABLE,August 2018,50,A. D.

Family picnic,March 2019,50,A. D.

Lovely green space in the midst of Bird Road chaos!,June 2019,40,A. D. Barnes Park,mwooduk,Came by here to have a quiet lunch i the park -  lots of trees and picnic areas.

Wonderful place,April 2018,50,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,Cuido87,It's really special museum because it's run by private people and has a private collection. In addition all the planes there are flyable. Due to those reasons the collection is always changing. I feel sorry that non enthusiastic visitors may find it poor when it really is an very exciting and special place. Will definetly recomend to visit them.
Small museum but packs a punch,July 2018,50,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,ChristywithaY,"My husband and I have been to a couple air museums. This one is small in comparison but there's a lot of history literature and model airplanes and artifacts that we've never seen before at other museums. They had a hot air balloon basket, a replica of the Demoiselle, an F-14 Tomcat. One of the co-founders of the museum happened to be there and stopped and talked with us and allowed us up on his plane's cockpit and take pictures. It's details like that that made this museum different than the rest. "
Very Nice Air Museum,January 2019,50,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,Carlos B,"The flyer says: ""Wings Over Miami is a unique aviation museum established to honor commercial, military and general aviation history."" The key word is ""unique."" Let me explain why I think this is a very appropriate description. It consists of two parts: a model airplane section containing perhaps 2 or 300 scaled plane models all fully identified with manufacturer and model numbers and properly painted  with country insignias when applicable. They ar mostly displayed in glass cases by type of plane or by country. You should spend some time there before moving on to the second section, a large hanger with a dozen planes. Most planes on display are not only functional, they are are used in air shows and movies around the country. The museum is all indoors so it is great for a rainy day. Allow 1 to 2 hours to view the museum. If you have a group. I highly recommend you request a tour guide in advance. Our tour guide was absolutely wonderful."
Enjoyable museum for anyone interested in aviation,February 2019,40,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,Ian C,A small but fascinating museum - it would be even better to visit on one of their special events.
Interesting little Air Museum,May 2019,30,Wings Over Miami Air Museum,Bryan K,"There were two little photo ops for kids near the door to the main room.  Otherwise, it might not be so interesting for the little ones."
Two floors of contemporary art,March 2019,50,Rubell Family Collection,Ian C,A fascinating collection to visit for anyone interested in contemporary art. 
Fantastic gallery ,March 2019,50,Rubell Family Collection,yvesvd,Loved the ambiance in the gallery - 2 Floors with a lot of diversity. Walking around was inspiring and energising ! Staff very helpful 
Fantastic collection,February 2019,50,Rubell Family Collection,CSSnowshoer,"Room after room of great contemporary art. Seeing the Purvis Young..entire first floor, was a once in a lifetime experience. Got there easily by bus. "
very nice art collection,June 2019,50,Rubell Family Collection,UriE28,another contemporary art collection. Unique interesting and worth seeing the gallery
Rubell Museum,December 2019,50,Rubell Family Collection,BigoBoca,Incredible collection of amazing art. It’s now a museum that should not be missed. It’s a true destination museum.
Places to emjoy,May 2019,40,The Wynwood Marketplace,heda68,The market is located  in the heart of Wynwood few blocks from Wynwood walls. It combines Mexican + Cuban + latin American food music. The ambiance amazing watch  out with the prices and offers can be tricky 
Loved it!,May 2019,50,The Wynwood Marketplace,Kira F,"This place is a must see! Shopping, Music, Drinks! What more could you want! If you are coming to Wynwood you must stop by!"
Great time!,May 2019,50,The Wynwood Marketplace,Joanna M,"We came here for a night out in Miami as part of a bachelorette weekend. We loved the entire vibe of this place. The music was great (mix of Spanish and top 40, some older songs as well). We had a great time dancing the night away. The service at the bars was great. The look of the place was very cute- string lights hanging, fake grass as flooring in some spots. By far a bonus is that there are a whole bunch of food trucks located in the back. Definitely try the taco food truck- 1 taco was 2.99, but they were by far the best tacos we've ever had (try the chicken ones!!). Definitely a variety of food to choose from to end a great night of dancing."
"Cool area, good food",September 2019,40,The Wynwood Marketplace,Eric S,"In the heart of Wynwood.  This is a cool area.  Marketplace has good food, good service.  Definitely enjoyed our night out here!"
The Wynwood marketplace ,November 2019,40,The Wynwood Marketplace,LollysLook,"The Wynwood marketplace is an outdoor venue that has live music, a bar, food trucks and small shopping areas. It’s a very fun area. "
"Lovely, yet not overwhelming and a little pricy",February 2019,30,The Kampong,etwinschm,"First off, visitors should be advised that ideally an appointment is needed to visit this NTBG. Otherwise, you'll spend ten minutes roaming around in the area in an attempt to find the main entrance. Once you'll have found it you'll be busy finding out that you actually have to call somebody using the intercom at the red gate. If you manage to overcome these obstacles you'll be met by a very friendly assistant who hands you a map of the botantical garden and takes the entrance fee from you. I should note that $15 is a little pricy compared to how the botanical garden shapes up in the end. We've been to a number of botanical gardens before - especially to other NTBG branches in Hawai'i - and we must say that this one was a little disappointing. The display of plants and flowers is quite limited (and I'm not talking about them being in bloom - we know that not all flowers can't bloom at the same time in a botanical garden). However, we were left behind with the feeling that $5 of entrance fees would suffice to maintain such a garden."
Tranquility,April 2018,40,The Kampong,Y J,I was surprise but it is enjoyable. There are many different fruit trees that workers keep them with love . If you like peace this is the place to find it !! I was told that Dalai Lama spent time there.
Home of Dr. David Fairchild,April 2019,50,The Kampong,Arielfl,"While Fairchild Tropical Gardens is a popular tourist attraction not many people know about the Kampong. I held off on visiting because I wasn't sure how it worked. All you need to do is call during their operating hours and make a reservation. The reservation does not need to be a precise time, it's okay to ball park it but they need to know you are coming. Once you arrive call them on the intercom and they will open the gate. Park and walk up to the house to pay your entrance fee of $15. They will take card or cash. If I came back I would make a point of arriving for a guided tour. You can tour on your own but there is so much to see that I think you will get more out of the visit if you walk with a guide."
The Kampong,August 2019,40,The Kampong,387indy,"A 9 acre tropical garden, former home of botanist David Fairchild. Its a National Botanical Garden. It has over 50 varities of mango, many exotic fruit plants. It has flowering trees, from peanut butter fruit to royal poinciana. You can do a self guided tour."
"Amazing place, amazing yoga",August 2019,50,The Kampong,erinfischer23,"I frequent the Kampong not only for the beauty, but also because a local yoga teacher — Samantha Reynolds — teaches a gentle vinyasa here regularly. One of the most beautiful places in all of Miami."
A Must-Visit in Little Havana,October 2018,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,rob60607,"This is definitely worth a stop on any Little Havana tour, whether you're part of a group or exploring alone. Highly recommended."
Beautiful artwork,November 2018,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,Nopuma,This location was our meeting point for the Little Havana Food and Walking Tour where we met the artist.  He has an incredible story and an amazing talent.  His artwork is expressive and bold; I became an instant fan.  We are so happy to be able to purchase a couple of unique pieces to add to our art collection from our travels.  Mr. Gainza and his wife were down-to-earth and humble; we are glad to have met them.
Beautiful art and drinks in Little Havana in Miami,January 2019,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,kathrynh992,"This is a small gallery with big art; and, well worth the time to visit."
Best mojito in Little Havanna,April 2019,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,Trish M,Agustin is a talented artist who brings his artistic ability to his drink making.   He makes the best mojito in LIttle Havanna. The lime ice cubes made for a tasty drink.
Fun find in Little Havana,June 2019,50,Agustin Gainza Arts and Tavern,aliinah,"Agustin and his wife were so welcoming and kind when my daughter and I wandered into the cafe to escape from a really bad bus tour. We fell in love with his art and enjoyed hearing the story of how their gallery transformed into a cafe. It's unusual to find an artist sitting right there at the front of his gallery, painting! I wish I'd had more time to spend there and will definitely go back if I return to the area."
Majestical Elegance,March 2017,50,St Patrick Catholic Church,papag611,"When you need a very nice Catholic Church in Miami Beach, St. Patrick's should serve you well. This is the highbrow church on the beach. Andrea Boccelli has graced the church with his surprise appearances and soprano singing on occasion. "
Historic and Welcoming Catholic Church on Miami Beach,December 2017,50,St Patrick Catholic Church,SBHTravels,This is a beautiful and historic Catholic Church on Miami Beach with a convenient schedule of English and Spanish day and evening masses. If attending midnight mass during Christmas holidays be aware that Andrea Boccelli has been known to show up and sing with the choir and as a result if you want a seat you need to be there when they open the doors at 10:30. 
Beyond AMAZING!!!!!!,October 2018,50,St Patrick Catholic Church,Syrosfan,"This Church is SPECTACULAR!!!!!... And the Music is the most incredible I've ever heard!!!!!!!!!... The Priests and Staff are incredible.... They welcome everybody - regardless of race, religious beliefs, creed, sexual orientation etc etc etc.  I've never felt so welcomed and filled with love.  I will definitely be back!!!"
Enjoyed a beautiful Sunday morning Mass,November 2019,50,St Patrick Catholic Church,GailGermany,"Took the free trolley from South Beach to this lovely church.  It was the first Catholic Church on Miami Beach. The full choir provided the music which made it very special. Although a tourist, I felt very welcomed. Afterwards there were refreshments."
Art Galley ,February 2018,40,Peter Tunney Experience,LollysLook,The Peter Tunney experience is a fun art gallery in the Wynwood graffiti park. You can browse the art pieces and enjoy the works.  
Interesting Work,December 2018,40,Peter Tunney Experience,Jemom68,We wandered in here while visiting Wynwood and found the work interesting. It isn’t really our style with all of the text in the art but Tunney clearly has a vision that is well executed and interesting. The exhibit is well laid out with the plenty of room to view the works. 
Amazing,January 2019,40,Peter Tunney Experience,rschagrin,They have an unusual collection of pop art. Also some amazing chandeliers.
Amazing Talent,February 2019,50,Peter Tunney Experience,dalem35,Cradled in the heart of Wynwood Walls spectacular graffiti sits Peter Tunney’s gallery.’:Tempus Fugit” carries his theme. Many of his works give Andy Warhol’s artworks a run for the money. His collage work is fascinating if you look closely; his messages profound; his attention to detail amazing. The gallery is his workplace and I was fortunate to spend many minutes picking his fruitful brain and enjoying his quick wit ... check him at next year’s Super Bowl and let your imagination roll. He also has a collection of humongous chandeliers from the demolished Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.
Inside ,November 2019,40,Peter Tunney Experience,LollysLook,The Peter Tunney Experience is inside the Wynwood Walls. It’s a gallery boutique with art pieces and souvenirs. You can spend a long time browsing and appreciating the art. 
Great Views,October 2018,40,MacArthur Causeway Bridge,SAB5859,"We went across here several times on the open to bus tour during the day and at night.  You get fantastic views of different parts of Miami, the vies at night were really good."
The Bridge with the Stunning Views,March 2019,40,MacArthur Causeway Bridge,TheExplorerFamily,Go on it at least once to take in the scenery.
Took a taxi over it ,April 2019,30,MacArthur Causeway Bridge,StephenCr0ss,Not great and there was an accident on the bridge so lots of lengthy  delays. You only have a few choices to get to the beaches . Nice houses on the islands off the side. 
Works being done early July,July 2019,50,MacArthur Causeway Bridge,TERRAvelista,"No toll to be paid here, unlike up north where the signs are so bad no wonder we 'landed' on a toll road entering Miami and now weeks later we are still waiting for their fine via the car rental plus probably something else to blame us for their tactics designed to take more money from tourists.... as they do not do this to the locals probably."
Fun!,November 2017,40,Pinto's Farm,LulaBK,I found the staff to be particularly helpful and accommodating on the day we visited as they assisted us with obtaining discounted tickets. That goes a long way. For sure we are fans!
Birthday outing with family and friends,February 2018,50,Pinto's Farm,massielh2017,"Had the pleasure of visiting pinto farm his past weekend (End of February). Cost is $13 per person children under 1 are free since they can’t really ride much. All rides are included (bounce house, pony rides, hay rides, paddle boat rides, petting zoo. I will say bring hats, mosquito repellent just in case, sun screen, they accept credit and cash in all food stations, the food station by the boats has a more selections on food, food is costly along with drinks, I would bring bottled water. No coolers are allowed. They have natural fruits smoothies along with individual pizzas, chicken tenders, nachos and cheese, corn dogs, hamburgers, ext. check hours before visiting and plan to spend the day there so you can get your moneys worth. The kids enjoyed it and were beat after the days end. Everyone was very nice and respectful. "
Fun on the Farm!,October 2017,50,Pinto's Farm,Janin E,"We really loved it here. We visited as a family for the harvest fest and it was awesome. We rode the paddle boats, enjoyed the petting farm and had great fun on the tractor. There was a hay maze and plenty of photo opportunities! We are returning for Easter! Loved this place!"
awsome place,April 2018,50,Pinto's Farm,Jesus H,"is a very familiar place, my daughter enjoy it a lot. it makes you feel very comfortable and there is varieties attractions for kids."
Horrible experience on Sunday Easter,April 2019,10,Pinto's Farm,fernandez0822,"I bought tickets to go for my son's first Easter during the afternoon session, and it was the worst waste of money. $19 per person and everything was terrible since we got there. No enough parking space, a long line to enter the place (even though I bought the tickets online, they asked us to make the huge line to enter). The advertisement stated unlimited rides but it was impossible to enjoy any of the rides since the lines were huge. They sold tickets without taking into account how many people they could handle. The place was terribly crowded. The Egg hunting was awful, faked eggs made with polyfoam, nothing inside the eggs, not chocolate eggs, and not enough, if you were lucky you could find one, most of the kids were crying and complaining because they got nothing. It was very disrespectful to sell tickets for such a disappointing experience. I won't go never again."
We won some money!,December 2018,40,Casino Miami,KristenT929,"This was my first casino experience and I really enjoyed myself. Since it was our first time coming here my husband and I both were given $50 free play. With that money we won around $150, on the house! We didn't spend any of our own money except on drinks and poker. If you have never gambled before and wondered what the ""business center"" type machines are like, it's a lot like that. The poker doesn't even have a dealer, it's all done on computer screens, really comfortable setting for someone inexperienced like myself."
Approach with caution,February 2019,20,Casino Miami,Dave L,It's a sketchy crowd. Slots only. First time to a casino in Miami for me.  Skip if are used to a more lively seen.
50$ free play for first timers ,March 2019,40,Casino Miami,waneb2019,"Very nice greetings, only poker tables that are live. I won 150$ from the free 50$. Whiskey and cokes were 4$ and very strong."

Delightful surprise,November 2018,40,American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora,Michael L,"This small but handsome facility is a study in stark and white when you first walk in. The color explosion came when I explored the Celia Cruz exhibit. She's a long-time favorite so it was a treat to learn her history, watch some videos, hear her music and even see some of her costumes. I look forward to visiting the museum when it brings in another exhibit.."
American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora,January 2019,40,American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora,387indy,"The décor is a study in stark and white, the building is not large but it shows strong. The current exhibit is "" Forever Celia""."

Interesting on a Sunday night,November 2017,40,Brickell Avenue Bridge,Reasonable50,"It is fun to watch all the boats, big and small come in from a Sunday or Saturday after being out on the ocean.The girls are scantily clad and the boys bronze. Only in Miami. Rich and, not so rich. Take in the view from the 16th floor bar in the Epic hotel at twilight. An interesting and rhythmic  spectacle at times. Fun."
Drawbridge in downtown?,March 2018,50,Brickell Avenue Bridge,Ahems,Brickell Bridge runs across the river and is drawn up when a large ship passes beneath. It is amazing how much traffic it backs up while drawn up. It is always fun to walk acrossed and look down into the water.
only a bridge,October 2018,40,Brickell Avenue Bridge,piotrh1982,Bridge like a bridge :) I don't know why it's here... nothing special there. Maybe only the views to the city and skyscrappers
Nice draw bridge ,May 2019,40,Brickell Avenue Bridge,StephenCr0ss,Interesting bridge that rises to let the larger boat traffic pass underway. It’s a short walk over it. Recommended.
Orchid extravaganza,January 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Suzanne L,We have an annual membership so we can see this massive botanical garden often.

Amazing!,April 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,vox303,"We love this place, even though the admission is pricey when there's a festival event.  Beautiful layout & wish we could visit more often.  "
Wonderful visit,July 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,SymbioticOz-,"Beautifully kept botanical garden in the heart of Coral Gables, it is always a pleasure to visit, as it is well kept, and there are many volunteers and employees who will be happy to answer any questions you may have. There are also a lot of events throughout the year, most notably tge garden ramble, orchid festival, and mango festival. A must visit for anyone who loves tropical plants."
An absolute delight. Make sure to go to a festival.,July 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,454christinac,Made an absolutely delightful visit to the Fairchild botanical garden. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous. The staff friendly and helpful. I went to the mango festival that was real fun with live music and dancing and various mango themed stands. The butterfly garden is chalk full of butterflies. A great activity for people of all ages.
Great place for family !,May 2019,40,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Joe K,"My wife and I visited here recently with our family.  My grandson who is 2 1/2, loved it.  Plenty of shade to stay under on hot sunny days.  Would love to come back again sometime."
Lots of stores,November 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,MoniqueA593,Great location for shopping.. tons of outlets and restaurants. The outside food court often has live music and and outside bar .
A well known shopping place,May 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,Luis Fernando G,"An atractive and visited mall in Miami. Lot of shops, variety of products, some great offers and special quality shops"
Large scale mall in the Miami Doral area with two cinemas and several restaurants attached.,October 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,Ryan F,Very large attractive mall with several major restaurants and movie theaters attached. All the major name brand stores and some upscale fashion shops. Very spacious mall in the Miami Doral area right off the Dolphin Expressway west of downtown Miami and Miami International Airport (which is just minutes away).  There are several hotels in the area and another shopping mall (Miami International Mall) nearby. 
Shopping and fun for the whole family,September 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,LourdesClark,"Great shopping outlets, great international dining, sports, and lots of kid friendly experience.  Shuttle service is available!"
Well worth a visit  - or two  LOL,November 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,leeswansea,"We found the best way to get there from South Beach was via a shuttle tour.  It was the most cost effective and time saving, ie  30mins.    Bus is cheaper but takes a couple of hours.   We love the mall as we have been before, this time the Micheal Kors had a massive sale on and so did Guess.     There is a huge variety of stores and has something for everyone, including so many labels but not just labels.   The food court was just out of this world.   We had possibly the best meal of our trip from the Latino food counter - it was mind blowing.  We arrived at 2.30 thinking we would be done in a couple of hours, but were there until almost 8pm - and we couldnt cover it all."
Great bike route,July 2017,50,Venetian Causeway,356lenniel,Take a bike from Miami Beach and go this route to Miami downtown. Very beautiful small islands with magnificent mansions and villas by the water. Great place for taking beautiful photos. 
Free & convenient ,September 2019,30,Metromover,Sayeedac1,Free & easy to travel around downtown Miami & surroundings. Regular & often. Not the widest network. Some of the stations are somewhat dicey with homeless people around & quite dirty. 
It is a beautiful CoralGables church near the Biltmore Hotel that should not be missed,December 2018,50,Church of the Little Flower,hilarionmartinez,"This is one of the favorite churches in Miami for weddings and once you enter, you will see why.

Wonderful historic church,June 2019,50,Church of the Little Flower,CouponLockerDotCom,Attended a friend’s wedding  and had a little difficulty with the parking since it was well attended but we managed to be close after all. We enjoyed a mass afterward and the sound system was decent.
Beautiful church,August 2019,50,Church of the Little Flower,hfs1964,"This is probably South Florida most beautiful Catholic Church, the perfect place for a couples weeding, but plant ahead long very long waiting list"
Pretty cool!,July 2019,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,surftravelerpr,Cool brewery with cool Star Wars decoration all over. Had an amazing stout aged in bourbon barrels (if I recall correctly) simply amazing beer. Had few others but this one was the crown jewel for me.
Beautiful Roman Catholic church,May 2019,50,Church of the Little Flower,bccloutier,Lovely edifice with very warm and friendly parishioners who welcomed me to Sunday mass. Within walking distance of Coral Gables’ famed Miracle Mile. 
The Force is Strong in this one,August 2018,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,109ChrisM109,"That being said, the beer was tasty. Something fruity, as I recall. And the atmosphere was casual and laidback. Star Wars art, though. That’s the thing. And it is, for the record, awesome."
"Chill, trendy brewery",October 2019,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,melfymelfy,"My boyfriend and I were spending the day in Wynwood and stopped in to J. Wakefield Brewing to escape the heat and grab a couple of drinks. The place is air conditioned, self-serve water and clean restrooms. We wanted to try a bunch of the beers, which are brewed right on site, so we ordered 5 oz of a few types each. Our bartender was helpful letting us know the most popular beers and (for my boyfriend) the darkest beers. These were served in cute Star Wars-themed “flight” trays, which matches the trendy superhero/Star Wars decor everywhere. The El Jefe was my favorite, and also apparently their most popular. Seems popular with locals and tourists alike. You can also purchase some select cans and large bottles to go. Would highly recommend stopping here on a hot day while exploring Wynwood!"
Good beer,October 2019,30,J. Wakefield Brewing,Beanie14,"We liked the beers here and the Star Wars art but there wasn't much atmosphere, perhaps it would be better on a busier day."
What happened to this place??,November 2019,20,J. Wakefield Brewing,CruiseRalph,"Recently we visited this famed MIami Brewery and found that the “hip” vibe that usually accompanied a visit was gone. What was worse was that we brought out-of-towers with us who are BIG IPA fans to try Wakefields famed IPA brew. Don’t get me wrong...the beer was spectacular and Wakefield has most definitely not lost his touch. However, someone took their finger off the pulse of the ambiance. The place felt like a morgue. There was no music...no vibe. A large screen TV was playing a movie that was being watched by 6-8 patrons. The customer service which was always a big part of the staff had deteriorated into a few employees who just wanted to serve your beer and move on. If you are interested in a great beer...this is a good place to go...just expect a very BORING time."
Cute and a lot of beer,November 2018,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,CityTripLover1,"The place was very cosy and there was a lot of choice for the own-made beer. The beer didn't taste very special, but it was night to try some of it."
Great spot,August 2018,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,jmY3041GL,This was really a neat experience. Located in wynwood it is a great activity after visiting several art galleries. I love the artsy feel of this area. 
Cool Vibe,January 2019,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Tracy F,A smaller venue with a city vibe.  Loved trying all the craft brews and looking at the art in this cool art section of Miami.
Beautiful stained glass and church,June 2017,50,Church of the Little Flower,1817MaryannS,This church is open for you to swing by and visit about anytime. Be reverent and use the side isles. A baptism was happening when we walked in. The church is absolutely beautiful. Look up to see the ceiling. 
The carved windows alone,June 2017,50,Church of the Little Flower,Ausecl,"We slipped inside to see this church.  It is beautifully done with stained class and wood carved windows. The alter and sacrament table are simply adorned and very nice. I felt funny dropping in without head covering and bare shoulders, but guest were there and it seemed acceptable. The dome offers a beautiful central point to this chapel. "
Nice Church in CG,June 2017,40,Church of the Little Flower,FAM1955,"This church is located very near the Biltmore Hotel. Have masses at very convenient hours, and the masses are very good. You leave with your spirit renewed. Is of good size so you will find place to seat."
Elaborately decorated and beautiful church.,August 2016,50,Church of the Little Flower,622elianap,"This is a beautiful church within walking distance from the famed Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. The stained glass windows and ornate decoration make it a coveted wedding destination.  However, it is also a warm and welcoming parish and school."
"Classic, beautiful, gothic church.  Peaceful.",August 2017,50,Church of the Little Flower,Joseph E,"It is rare that one finds a church of such classic beauty anymore.   I only know of three in Florida - one in Tampa,one in St Pete area and Church of the little Flower (AKA St Teresa's).  It is always so peaceful when one visits.  The stained glass is worth the visit alone."
Amazing beers ,January 2019,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,colinwehrle,If you like craft beer you have to stop here. They make some of the best beers on the planet. They have flights so you can try multiple kinds of beers. 
A world class brewery taproom,March 2019,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Resefeber,One of the best breweries in the world with a great taproom. The beers themselves are amazing and the rotating taps offer a glimpse into what makes a brewery world class. The service was friendly and welcoming and they also offer merchandise and beer to go. The place it self is a work of art and must see for any Star Wars fans out there.
Awesome Stouts! 👌🏼,April 2019,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,klattm86,"What a lovely place to enjoy a beer or two. Such a colorful an inviting ambience and friendly service. I went for the stout flight and let me tell you, I might have just found a new favorite! "
Good to try,April 2019,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,alwaysfun2travel,They do have a variety of beer to sample and the prices were reasonable.  We ordered a flight which had 4 beers that we selected and the ones we selected came out to about $14.  We did not feel rushed as we enjoyed the beer.  There is an outside area or you can sit inside  There is a restroom on the premises.
Cool ambient and a good selection of beers.,June 2018,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,amartinezed,"If you want to get out of the traditional Miami's postcard for tourists, go and check this hidden jewel."
Stopped for a beer to let 95 traffic ease up,May 2018,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Moises S,Nice micro brewery in Wynwood.Knowledgeable & friendly staff.Good & varied beer selection.Nice atmosphere.
Interesting Bar,June 2018,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,MrMiamiExplorer,"Very unique bar in Wynwood with a Star Wars theme on both the inside and outside. We especially liked the Darth Vader mural on the outside. Interesting selection of craft beers. Unfortunately the staff were quite rude, and barely acknowledged us. Not much of a food menu beyond some snacks. I would still give it another chance."
Results guaranteed,September 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,emdjrd662016,Beautiful old style Roman Catholic Church. Go there to get married. I did ---50 years ago--- September 1966---still married!!!!!!!
One of the most beautiful churches in Miami,August 2016,50,Church of the Little Flower,Carlos I. N,This is a jewel in the heart of Coral Gables. I was founded in 1926. The architectural style follows the Spanish Renaissance style. This church is near the Biltmore Hotel. 
Got married here,September 2016,50,Church of the Little Flower,Carrie S,"I went to school in st. Theresa, little flower was my parish and still is. I got married here in 2011. This is a jewel in coral gables. Built in 1926. Kept majestically. The church is a historic sight. It's stunning. Mass service is regular hours as in other churches. "
The place everyone dreams to have their wedding at,July 2016,50,Church of the Little Flower,mmateos,The wedding we attended was held during a lovely afternoon with mild weather which made it perfect. The architecture of this church  as well as the inside is breathtaking. I'm glad I was a part of this occasion.
Beautiful Church!!,October 2016,40,Church of the Little Flower,azm3,Beautiful place though and nice for anyone to stop in and see!
STAR WARS BREWERY,July 2018,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,Bunmaster2014,"Decorative eye-catching Star Wars murals. Good service. Some parking in their lot, but expect to park curbside and do some walking. I sampled three of their brews as 5-ounce pours at three bucks apiece. I liked them all. The hefeweizen was my favorite."
Great bar with lots of character & good vibe ,July 2018,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,K-Q-Maione,"We stopped here after seeing Wynwood Walls. We really enjoyed the low key vibe. Great beer, good people, knowledgeable staff. Definitely stop here!"
Chill star wars/action figure themed tap room with great beers,August 2018,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,Scott W,Have wanted to try this out for a while.   Great independent brewery but you cannot find their stuff in stores.   Had a flight and then a pint.   The beertender was very pleasant and knowledgeable.   Their empanadas were HUGE and helped balance the beer.   Will definitely go back.   
"IPAs, Sours and Star Wars - you cant get enough of this",August 2018,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Edward S,"Second place on belated fathers day present from my daughter for myself and my good friend Tim. Victoria was directing us when and where to turn and after 4 minutes of walking she said it is just ahead on the left. We stepped past a wall and were stunned by the huge mural of Darth Vader on the wall. Tim's wife Christina is a huge fan and their two Corgies are Anakin and Luke. We took several pics while listening to one of the JWB team telling us we were in a for a great beer adventure. Walking through the doors Star Wars continued with a wall of various murals and several characters. We found 3 stools at the bar and Andrew came over to tell us about many things including beer, Star Wars and other cool movie things in the tap room. The beer list had lots of IPAs and Sours and we tasted several with Andrew providing indepth knowledge to help us. Tim went with sour for the first round, Punch it Chewie, Victoria and I went IPA with Slamming Bones and Frank White respectively. All were great and we watched the place start to fill as the afternoon progressed. Second round started with a few more tastings. Tim stayed with sour having Stush, Victoria had 24th ST Brown Ale and I went with El Jefe. Again they were all exceptional. We thanked Andrew, stopped and told the owner how much we loved the SW theme and the great beers.We will make another trek with our wives in the next couple months and let them experience the wonder of JWB."
Worth a visit if you are in the area,December 2016,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,silguiste,"I would not go there just for it, but if you are in the area or going to the metro Zoo it is worth a visit. Interesting to see the President train and some of the oldies. "
Unique Experience,December 2017,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Jenn J,We finally tried the Polar Express in Miami this year at Gold Coast Railroad Museum! What an awesome experience! We did first class and my 8 yr old daughter LOVED the whole experience! The extra friendly and super animated staff made the whole night really awesome!
Happy Hour ,October 2017,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,gbheme,"Great little local brewery.   Beers were very good.  Really enjoyed the Sour-Berliner Weisse ""Stush"", and, the Seasonal Pumpkin Beer ""Gordita"".  Parking is difficult,  however well worth a visit.  "
A beautiful Church with great music,January 2016,50,Church of the Little Flower,SeaCam,"We attended 5:30 PM Mass on January 1, 2016.  We were impressed with the beautiful church, music and liturgy.  The Mass was packed and there was a real feeling of community and warmth.  This Church was a pleasant surprise  during our recent visit to Coral Gables while we stayed at the Biltmore Hotel which is right around the corner from the Church.  "
St. Therese de Lisieux at the Church of the Little Flower,December 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,Paminawrites,"The Church of the Little Flower is indeed a beautiful Church, with an extraordinary Architecture (Old Spanish Style.) I have never attended Mass there, nonetheless, I love to light a candle to Saint Therese de Lisieux, whose image is there.  It is such a peaceful place, you should visit it at least once if you live in Miami, even if you are not Catholic."
Beautiful church,January 2016,50,Church of the Little Flower,Fussytraveler440,"The interior of this church is amazingly beautiful and is a must see when visiting Coral Gables.   This is the 90th year of service. Tour busses include the Church of the Little Flower on their stops of historical sites for tourists to appreciate, but people from all over the world choose to be married here and baptized at Church of The Little Flower."
Church of the Little Flower,February 2016,50,Church of the Little Flower,LinnyGables,"The most beautiful church is South Florida. Catholic school is St. Theresa (of Lisieux, France), ""The Little Flower."" Celebrating its 90th year teaching children within the Catholic faith. Our family are long-time parishioners."
Church of the Little Flower,February 2016,40,Church of the Little Flower,CubaPuertoRico,A very nice and beautiful church! It is for Santa Teresita del Nino Jesus in Spanish. The music and the Mass were very moving.
"Incredible beer, underwhelming service",October 2017,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,Ted K,"As far as beer goes, this would be on my top 5 list for breweries in the state of Florida easily. The staff when we have visited has been quite rude, and this is from more than one visit. The beer is incredible just wish the experience was better."
J. Wakefield Brewing - Dec 2017,December 2017,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,V6870HWjamesf,"This was my 3rd visit to J. Wakefield after hearing rave reviews from Brewers in the Chicago/Indiana area.  This place does not disappoint. Lots of creative recipes and artistic interpretation of many classic styles.  Very casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating.  Some visitors brought over food from other local restaurants.  I stopped at Coyo Taco at the end of the street to ""put down a base"".  This is a great place to take a break when you're out on foot taking in all the murals in Wynwood.  This place has quite a following and worth checking out yourself. They had packaged beers and Growlers to go.  Hope to be back next Art Basel."
Great place to hang out and try new beers,November 2017,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,OrionPax,"Of course the art doesn't hurt either. There's a great sci-fi theme to the art, mostly Star Wars related, but some Marvell art as well. Great service and well worth the stop for a beer fanatic."
Other much better breweries,January 2018,20,J. Wakefield Brewing,KarenGilchrist,"Didnt really like this place. Wasnt very nice to sit in, smelt of sweaty gym goers and beer was a bit rubbish. Go to Concrete or Veza Sur! "
Day out with Thomas ,March 2017,10,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Zekeia,"I live in Broward County (Northern Broward) over an hour away. I booked these tickets a little less than a month ago and the vendor will only mail them to your home address... my tickets never arrived... I emailed the museum no response, however the vendor did have my tickets at ""will call"".  There were no lines which is a plus but I guess to be honest I expected more? It seemed a bit unorganized, was expecting more of the theme from the city of Soutar or to see Sir Topem Hat AT LEAST... The Thomas they built was very creative and realistic almost scary with the moving eyes but it looked good, the downside was it looked like they slapped it onto an old train and took folks out a couple of feet and put it in reverse back to the station. The train was filthy, the windows look as if they hadn't been cleaned since 1972. I'm a New York native and am no stranger to public transportation and to be honest I've probably rode on cleaner trains during my commutes back home all my life than the fifteen minutes of being on this train. I was disappointed with the cardboard city scene or whatever on the left ... overall, I felt it could have been much better. Maybe in other places it's different but I was not very happy.  "
Day out with Thomas the Tank Engine,March 2017,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,662oscarv,"Lots of Food, friendly staff, clean bathrooms. "
Huge Disappointment,March 2017,20,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,ThreeOnTheRoad,"We had a groupon for this attraction and were excited to see it.  After navigating our way through Miami, we arrived only to find the entire thing closed!  A couple of hand printed signs indicated it was closed for a special event...but no dates or times were given.  Everything was locked up tight and the parking lot was deserted.  We would have returned if we had any idea when they were going to reopen.  Poor communication for sure!"
Railroad,February 2017,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,rudder139,Been wanting to go to this museum since I was small.  My biggest attraction was the rail car that President Roosevelt used after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The model railroad is nicely done as well.  
Sort of disappointed,November 2016,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Cabana-Boy-and-Girl,We were there on Election Day and it was not very busy.  The attraction is staffed by volunteers and there did not seem to be any around that day therefore there was not much access to the interior of the equipment and the cars that were open did not have any interior lighting making it impossible to see any detail.  The gift shop was interesting but two dollar post cards and limited selection made for a short visit.  The equipment needs better explanation so you know what you are looking at.  The only car with an explanation is the former FDR rail car used during his presidency.  It was interesting but it lacks detail.
Beautiful Mass,December 2014,50,Church of the Little Flower,MyNakedTruth,"Of course, weddings, celebrations. Etc."
Beautiful Church,August 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,BiminiSea,A great place for meditation and feeling connected. I have had several masses here in memory of my mother. 
Traditional Church with simple decor in a great location!!!,August 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,Andy M,"A couple of blocks from Coral Gables's Biltmore Hotel, this is a very old and traditional church (for Miami standards). The decoration is simple but it has the feel of a very traditional church. Masses are conducted in English and Spanish at different times. Great parish and quality of church members. Very safe and beautiful area."
A lovely church of timeless beauty,August 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,ACW2243,"If you are in the neighborhood of the Biltmore Hotel, you need to stop and look at this magnificent church. It is a historic landmark with this current building dating back to 1951 but the original church dating back to 1926. Just walking around the grounds is a calming experience."
Positive vibes,September 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,Mariana R,Very warm and well run. Pastor is extremely enthusiastic and he is contagious. Has brought a ton of new ideas and initiatives.
"good beer, fantastic decor",June 2017,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,ProfPTJ,"No food to speak of. They were fine with my daughter (who is not yet of legal drinking age) hanging out and admiring the art while I sampled the beer. Bartender was friendly, always a plus!"
The Beer Force Is Strong In This One,June 2017,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,Gregg W,"Brewery with a ""Star Wars"" decor but it's the quality of the beer that draws in more than just wanna-be Jedi Knights. Friendly people on both sides of the bar, with a more comfortable feel than that cantina in Mos Eisley."
Good drinks in the middle of all the art,May 2017,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,jennie405,This is a nice place to stop just off the main street in Wynwood while looking at all the art. They have a selection of beer and even a cider available on tap. While there check out their decor which shows their sense of humor.
We went for the Fish & Chips  and it was a great choice,July 2017,30,J. Wakefield Brewing,BlueBsAs,"I wanted to eat scotch egg and fish and chips so when I read on Instagram that the Avenue Miami food truck was there we went. The brewing is very cool, we parked on the street, it was not easy but we found our spot. The staff was super nice, as this was our first time we started with a beer sampling.. Then we have our English meal that was amazing, so well done, we love it. After we tried the gourmet popcorn, for gourmet I was expecting so much more.  The ambiance is for a very young crowd. It was a good night."
Awesome beers!!,May 2017,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Frankarlo c,Excellent beer and environment to have chill and have fun with friends while watching a major sport event. 
A great place for children & history buffs,November 2016,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Bonbear,"This museum is not just for history buffs or railroad enthusiasts, but for anyone who wants to have a good time at a bargain."
Great place to see old trains,December 2015,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,yoyocu,if you want to see and experience what trains looked liked before you were born...this is the place to go.
Cool something to do on a sunday afternoon when it is nice out,November 2016,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Jason C,We were headed to the zoo and stopped here instead. It's a cool old train station with steam engines and cars you can walk through. I didnt get to go in the presidental car because it wasn't open. I did take a the short train ride and rode on the caboose. Which was cool for 6 bucks.
The Polar Express was magical,December 2016,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,luvhostels,"Well, it was magical for little kids but also for me who loves everything Christmas.  The seats are expensive even for coach but it is well worth it seeing the smiles on your child's face.  The trip was an hour long and the ticket does come with some surprises.  If your children are older maybe they won't like it as much.  I think it is perfect for 3-7 years old.  The staff on board keeps us engaged with singing and other surprises (I won't spoil them for you).  When it is time to board, they will board bigger parties first so they make sure your group can sit together.  I do like this system.  The only downside is the traffic getting there is so bad.  So plan ahead and allow yourself enough travel time. It was truly magical.  It is worth doing this at least once with your child."
BEAUTIFUL,April 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,tczig,"This is such a pretty church in the Gables.  It's a landmark.  I don't go to Church here, but that doesn't stop me from acknowledging how pretty it is.  And, I love the name!"
Beautiful,August 2014,50,Church of the Little Flower,TaraCanhos,This is a beautiful church my family belonged to for years. Its a very traditional catholic church with all the beauty of an old style city church. 
Beautiful little church,March 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,ElizaDenver,Lovely location in the prettiest part of Coral Gables. Beautiful to visit. Mother went to the service and recommends.
Carmelite Sisters Concert,April 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,Edmund438,"The Carmelite catholic sisters flew in from their headquarters in Alhambra, CA to provide an afternoon and evening concert.  This was precious and spiritual as well as musically significant.  We attended the afternoon concert.  We are friendly supporters of this great organization of women who have devoted their life to Our Lord and service to our community.  We have visited their facilities in Long Beach, Alhambra and Duarte and the work that they do for the elderly, children and the sick is truly a blessing.  "
Beautiful,March 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,revvac,The construction of this church is remarkable. I went to a wedding and no wonder I ws told many people choose this church for their wedding celebration. The oiutside is surrounded by beautiful old trees.
The best of the home brew bars in Miami,January 2017,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,markj418,We visited quite a number of micro breweries on our stay in Miami and this was the best.The Head brewer here likes to experiment and I like to try new beers. So its was always going to be a marriage made in Heaven.
Great spot,January 2017,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,brantjames,One of the better spots in an improving South Florida microbrew scene. Love the Star Wars kitsch and everyone there was pretty friendly. Outdoor seating lots of people standing around enjoying the good beer
Great spot...,January 2017,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Notsoworried,"We stopped by here after getting advice from the folks at our hotel.  We have a few microbrews around town back home, this one falls along the same lines.  They were not that crowded for 11p on a Saturday night.  We were able to order within 3 minutes of standing at the bar.  The Amber Waves was a best that I had there.  In all we would stop by again to try the others they had on tap."
"Craft beers, Food and Star Wars",March 2017,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,Unagattaincucina,Food consists in packs of gourmet popcorn: we choosed the maple bacon caramel: delicious! And handcraft empanas. So good!
Awesome beer in Wynwood,March 2017,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Garrett H,"If you are looking for great beer in Wynwood, you can't miss J. Wakefield. It's a cool little spot with a couple TVs, great selection of beers and a food truck in the parking lot. Highly recommend!"
Great Museum,February 2016,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,White_Kong,"I lucked out and got to visit on a free day.  Cheap as I am, I was expecting to pay, so that was a nice surprise.  They have quite a collection, and you can walk through most of it.  Took the train ride, and it was fun for what it was.  I can say I've ridden in a caboose now.  If you like trains, It's worth the trip."
A fun 2 hours for little ones,April 2016,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Lovestotravel0982,We visited for a school field trip with our 3 year old son. He really enjoyed the experience. His favorites were the train ride and the Thomas tables.
Presidential Train Car #1,April 2016,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Dean L,"Don't forget your AAA discount, half off or BOGO, not sure which."
Worth 90 Minutes and $8,May 2016,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Ernest J,"If you're a big train buff, this place might not impress. However, if you're looking for something quick and inexpensive, this is an okay place for a family visit. There are a few old train cars, but little interpretation, leaving you wondering what you're looking at. There's quite a few Pullman cars and even two national register historic site railcars. Might be best to check out the website for free weekend and evening special events."
If better kept it would be worth your while,September 2015,20,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Alicia M,It is really an old railroad depot. Not well kept. It is rundown. The two or three train rides are too short to be enjoyed. It is  old trains with antiques inside the trains.
Nice place to cool off!,August 2016,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,Gehrig S,"The cool murals (Star Wars right now), crisp Air conditioning and cold beers make the JWB a great place to head to after walking through Wynwood Walls.  Have a flight of beers to taste all the different things they are busy inventing.  "
Idyllic house of worship,August 2014,50,Church of the Little Flower,Pateem58,Reminds me of my visits to Europe.  Bells chime before mass and the church is beautiful...priests are welcoming and fun
Church School...,September 2014,40,Church of the Little Flower,IngridHA1973,A lot of good people ready to welcome you with open arms to their faith family.  There is always a smile and nice greeting.  It is a pleasure to keep coming back for the service every weekend.
Wonderful place of worship,November 2014,50,Church of the Little Flower,patricia s,if you are in town and need a place to feel the lords peace stop by and worship.the sermon always hits the spot. they have a website with all of the times.
Mass with Soul!,December 2014,50,Church of the Little Flower,Robert D,"Service's @ The Church Of The Little Flower are special, The 10:30 Mass is one that will move your soul with Voice's & Theology."
Ave Maria!,January 2015,50,Church of the Little Flower,loridawriter,"Church Little Flower is one of the most beautiful Roman Catholic churches in all of Miami. (Notice how I said Roman Catholic!) This church is fairly large with a massive organ, tons of church pews, beautiful gold trim about the alter, and stunning ceiling art! I recommend all you Church goers to check this one out! "
A Beer Experience,August 2016,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,559jas,"I love the decor of this place. The first thing you see is a mural of Vader on the wall at the entrance of the establishment. I grew up with Star Wars so it definitely was a draw for me. There is more Star Wars art and fun inside but also for the comic book fan you'll find some comic book heroes decor inside as well. They have a nice selection of beer on draft. 24th Street Brown is my favorite. But if you feel adventurous, J. Wakefield has the most unique beers around. You could go for the Blood Orange Creamsicle or how about the Coco Caramel Sea Salt La Nada? You can really expand your beer horizons and you will find beer that is unlike anything else in the area."
Disinterested bartender,September 2016,30,J. Wakefield Brewing,TravellingAussieBec,Coming from Wynwood Brewery we found this colorfully decorated bar with great beers but with a bar tender who looked and sounded completely disinterested. Perhaps made worse by the great service we got from the previous brewery? 
"Rustic, local, and original",September 2016,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,Miamismith305,"You go into a dimly lit place and you see tables where people are drinking, the bar, and behind the bar, there is a window pane through which you can see the brewing station. This is not your typical place for a first date, more of a place to hang out with your friends. There is also a happy hour."
"Cool bar, with a decent selection of in house brews, at competitive prices (for miami)",September 2016,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Mathew B,"Would visit again, next time im back over the pond in Miami"
Polar Express!! ,November 2015,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,140carlab,"During the holiday season you can book a ride at the Gold Coast Railroad Museum on the Polar Express. This ride is definitely for younger kids (10 and younger) who want to experience the magic of the Polar Express. Night time ride with characters from the movie, chocolate chip cookies, hot chocolate, bells and the star of the night-Santa!! Don't forget to wear your PJs. It was a magical night. "
Back to the future....   GREAT,February 2015,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,htltrvlr,While I am not necessarily into trains.... having the chance to walk inside the different wagons of the times where trains were the main long distance transportation for most people.... is an avoidable trip to memory lane of the hollywood classics.....    perfect for photography enthusiasts    it is a must visit good for all family......    
Not worth the money!,December 2015,10,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Noelle297,"I was extremely disappointed with the Polar Express. The car we sat in had two volunteers that were yelling the whole time.  So between them yelling and singing, and someone speaking over the pa you can imagine the headache we got! You only go forward and backwards on this ride. It really doesn't go anywhere! The hot chocolate you get is made with water and no milk and the cookie wasn't even that good to begin with! The two pictures we took were terrible! When we got to the North Pole I couldn't have been more disappointed! The North Pole was made out of those huge metal shipping containers with cardboard! The sleigh and reindeers and elves sit on asphalt with weeds coming out of it and the federal prison can be seen right behind it! Let’s not forget the elves were dancing the Macarena! When have you ever seen elves dancing the Macarena? Yeah it wasn't the best experience for my husband and I! My son thank God is little and didn't realize it but we were upset with the amount of money we spent!  Never again!"
Interesting but dated,January 2016,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,brwerner,"Subject matter of the WWII dirigibles used by the Navy was interesting, but the materials are dated and could stand some refreshing and modernization.  Many of the rail cars were not open when we were there, and there is a minimum of explanation about the rolling stock.  Loved the steam engine.  Museum store only has Thomas the Train materials."
A great find,June 2016,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,J R,"Had no idea how much we would enjoy this museum. It was great to go inside and see a Zephyr car, a medical car and a presidential train car. Had no idea about the significance of the property until we saw a historical sign. It was a very interesting stop and we were really glad that we went."
A new hope,April 2016,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,934mikkeln,"I went to this place not knowing what to expect.... The place Is amazing, Star Wars pictures on the walls, replicas in the bar and oh the beer is excellent. Only downside is No droid allowed. Best bar I have ever visited."
THIS is the Miami brewery to visit!,April 2016,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,KRMG57,"I tried three of their IPAs and was extremely impressed with all of them. They had a food truck set up out front, however I didn't try it out. Also highly suggest grabbing a bag of their popcorn to go - maple bacon? Holy moly!"
Favorite Brewery in Miami,April 2016,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,ilovestotravel000,This is the brewery that started my love for craft beers. I'm in love with their 'have you seen my stapler?' My close friends and boyfriend are huge beer lovers and I never understood their fascination with breweries until J. Wakefield. There's plenty of seating inside and out. I love the food truck outside. We tend to be there for hours on end and we eventually need a bite to eat. The decor is great- they have star wars themed murals. The staff is really helpful too. I tell them what i'm in the mood for and their recommendations are always delicious.
Serious quality,May 2016,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,FL_BabyMomma,"I am a chick that happens to appreciate a good beer.  This place has several.  Loved their stout, cream ale and ""I think I am French"" varietals. I have now lived in Miami 10 years, and this is the best local beer I have tried so far."
Not bad,June 2016,40,J. Wakefield Brewing,Rachel3108,Very cool bar and there brews are pretty decent. Definitely try the Black IPA (outstanding!) The porter was WAY to smokey. . . felt like i had licked a Weber grill before taking a sip. No food served here so keep that in mind
Well worth a visit.,April 2015,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Anthony P,"Visitors to railway museums are probably well aware of the fact that what is on display is frequently in need of care and attention. Many exhibits have probably suffered the deprivations of time, weather, and vandalism for far too long. Repair, renovation, and reconstruction is expensive, so your modest payment to view what is available will naturally help preserve what is here. Viewing is a pleasant walk with helpful staff to provide answers to questions. What you will see will be rather special, but you probably need to have a love for the steam railroad to get the most out of what is on show. Allow yourself two hours of peaceful viewing."
"Trains, trains, trains",May 2015,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,828TJA,"We appreciated how this museum ties together history, mechanical things, transportation, and life in America."
Loved the trains,November 2014,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Phyllis R,There is also a museum on the grounds displaying pictures of important people traveling on the trains dating back to the early 1900's
Great for kids and history buffs,May 2015,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Mark L,"This is a great place for anyone who loves trains ! They have everything from full sized steam engines to model trains--they even have an air conditioned playroom where you can relax and watch your little monsters play with wooden Thomas trains. There are two train rides, one on a real train from the 1920's and a minature train ride. My boys loved riding in the caboose, they even got to sit up top where the trainman rode. They even have a train that was used to carry rocket parts for the Space Shuttle. The museum's star attraction is the former United States presidential train car. It is covered with armor plating and the windows are bulletproof glass. A great place to spend an afternoon !"
"Model trains to see and full size train cars to walk in, what fun!",June 2015,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,685michellek,"Right next to the Miami Zoo, there are indoor and outdoor trains to view.  The volunteer staff was more than willing show us around and give us the history of the location, which was very interesting!  The indoor model train area had very detailed scale models and a play area for the kids with Thomas trains.  The outdoor area had full size train cars and locomotives which you can enter if they are open.  There several different train rides you can take for an extra fee.  Overall a very nice place to spend a couple of hours."
Nice place - good beer,December 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,655henrikn,"Very relaxed, nice beertender, good beer and cool merchandise. Wynwood feels so relaxed and good valued compared to Miami Beach."
Super chill ,January 2017,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,BethC676,We will be back! 
Awesome little place for beer lovers,October 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,Tasia15,"No food but there's normally an awesome food truck parked outside where they come in with their menus, you order and its delivered!!"
Cool Little Brewery,April 2017,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,MountainGirl68,"The staff were exceptionally friendly and even though it was a Monday and they were closing, they didn't kick us out in overtime of the Miami basketball game :) I'd definitely return to check out what they're brewing next time we're in town!"
"Good beer, cool Star Wars motif",August 2015,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Tom L,"This is a new place in the Wynwood neighborhood.  We actually were referred here by the owner of the Wynwood Brewery, so kudos to him.  I enjoyed the beer, music, and Star Wars motif."
Excellent floridian Beer,September 2015,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,Giantimo,"I am surprised to find only one review, as the beer crafted in this place is awesome. Bought two types and brought them home, both have excellent taste, body and color. Come on Floridians, support your locals and bring your reviews. Keep it going JWB you Rock!"
Cheers from J. Wakefield Brewing!,September 2015,50,J. Wakefield Brewing,dmartiniup,"Octoberfest time is a good time to stop by J. Wakefield Brewing in the ""hip"" Wynwood area of Miami. The El Jefe Hefeweizen is a good start but the microbrewery has a great selection (including some interesting flavors like Dragon and Passion Fruit) AND their own spiced popcorn by the bag. Funky photography, artwork and murals are part of the Wynwood way, and I loved the beer barrel tables. Owner ""J."" Jonathan is on premises making his brews, so stop by, say hello and have a toast to entrepreneurship at work - providing you with a good reason to go have a micro-brew! "
Walk through different trains...,September 2014,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,VineeP,Good for train enthusiasts...quite a number of trains and engines to see up close. I liked that we could walk through most of the train cars. The model trains were good too. The train ride was okay.
Expected more.,October 2014,20,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,igoramariz,There are four trains to visit but nothing exceptional to learn about. It needs some improvement and especially the wagons: they are smelly and muffled. I expected more of what I have seen.
Phoenix Alumni Meeting,October 2014,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Jennifer M,Visited Gold Coast Railroad did not know it was there. The museum offered train rides pictures and tour of President train car you can walk  through and see how the secret service and first family travel.  We had a great time.  Worth the visit for kids too. 
Drove A Train!,October 2014,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Musartteacher,"We actually visited a few years ago, but it was a dream come true for me. I have always been nuts about trains, and have wanted to see a diesel locomotive up close. I got my wish! I arrived early and got a debriefing of the locomotive. He let me prime the engine and start it up. Then I was able to drive it as long as I wanted, then shut it down. If you don't like trains, you may not like it. If you do, then this is  the right place!"
Polar Express,October 2014,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,nbdruiz15,"We just went on their Polar Express ride.  It was great.  They play the parts from the movie,  read the story,  everyone gets hot chocolate and a cookie.  Once we reach the North Pole Santa comes aboard the train to give the kids a special gift and take pictures with the kids.  Lots of fun for kids and parents. "
Great Beer and Staff,May 2017,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,Johnny R,"Wynwood is by far the best brewery Ive visited in Miami to date. They have excellent beers and such a knowledgeable staff. Also the kombucha from non prophet is amazing. We got a awesome flight then a growler of kombucha to drink while we walked around and checked out the art. Again I would recommend this brewery for a good time, great conversation, and amazing beer!"
Polar Express Event during Christmas Holiday..A MUST!,March 2017,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Osgales,"We took the Polar Express during the Christmas Holiday and my kids loved it.  It is a good experience that you should take them to while they still believe in the white bearded guy.  We paid to have the chocolates and cookis and to seat in our own table which is a little pricier but it was worth my kids face.  It is good mentioning that you can wear your PJs (adults and kids) if you go to this event. It recreates the Polar Express movie acted by Tom Hanks. I played the movie for my kids a couple of days before so they would have the story fresh in their minds. At the train they sang the same songs and were dressed and acted the same way so it was a smart thing to do. I never told my kids (8 yr old and 4 yr old) where we were headed so when we enter the station it was very nice to see their faces once they read the ""Polar Express this way"" sign...Worthwhile!."
Wynwood Brewery,December 2017,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,V6870HWjamesf,Great brewery to stop in at when you are in Wynwood taking in the murals.  No food options onsite but many people bring in food from the outside or even food trucks.  I had their La Rubia blond ale.  It plays like a Kolsch or a Cream Ale.  It was nice and not overly bitter.  Great little place in the middle of all the art action.  They have Growlers and cans to go.
Cool Little Brewery,December 2017,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,stephenjo128,"This place had been on my radar for a while since I had not tried any of the breweries in Miami. I definitely recommend to get a flight since you can really try the vast array of beers that they carry. If not into a flight and its nice warm Florida day I recommend the Vienna, it was very smooth and my friend whom isn't a big beer person enjoyed it. I don't recall the name of the IPA but it was very flavorful and not too hoppy.  This place is nice if you want one brew and continue walking around or you can play one of the many board games that they have in the front. The staff is knowledgeable and fast. We made the mistake of sitting under the menu which was awkward since they don't have any paper menus."
Rustic and local,September 2016,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Miamismith305,"A dimly lit place where you can observe the brewing station through a window behind the bar. Perfect for a visit with friends, defenitely not first date material. It also has a happy hour. "
Funky spot in Wynwood with great beer ,September 2016,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Betomata,"In the up and coming Wynwood neighborhood of Miami you will find several micro breweries, but 3 of them are basically on the same strip.   This is one of the stars of the bunch with its La Rubia beer and many other brew concoctions.  Recommended. "
The all rounder!,September 2016,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,will_fezz,"If you are going to visit one brewery to see what it is all about and you are a not beer expert, this is the brewery for you."
Good ... Just good,September 2013,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,NaidaN,It's good for photoshoot or stuff like that... 
Could have been better.,March 2014,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Crystal W,"I will never come back for this event. I truly expected it to be a lot better than what it was. We may however come back just to check out the trains and the rest of the museum if we are coming down to go to the zoo. I don't think I would go out of my way to come back down just to visit the museum. Once we come back, I will review it again accordingly."
A truly hidden history gem!,March 2014,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,M G,Incredible history!
Train Rides NOT Everyday.,June 2013,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Claude P,"Luckily, they had a children's play area with toy trains to play with, and model trains to watch go choo-choo, so the trip wasn't a total loss.  The museum is great, but if you want to ride the big train, be sure to call ahead."
SAD,May 2014,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,gtlopez,"It was such a nice place to go to with the family. It seems so run down lately, so dirty, not well taken care of, no friendly staff other than a girl named Alex who has a twin sister and a guy named Ronnie which our son absolutely adored & now we were told he no longer works there. Those people were friendly,  caring and keptthe train spirit up but now its awful. I feel bad for the children that can't enjoy the museum. We were members but will never renew again. It was my son's favorite place and had his birthday celebration but not anymore. Sad..............."
Nice ambient ,October 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,juliop470,My initial impression was of caution when I saw all the graffiti and exterior of the place. That soon changed to a more relaxed and comfortable sensation caused by the people around and the excellent beer. La Rubia is a light beer with body. October fest is a strong body with some delicious sour aftertaste. Lupesta? the new addition was also very good. This is an excellent place to have a great conversation and fun night.
Casual and Cool,November 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,Arlynes H,Overall a nice place to stop and just enjoy a couple ( or more ) beers while youare browsing along the Wynwood area.
great brewery,August 2017,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,tracyrocks,My boyfriend and best friend and I came here August 2017 after walking around Wynwood for a bit one Sunday.  They loved the beers that they got.
Other better breweries,January 2018,20,Wynwood Brewing Company,KarenGilchrist,"Didnt really like this place. Wasnt very nice to sit in, bright lighting and uncomfy seats and beer was a bit rubbish. Go to Concrete or Veza Sur! "
Great Flight,January 2018,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,232courtneyw,Ordered the flight and had so many options that I had the bartender suggest a few beers. They were great and the atmosphere was amazing.
Don’t waste your money on “A Day With Thomas”,March 2018,10,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,proudmommaof4boys,"This event is all about the marketing. They make it look so enticing. Don’t waste your money. I feel so ripped off. Took my very excited children today and was so disappointed. There is no entertainment for the kids. Just 2 tables with tracks on them and a few trains thrown on them that don’t even work on the type of tracks that are displayed. The train inside is embarrassing.... I almost didn’t take my children in when I saw how filthy and old it was. We sat in that train and sweated for about 20 minutes, again with no entertainment besides 3 lame “trivia questions” for the kids. Pretty much just stared at each other’s faces miserably. I hope I can save many their money! "
Had a blast!,March 2018,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Katerina M,"Just visited the museum today...after reading other reviews didn't have my hopes up...took my 5 and 17 year old with..used groupon for tickets.. it was amazing!!! We had so much fun walking thru different trains..presidents car, dining train, army hospital train etc..they depend heavily on volunteers ..but they have my thumbs up! would definitely visit again when in area... thanks for taking care of our history!!! "
A bit disorganised ,March 2018,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,149stuartc,It was all about chaotic in terms of the information available and what was happening when. Having said that all the staff were polite and friendly and the museum collection itself is fantastic 
Amazing brewery with an even more amazing staff,April 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,ilovestotravel000,"I've been a few times with my friends who are die-hard fans of Wynwood Brewing Company. Our last visit was for a bottle release of theirs. We spent the entire afternoon outside listening to a live band they had. We were there for hours and had an amazing time. I also can't say enough good things about their staff. Everyone is beyond friendly and helpful. Overall, just great people. The beer is great and the people are friendly- what more can you ask for. I'll never miss a bottle release after this- the bottles we bought are beautiful. The tops were hand-dipped in wax and the labels were printed on wood. Unique and they make an excellent gift. I look forward to going back!"
Thumbs Way UP On My 1st Visit,May 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,FedoraTraveler,"To truly enjoy some engaging conversations with friends, plan a visit to Wynwood Brewing Company."
Food and drinks were great!,May 2016,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Stephanie P,"Great service, yummy food and awesome selection of beers and drinks.  Went with a group of friends.  Moderate pricing.  Would def come again"
If you like trains -- or presidents,February 2013,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Nelsontouch,"I happened to be here on Presidents Day, which made seeing the Pullman that FDR, HST, and DDE (as well as Ronald Reagan one time) used a special event. The presidential car is the highlight, but for anyone with even a marginal interest in trains, the CGRM is definitely worth a stop. You can walk through several of the preserved/restored cars and visit an amazing collection of model and toy trains.  Very reasonably priced."
A Train Graveyard where Thomas the Train visited!,March 2013,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Jackie5LilRascals,peace and blessings
Fun and educational,February 2013,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,flymemom,"Took my grandson here. We both loved it. You get to climb into many old cars, even the Presidential one. Great place for a photo shoot also."
Needs (a lot of) Improvement...,November 2012,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Isauro9,"First of all, the nice thing - everybody is a volunteer there; however, you cannot distinguish who is who (that is, volunteer or visitor). We suggest the volunteers to wear an identification t-shirt a cap and blue jeans. Secondly, the place has lots of nice trains; however, they are extremely (and unnecessarily) dirty and smelly - a little baking soda would do wonders there (they could be hidden). The room with the miniature trains is nice, but the poor light is depressing. Furthermore, some painting in the walls would be great. This museum is very close to the Metro-Dade Zoo, which is great. They should take advantage of this. In summary, cleaning, painting, better lighting, and dressing properly is what that place needs. It has a great potential and history."
pleasant surprise.,April 2013,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,988John988,I recently visited the Gold Coast Railroad Museum in Miami and had a very pleasant surprise.  Among their many historic trains and engines is the Presidential Railcar Ferdinand Magellan.  This is a really amazing piece of history which has been recently restored with grant money.  This was the famous train Truman and President Roosevelt used in World War Two.  I am a real history buff and found this display amazing.  The museum had other very interesting displays as well including one on World War two blimps.  I highly recommend this museum for all ages.  I saw a school group at the museum the day I visited and I am glad of that because this is something all school children need to see!  John Crow
Very cool place!,June 2016,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Rachel3108,Small brewery with great beers and a friendly staff! Definitely do the flight so you can sample a bunch of their brews. No food served here so definitely check out KUSH if you are in need of a bite. 
Cool brewery in an awesome neighborhood ,June 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,teemu111,If you're visiting Wynwood it's good idea to visit this place too.
Great option @ Winwood!,June 2018,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,Godolas,"Great place, nice vibe and staff, very good craft beers, including #lacapitana, which I had the chance to taste! Awesome! Even though the back of the brewery was running out of light (and I didn't have the chance to to participate on their 6pm Brewery 's tour), I'll come back. Thanks guys! Keep on rockin!"
Amazing Brewery!,June 2018,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,Eric K,"Terrific brewery with a large selection of beers on tap in a very interesting neighborhood with all the graffiti on the buildings.  The brewery is in a very small building, so it can get quite crowded.  Also, no food options, but you can order food in.  All in all, a must try if you're in Miami and you like craft beer."
Great find in Wynwood,June 2018,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,carriandmatthewr,"Very cool little brewery in hipster Wynwood.  Like many smaller breweries, the neighborhood appears a little sketchy, but head inside anyway and have a flight or two of beers.  Porter was very well balanced with a nice malty finish that wasn’t sour like a lot of porters.  They have a barrel aged beer if you like your beers to taste like whiskey, but an overall good selection of brews to sample.  They don’t have food, but you can bring in your own...Uber Eats anyone?"
Worth a look,November 2011,40,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,billonbribie,Beautiful tree lined streets head you to a old Florida mansion Merrick house it is worth seeing see what it was like in the early 20th century before all the concrete and skyscrapers 
"wonderful place, no one there",July 2012,20,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,Michelle W,"This is a great historic site but they are rarely actually there. I went several times when they were supposed to be open,but the site was actually closed. I picked July 2012, as  the date I visited, but this actually happened more than once."
Nice Little Place,April 2013,40,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,Eli G,Sooo nice to walk around and spend a nice afternoon!  It's in Coral Gables which is a nice place in Miami.
Great Craft Bar!,February 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,LMigue,THANK YOU Guys!
Chill Taproom,January 2016,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,samls86,"This little taproom/brewery is a little off the eaten Wynwood attraction path, but well worth it!  Great beers, chill atmosphere, free wifi, board games.  This is a great place to bring visiting friends or to see if you're in the area!"
"Awesome, Must Visit!",January 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,stacieb541,Great little place to stop for a beer after a viewing of some cool wall art in the Wynwood District.  Great brewery & an all around fun place!  Be sure to try the sampler!  Staff was great!
Fun Bar with a BBQ food truck on the side,October 2015,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,wavestravels,"I'm not a big beer drinker so I can't tell you about the beers. (Lame, I know.) However, the atmosphere was great. Its got a young vibe. Caters to the 25-30 age range. Pretty cool art on the walls and their beer glasses are beautiful (and available for sale). The food truck which isn't a part of the establishment at all was delicious. They will even bring you the food into the bar. The area of the bar looks a bit sketch but the entire area is getting built up and pretty much looks like that. "
Private Tour Was Excellent,February 2016,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,254JenniferA,"The Tap Room is spacious, so it never felt too crowded. There were plenty of seats and the seating at large tables encourages people to talk and make new friends."
good tour about the Merrick house,July 2014,40,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,cazu247,"We came for an event that included cooking classes, ice cream truck and a gardener showing from how to grow herbs but making your landscape better.  But what we really enjoyed was the tour of the Merrick house  because we did not know the history of Coral Gables and how his vision developed the gables.  I would encourage everyone to attend an event there. "
Excellent tour,February 2014,40,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,johnpS4312GB,We have tried several occasions to visit this site and finally we were able to hit it right and have someone available to give us the tour.  Well worth the wait!
Train Museum = Train Wreck,April 2018,10,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,CostaRicaOutsider,"On the whole, not a good time."
A Great Experience,July 2018,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Gu1otta,"I'm not sure why people are posting such bad reviews. My family & I went around 11 AM. We walked around & checked out the trains at our own pace. I don't remember how many trains were available to go inside but it was probably around 5. The one disappointment was that Thomas the train wasn't there but other than that, it couldn't have been better. We had been waiting 4 years to bring our kids here & loved it."
"Really interesting on a rainy day, but needs to have a lot of money spent on it.",August 2018,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Cpenser,"We were there on a rainy Sunday afternoon. There was plenty to keep us occupied for 2-3 hours. We went into every carriage that was open and peered into the closed ones. It was clear that many of them were in need of renovation. We especially enjoyed the train with a bar and the carriage with the observation deck above it. In a break between the clouds, we saw the model railroads and the Thomas tables. We were impressed by the material about the African-American experience on the railways. We wish that some generous millionaire would be willing to donate to this museum."
fascinating!!,September 2018,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,lalocadr19,"Went here Sunday afternoon, want to see museum. Museum is free for military, plenty of train cart to explore with family, cart do get hot. Lot of history in the available cart, small train to ride the museum good for the kids."
For Miami Fl to have a railroad museum is a miracle. IMO,July 2018,30,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,itellitlikeitis,"I went to Miami Fl in July 2018 it had been about 27 years since I was there and a lot has changed in that time period. Straight off I will say visiting this railroad museum in July was very hot there is some shade but with a lot of steel around and overhead it just adds to the heat you're feeling. I enjoyed myself very much but with the heat and blood thinner in my system I could only stay an hour. IMO Its best to come here in the fall and spring months for Miami, Fl. You do see A lot of old engines and passenger cars even a Presidential railroad passenger car. Overall its worth the trip to see this railroad museum. "
Small but fun,December 2018,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,latraveler393,We stopped in for a beer on a Saturday evening. Service was good and staff was friendly. Fairly large selection of beers with something for everyone. They also have board games you can play. The place is small but wasn’t very crowded while we were there. If you’re staying downtown I would highly recommend taking an Uber or Lfyt since the neighborhood didn’t appear to be the safest area. 
"Small place, no atmosphere, good beer",January 2019,30,Wynwood Brewing Company,M3427FIwilliams,"The beer here is very good which is the most important thing. However, this place is quite small with literally no atmosphere and no outdoor seating. The staff were very pleasant and the prices were reasonable. Great street art in the surrounding area."
"Ok Brewery, NBD",January 2019,30,Wynwood Brewing Company,BronxBornLady,"Ok no big deal brews. We sampled 4 beers, Mango beer was yuck.Nutty blond beer was okay and the porter was comparable to Yuengling Porter. Female staffer lacked intelligence. Facility location In sketchy spot, also be mindful this is a small place,can easily be missed."
You gotta see it to believe it!,July 2014,50,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,George S,"There is no way to describe this place. You simply MUST see it. It's BREATHTAKING, to say the least. A piece of history nesseled in the most beautiful garden you can possibly imagine. You gotta see it to belive it. "
Is it ever open?,August 2014,10,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,NPSRVA,"This was in the summer of 2013 and I am just now finishing this review. I did not realize that it was in draft form. Hopefully, it has improved because it is full of Coral Gables history. "
Surprisingly Modest Abode,June 2015,40,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,banjo45,George Merrick evokes thoughts of the great developer of Coral Gables. Our visit to the Merrick House was an eye-opener. The house is small and modest and well restored. The docent who gave the tour provided a lot of interesting historical perspective about the man and the development of Coral Gables in the 1920s. Total visit time is about 45 minutes. Worthwhile if you are interested in the history of south Florida.
"Chill, friendly, and craft lover's spot! ",August 2015,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,justash11,"While exploring Wynwood Walls, we came across a door that said ""Beer"" on the door and figured we would check it out. We were glad we stumbled on the gem. The employees were chill, friendly, and knew their beers. Definitely one of the best breweries we have visited in Florida. Our favorite beers were La Rubia and La Mami!"
Best Part Of Our Miami Trip,August 2015,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,Brent W,"This was our favourite part of our day in Miami. We admittedly spent more time there then we had planned, but between the amazing authentic greek food truck that fed us outside to the gorgeous selection of beers that they had it was everything we could have wanted. We happened to be there the first day that they began bottling their beer for general consumption so spirits were high. We ordered a few flights of beer and then branched off to our own preferred beverages. They had two of their most junior staff working while we were there and they were still knowledgeable and friendly. We spent our entire time seated at the bar and talking with them. We were fortunate enough to have one of the owners (Pop's)  and their brewmaster enjoy a beer and a chat with us as well. This place is 100% worth your time while in Miami. "
Don't forget the Growler!,July 2015,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,Ravi B,Love this place. They have recently changed the decor have not visited since the change. But the beers are cold. The staff is knowledgeable and the people are awesome. Grab a Growler to go and make sure you go back for the refills. They have 1/2 off on certain times.
Did not exceed my expectations,September 2015,30,Wynwood Brewing Company,Giantimo,Did like the fact that you can take your favorite beer home and bring bottles back to buy more.
Cool Brewery,July 2015,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,SteveK0605,"Visited on a Thursday right at noon. They do 1/2 price grolwer fills from 12-1. Very good beers and you can see whats going on in the brewery behind the glass when sitting at the bar. There is lots of cool local art work and it is a very chill atmosphere during the day, i haven't been at night but I would assume that it gets busier. will go back."
Old Miama Charm in a Wonderful Historic Home,January 2015,50,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,John J,"Make a reservation and stop by this beautiful artifact of by-gone old Miama vernacular architecture.  The interiors make you want to climb into a time machine and head back to a more peaceful time.  Wonderfully preserved and explained by the docents, this is a must-see for those visiting Coral Gables for the first and only time.  It's also a pleasnat surprise for resudents that never took the time. Pose for your ""Summers in Rangoon"" photos on the porch!"
Closed September 2015 till  new year,November 2015,10,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,smallportions,"It's being renovated but not well advertised that it's been closed- staff at Coral Gables museum were not sure., and the Merrick web site is not very explicit !"
Disappointed to find it closed,February 2019,10,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Ian C,"Sorry, but it has put me off making the long journey there again."
We need to save this historic place,March 2019,40,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,hectorfrommiami,"The Museum has a lot to offer, but it needs sponsors and more volunteers to help cleaning and maintaining the place.  If it gets the proper care I am sure it will attract a lot of visitors.  Even in the condition it is, I am going back.  I spent today a couple of hours there and took over 340 photos, but for sure I will be back and I sincerely hope that the place will flourish."
Skip it,April 2019,20,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,scott r,"Despite some reviews I went prepred to like this, wanting to like this, routing for the underdog.  Well, it's a dog anyway.  You can go through some old carriages; the more intact ones were interesting.  There's an attempt at AV; the best one was almost drowned out by louspeakers playing 'period' music.  Display items often confined to those of interest to serious engineers rather than those curious about railroad travel.  Make no mistake, I'm a big WWII ship fan - I'm not expecting 'restoration' but additional effort at presentation (underscore) would have helped.  There's a presidential rail car on exhibit for another $12, but having spent the basic admission for what amounted to not much I was not in a generous mode.  No one else seemed to avail themselves either.  The model RR (again, a big fan here of a well done layout) was just sad.  I admire the preservationist spirit, but here the whole thing just misses the mark."
Almost the first Saturday of the month free day,June 2019,20,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,brianinboca,"Do not go if you have to pay. The first Saturday of every month except march is free.  For free it's not bad walking around some of the trains. The presidential car is not open to really go into separate or that they don't tell you you need to take and I did not see available on the website.  Do not I repeat do not take the train ride.  It is billed as a 25 minute ride. It is not. Is a three or four minute ride repeated five times. You go up a little bit literally a little bit it's weeks a lot to put in reverse you go back a little bit it squeaks a lot you go forward again.. the 25-minute ride implied in the website is absolutely misleading. So to reiterate do not pay to go there, and absolutely did not take the train ride to not say I didn't warn you if you don't listen"
Great for rail fans or history lovers!,November 2019,50,The Gold Coast Railroad Museum,Ted Y,"I had a few extra hours to spend in the Miami area, so I decided to visit the railroad museum. The railroad has many train cars open to go through so you get an idea of what rail travel was like in the early to mid 1900’s. There are a couple steam locomotives on display as well. The train cars are all parked under a large shed in case it were to be raining you could still visit and enjoy. The highlight is the Ferdinand Magellan, the rail equivalent to Air Force 1. The car is available for tours, so be sure to ask to include that tour as well. A separate building houses several model railroads. Park type train and real train rides are available from time to time, so be sure to ask about them. There is a gift shop."
The First Causeway is the Best causeway !,October 2018,50,Venetian Causeway,papag611,"Venetian causeway is a great way to see Miami from the inside > out! First You will drive past one of the best neighborhoods in the entire 305 and second, the views afforded in between islands will give you angles to view this Magic City through a brand new prism. Toll required from and into the city of Miami.  "
Great Place to Run!,December 2018,50,Venetian Causeway,latraveler393,"We went running here two separate times during our visit to Miami. It’s very safe and the views are amazing. Great place to walk, bike or run!"
Do not come to Miami and not visit the Venetian Causeway and islands!,January 2019,50,Venetian Causeway,dktos,Well worth a visit.  But do note that there are no restaurants or cafes on the island.
Across the 6 islands,April 2019,40,Venetian Causeway,StephenCr0ss,Rent some bikes and cycle over the Causeway. Busy spot with a lot of very expensive houses. Recommended 
Excellent IPA,May 2015,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Steve H,We started with beer flights and agreed the IPA was the best of the bunch.  Next time I may get a growler of it and take some home.   Small place with friendly staff.  They offer tours but we didn't take one.
Refreshing,May 2015,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,lucycU3302DK,"We gave Wynwood walls a whirlwind walk around so was looking for things to do nearby when we saw this on Google maps. The bar staff were very knowledgeable, super helpful and friendly.  The beers were great.  I like that they do beer shots so we can try several different ones.  Well recommend this."
A real locally owned brewery!,July 2015,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,grnfern,"This brewery is locally owned and has about 12 different beers on tap.  It is in the Wynnwood neighborhood, which has a lot of graffitti and this liberalesque brewery has a lot of local art on display and for sale.  Everyone who was visiting was very cool and the bar tender was great entertainment and friendly and eager to please!"
Saturday Afternoon,July 2015,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Thirtysomething,"We visited the brewery on a Sat afternoon, we are not beer snobs, but we know what we like and had never visited a brewery before. Overall, the experience was good but I am not sure if it was because we quickly started a conversation with the table next to us and hit it off! The location is small and darkish with good music and blasting AC. They have the tipical bar games such as jenga, connect four etc, and the beer board and selection is very comprehensive. We had a flight, and enjoyed several. As far as the bar staff, can't say that they were especially helpful, they just filled our order, did not ask any questions. Not sure if they offer brewery tours, but it would probably be interesting. They do not serve food, but there was a food truck outside. One of the things I enjoyed the most was that the crowd was VERY diverse. There was the typical younger hipster crowd from the area, as well as older people in their 30s, 40s, 50s and even a couple of families with toddlers (not sure about that but hey, to each its own)...overall I would say its a great hang out with good beer, and if you happen to find great company like we did...even better!"
cool spot in wynwood,May 2015,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,affordablebeachlivin,tried some tasty beers here...in a slightly sketchy area but cool neighborhood feeling tap room.  Would definitely stop by again. Awesome to explore the wynwood art walls if you are in the area
Fab beer,May 2019,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,NatandPidge,This is a cool little bar with a fantastic selection of beer. I’m still gutted there wasn’t a flamingo t-shirt in my size! 
Fun place!,May 2019,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,chester110105,"This was my first visit, and I enjoyed it! Great selection of beers, and a fun, casual vibe. Only thing, it does get VERY busy and crowded; it's not a huge amount of space. But what a fun place! I hope to be back!!"
"Great beer, small space ",June 2019,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,gregoryr634,Came with a buddy to have a La Rubia and it was my first time actually visiting the brewery.  Chill place and liked that they had food available for purchase.  Just wish it was a bigger space. Bar can get packed quickly.
Poor customer service ,July 2019,10,Wynwood Brewing Company,DBernard1029,"I went to Wynwood to take advantage of their discounted growler fills when they first open. Being an avid craft beer drinker, I own several growlers and brought my own to be filled. I was told they don’t usually honor the discount on growlers other than their own, but would honor it for us. Okay, fair, don’t know of many breweries that do this (can only think of one other), but at least they were going to fill our growler. We picked a beer, and after filling the growler (or so we thought) the keg was kicked and they weren’t able to locate another. We weren’t alerted to the fact that the growler couldn’t be filled so we thought it was all fine. The bartender sealed off the growler cap and gave it to us. At this point we noticed there was over an inch of air at the top of our growler. We pointed it out and the bartender said it should still be fine if we drink it fast. Anyone who gets growlers filled, or knows about how carbonation works, would know that this beer was going to get flat fairly quickly. We told him unfortunately we wouldn’t be drinking it for a few days, as we planned to take it back home with us to the other side of the state. Instead of offering to fill the growler with another beer, or pointing out that the growler hadn’t been fully filled before sealing it off, the bartender waited for us to point out the issue and then didn’t really offer any solution. He went to go look for another keg again, then didn’t come back and talk to us about the issue and instead began working on other things behind the bar. It was very clear we were bothered by the space left in the growler, and wanted a solution, as we had expressed that to him. It wasn’t until we prodded and inquired some more that he suggested we fill the rest of the growler with another beer, which was a very odd suggestion. Ultimately, we ended up asking for a refund, which was given. I don’t think I would have been bothered by this experience had it not been for the lack of caring by the bartender. We were made to feel like we were being bothersome for his mistake. I don’t like to leave negative reviews, and typically can find a silver lining in the experience, but this was just flat out poor customer service. "
Worth the visit,October 2019,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Riplis,The Wynwood Brewing Company has a decent brew. They're located in the Wynwood area - not far from the Wynwood Walls. I would recommend to combine the two. We tasted several different beers - Laces (IPA) being our favorite.
Merrick House and Gardens,April 2018,50,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,NoraWetzstein,"Definitely a place to visit to learn more about the Merrick family and how the Gables was started.  House tours are during a specific schedule and  usually given by volunteers that grew up in the Gables.  The gardens are beautiful and have several different fruit trees mangos, avocados, lichee.  The house is currently going thru renovations but should be open soon. "
Very Serene and Pretty!,February 2018,40,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,expeditionkitty,"I went to this park for a photoshoot and it left me pretty speechless. The house is so vintage and beautiful! There's many colors that pop and the Ocean is right next to it. There's also a huge field of grass where many event/activities take place. I heard they also do a night tour which appealed to me very much and id like to do it some time. Overall, very nice, huge park, with lots of nature and beautiful history!"
Lovely Historic Home,April 2018,50,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,VacaCouple2014,Merrick was the architect of Coral Gables and this was his home. It is beautiful and the guides are very knowledgeable and nice to talk to. Take a tour - it's worth it. The gardens are also very nice and you could probably have a picnic here if you wanted to.
Coral Gables The City Beautiful!,July 2018,50,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,thewrightsights,"Coral Gables and the Merrick House is a great place to visit.  The beauty of the city is amazing!  I was so impressed that I put together a video on my Youtube channel at ""thewrightsights"".  Learn a little about the history of this ""City Beautiful""!"
Worth a visit,March 2019,40,Coral Gables Merrick House and Gardens,Ana C,"Nice house, pond with fish and gardens. The museum is interesting about the founder & pioneer who developed the Coral Gables & Miami areas. Nice collections. "
Was safer than imagined ,October 2019,40,Metromover,Viperguy324,"Not bad, they did switch a route on us... but was only 10 mins to get back around. Will use again. Was clean and security did get on and off. "
free mono rail system,September 2019,50,Metromover,Antony P,This was very useful and best of all was free to get around downtown miami the trains were about every five minutes. 
Unique experience in wynwood,December 2013,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,Mandibolas,Overall a great experience good beer and good times with friends. Just be careful on your way there!
Craft brew...,December 2013,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,muchohobbies,"Attendance during two soft openings & grand opening, becoming a ""vine club"" that same night. Cool location. Amazing brew. Great people; staff & patrons. Support LOCAL everything!"
Good place for local beer,December 2013,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,KreyzTravelr,"I went there with my husband and had their IPA, Pilsner, Rauchbier, and others. They were all pretty good. Prices are very reasonable. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Atmosphere was casual and relaxing. Decor was simple, but tasteful. Only one complaint: I didn't like the fact that the letters WB were above the star on the Puertorican flag. That was bad taste"
Oasis in miami,December 2013,40,Wynwood Brewing Company,brantjames,Pretty much a microbrewery wasteland in Miami compared to tampa-stp but this place is legitimate.  Lots of good choices. Try the porter.  On the edge of some tough neighborhoods but nice urban vibe.
Very rich choice of beer styles,December 2013,50,Wynwood Brewing Company,madasha,It's a great place to go for having beer with friends. It's a must for beer lovers. They have more than 10 varieties of beer which is a lot for a small brewery. I was amazed by almost all the beer I tried but I should say for me the black ipa and the father Francisco hold the top position. 
Great Service,September 2019,40,Metromover,OBofNY,"Great service, free of charge to travel around in central Miami. The only downside is that there usually are homeless people spending time in the metro over and at late night makes people feel unsafe."
Useful,October 2019,50,Metromover,Ez2ctheworld,Free elevated train that gets you around downtown Miami. Links to other transportation and runs pretty frequently.
Very Lively and Pretty Must Visit When in Miami,June 2019,50,Espanola Way,Funtel,"Visited Espanola Way while we were on a 3 day pre-cruise trip to Miami.  Our Uber driver struggled to find it, must have been our accents lol.  Beautiful stretch with lots of food choices on offer.  It's vibrant and lovely would recommend."
Our Very First time,September 2019,50,Espanola Way,monalisakita,South Beach Miami Florida was amazing...the energy with the locals was everything. We stayed at the Anglers hotel service was celebrity style...there rooms are amazing we stayed in room 334 you will love this place. We did not want to go home...the night life is fun an keeps you on your feet theres always something to do in Miami...Also go to a place called the PALACE U WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!
Very cool pedestrian walkway,October 2019,50,Espanola Way,Nimotae,Beautiful area with many great restaurants and shopping for pedestrians only. Quite a few Italian Restaurants nestled in with fresh homemade pasta!
Vibrant and great fun,October 2019,50,Espanola Way,TDLines,"Between Washington and Drexel, Espanola Way is effectively one big lively Cuban/Mexican/Hispanic party every night with music and loads of restaurants on either side all encouraging you to dine with them. We stayed just the other side of Drexel at the Casa Victoria Orchid, (another review), and if you walk away from Drexel, there are quite a few millionaire's houses on either side until the dead end. A nice, safe walk after dinner.  "
Not what I expected,October 2019,20,Espanola Way,spreece,"We walk through Espanola Way, which was 1 block full of restaurants & 1 store.  Perhaps because we were here in October, there wasn't much going on or maybe we didn't walk far enough?  "
Fabulous Shopping for the Shopaholic,April 2019,50,Miami Design District,gypsezza,I lived in Miami for 2 years and did this regularly :)
Great shopping and people watching,July 2019,50,Miami Design District,Jemmie33063,"It is like spending an evening in Europe, great stores, wonderful food. There is parking easily available, and there are lots of photo op spots. Great public art with twice a week tours for more in depth observation. The St Roche food market is a delightful food hall with many unusual selections, all reasonably priced and tasty. A great way to spend a day or evening."
Rodeo Drive with a cultural twist,July 2019,40,Miami Design District,LWRFL,"Every high end boutique that you can think of in a uniquely Miami setting.  You can see why people come from all over to ""shop in Miami"".  Great people watching, and some really good restaurants too."
I really like it,July 2019,40,Miami Design District,212carolinac,What I would change is the music that is played as part of the concerts that are held every now and then there. I think that they have nothing to do with the concept of the place and the ambiance.
Bal harbour' s sister ,July 2019,40,Miami Design District,stewcavan60,"Beautiful design, clean, plenty of high end design. I feel like I was in Bal harbour, because everything bal harbour has, Miami has it too. Must visit but make sure your pocket is full."
Beautiful,June 2018,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,pvsparky2018,Very close walking distance from all the sites or hop on hop off trolleys.Well worth the time to walk and enjoy nature.
Small but beautiful ,April 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Alfonso V,"Not far from Lincoln Road, this is a rather small but gorgeous garden, and it’s free!!!  At the gift shop, we were treated very warmly by a gentleman who explained the history of the park.  This great man performed for us a show with amazing hats!!! The design of the park was inspired in the work of famous Brazilian arquitect Burle Marx. "
Lush Regional Park,April 2019,30,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Soleil122,"Small garden with wide variety of local vegetation and grassy field in the middle.  Although there were concrete walkways the Japanese Garden and pathway beyond was not developed; in fact, nothing but a muddy path the day we visited.  Nice addition to visit if you have time.  It's free."
Great Respite from the Heat,June 2019,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,mon h,"Beautiful, green garden that gives shelter from the Miami heat (not the bb team.) Easy to walk to from the beach promenade. We were sweltering a bit and the shade and fountains created a cool oasis in the middle of Miami Beach. Large koi (?) in the pond awaiting fish food. A few seating areas with tables, along with free wifi. Also, clean restrooms and a lovely gift shop. There is even a life or horse-sized unicorn statue to be found in the garden!"
Fun times in Little Havana,November 2018,50,Little Havana,AngelK916,"We were first in Little Havana as part of the city sightseeing tour, visited the cigar shop, sampled some Cuban coffee, and just hung out with the giant ceramic chickens.  Then on our last day we went back on our own and had lunch at a great restaurant that had live music, Mojitos with bubbles and great Cuban food.  "
District with it's own atmosphere,October 2019,40,Little Havana,Boris M,"Really loved this place. I had a feeling like I'm in some other country all of a sudden. It has it's unique style that you can't see anywhere else in Miami. People there are also very nice, I even brought some cigars there, and got some tips on them from the seller!"
Interesting cultural area during the day but probably not smart at night,October 2019,40,Little Havana,phelpsusa,Interesting cultural area during the day but probably not smart at night.  Most places have gates and bars on the windows.  We took a 2 hour walking tour which was great.
Trip to Little Havana,September 2019,50,Little Havana,Anthony W,"This was a great way to get a little feeling for Cuba, we loved the food, music and the people! Enjoyed walking around, seeing the different shops, the coffee was very powerful but good.We signed up for the tour at the Bahia Mar, who arranged for us to be picked up at the hotel, that's the best way to go!"
Must do when in Miami,September 2019,40,Little Havana,sylvia642016,This is one of those things that's a must do when in Miami if only to get some insight into the Cuban influence on music and lifestyle in this part of the US. The area isn't very big but there's a nice buzz around the place.
Free loop service ,June 2019,50,Miami Trolley,dyhx,"It covers most places within South Beach and a little further out. Best option to hide from the heat. A full loop will take an hour or more but if you have nothing to do anyway, it's a pretty good way to sightsee and do your own hop-off-hop-on, for free! "
Free,July 2019,50,Miami Trolley,Fromeverywhere,"The trolley will take you up and down Washington Avenue. It might get crowded depending on the time of day and around some stops, but worth to take it since it's free. Sometimes you might have to wait a long time for it, as long as you consider that, it's worth it."
Great way to see South Beach areas,July 2019,50,Miami Trolley,jpeds,We were staying at the south end of South Beach and used the trolley to get around seeing parts we wouldn't have otherwise.  Its so easy to jump on and off and with the different routes you can move further north.
Free hop-on hop off,March 2019,40,Miami Trolley,John W,Note:  Wooden seats with no padding.
Free ride guys,August 2019,50,Miami Trolley,cocob843,"The staff of the trolley are very helpful and friendly. Great service for free, I recommend it! It’s makes me save a lot of money in the city of Miami (all is expensive..) "
Window Shopping At It's Best,November 2017,40,Britto Central,Patty R,So colorful!   This is the kind of place I love to just look around.   It's full of fantastic bits of artwork.   
"Bright, Light and Happy",May 2018,40,Britto Central,NauticalVoyager,"I love Bitto's work and as such made a special trip to the gallery. There are actually two galleries very close together. The art pieces are nicely displayed and the attendants are helpful and love giving anecdotes about the artist. The prices match his popularity but at the second gallery (closer to S Beach) there is a selection of more reasonable ""mass produced"" items."
BRITTO!,May 2018,50,Britto Central,anthonycox25,Had a great time at both stores ..hannah/oscar/eduaro treated us superbly hope to see you again...ANTHONY and TAMMY - the very wet guys form the UK !
This a Happy place,September 2017,50,Britto Central,ncolon60,We went to the gallery right after being on a 7 day cruise with Carnival. We met Dawn who is such a joy to work with and just to be around. Dawn treated me and my wife like royalty and we bought a painting. A few doors down is Britto Central where you can find most things by the man himself. We love Britto's art and opther works 
Not my style,June 2018,30,Britto Central,kboom70,I found the store to be a little over-rates. Not really impressed by these pop of colors and abstract creations.  Obviously there are fans but not my cup of tea. Also security men in store are rude.
Wonderful!,August 2017,50,Bal Harbour Beach,travelkai3,The beaches here are wonderful and clean. We were there in August! We live in Los Angeles where the water is always cold and strong waves. My kids loved this water and it was warm and easy to swim in!
"Relaxation, Relaxation, Relaxation is all I can can say",September 2017,50,Bal Harbour Beach,172dariens,We hung out on the beach a few days a enjoyed the cool breeze coming from the ocean waves. We also enjoyed the bike rentals and cool ride up and down the ocean strip
Great beach,November 2017,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Mo M,The beach here is very pretty. Its not so crowed so you can realx. You can go with your family and have a great time.
Pretty beach and habour,December 2017,50,Bal Harbour Beach,Saul89,"Saw some awesom fish and had alot pictures, in the summer i belive you can rent bikes tooo"
Worth the visit - free on Friday nights,March 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,MNPHL,"Great collection of Art Deco-era objects and furnishings that wonderfully convey the unique characteristics of this period. Learned a lot, and recommend this gem of a museum"
A very worthwhile visit,April 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Peter M,The Wolfsonian is a very interesting small museum which provides a very enlightened study of deco which is especially relevant given the fantastic deco preservation of the surrounding historic area of Miami Beach.
Worth a visit,March 2019,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,michele49johns,"This gem of a museum features decorative arts with a focus on Art Deco.  Just steps from South Beach, it’s a good way to be out of the sun and absorb some of Miami’s culture!"
Don't miss this hidden gem,May 2018,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Liskeenan,I almost had this free museum to myself. It is an amazing collection including the famous stained glass by Harry Clarke.
Interesting design museum focusing on Art Deco,April 2019,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,utfiero,"Focus is on Art Deco design and global contributions leading to and contributing to that design movement. Exhibits were well-curated, nicely displayed and generally engaging. One floor focused on Italian textiles, and that floor was the least appealing; perhaps the textile exhibit was “filler”? Apart from the textile exhibit, we were truly impressed and recommend the Wolfsonium. Highlights included fine period examples of furniture from around the world and various preserved architectural elements from period buildings."
OK,July 2017,30,Fisher Island,LynnM112017,"You can go there only by ferry and must be invited by someone who lives on the island.While there its nothing special but condos from 70s,nice green space and that's it.It's very boring "
Getting to Fisher Island is not just by ferry.,June 2017,50,Fisher Island,bigjohnv,"There is a private heliport there, I've used it several times when my family and I visited the hotel. Granted it is expensive for the average person but well worth using to get there without having the hassle going through security at the ferry terminal. We were met by hotel staff at the heliport and shuffled off to our hotel room and a much needed vacation."
Great Private Island with lots to do,September 2017,50,Fisher Island,REED583,You must either be a hotel guest or guest of a resident to visit this Island with the rich and famous. You can only travel there by boat or ferry (n which your car drives onto )
You must know someone who lives here or have a reservation at the hotel or spa to even step foot here,August 2017,50,Fisher Island,shayshay321,"If you do, it is a lovely departure from South Beach."
Drive by,December 2017,30,Fisher Island,lucycan,"We took a boat tour and went around the island.  Looks boring to us, mostly for old rich folks, but I think thats the point.  Well manicured from the water.  We are told property starts about $3m.  Must take a ferry here.  No roads."
This lion cub was forced to engage when it was very hot and bothered.,September 2019,10,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Jodie B,I barely touched or engaged with the cub and was not offered another experience.
Limbani,October 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,p_d_wright5050,One of the best experiences I have ever had. Limbani grabbed my hand and climbed up on to my shoulders as soon as I walked up to him. I can’t wait to come back. Thank you ZWF!!
Lion Cub Encounter,September 2019,30,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,135MaxT,"Our handsome guide, Tyler, had great energy, was very informative and took some great photos and video of our encounter."
Amazing experience,September 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Danica M,"We booked chimpanzee encounter which was memorable and white tiger was nice but I recommend chimpanzee more definitely, tiger is only good for pictures but he’s not really playful. The staff was friendly and gave us a information about all the animals and they let us feed them. This is one of a kind experience this is a must see place if you ever visit Florida you should definitely check them out."
Limbani!,October 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Mary L,4th visit!  Always fabulous!  We enjoy the visit and respect the work that is done with the animals.  Limbani is fabulous!
Awesome,December 2018,50,Art Basel,BigoBoca,Been coming here for well over a decade. It’s a phenomenon that shouldn’t be missed. Great Art &  Pretty People in a rebuilt setting. Wow!
Art Basel,December 2018,50,Art Basel,Velasquez M,Excellent place to discover new artists and revisit some old known. There are additional attractions around.  Great event
The best art fair,December 2018,40,Art Basel,Christian G,Art Basel is the best of the art fairs - but for a European it is little boring and commercial. Go with Uber there
"Art Basel, Miami Beach",December 2018,20,Art Basel,thebozorules,We found Art Miami and the other venues much more interesting than the convention center art.  Blah blah blah blah
a must if you are an artist or like tone one,January 2019,50,Art Basel,Michael L,imported from Basel Switzerland this art show is awesome   
On 3rd floor of building ,April 2019,20,David Castillo Gallery,StephenCr0ss,Strange place for a gallery. It’s not open on public holiday and you would never find this without full address. Not recommended. 
Interesting and Off the Main Track,October 2019,40,The Betsy Orb,TheDealBeans,"We came across The Betsy Orb while wandering around Collins Avenue/Ocean Drive area. Suprisingly it is not on Trip Advisor. Install in 2016 as a public work of art connecting two hotels of architectural importance, The Betsy Ross and The Carlton. This is a fun piece of art work."
It's a Target Store,October 2019,30,Target,TheDealBeans,"It's a Target Store, there's not much more to say that that, it sells the usual supermarket goods. Not really something I would normally expect to see on Trip Advisor. But, Hey Ho."
A letdown,February 2019,20,Art Deco Museum,joseph34,"This is a bit of a letdown, although the permanent exhibition gives a good-enough overview of Art Deco in Miami Beach to be able to appreciate the architecture as you stroll down the street. It is a very small museum that displays a lot of maps, artifacts and photos, but is short on context. The gift shop is more like a Miami Beach souvenir shop and less like a museum gift shop. It's very short on Art Deco."
Amazing Even If You Are Not a Fan of Modern Art,March 2017,50,de la Cruz Collection,HistoryLover2017,"This is an amazing place and when you walk among all of the art - on 3 floors - you will feel everywhere all of the love and devotion that has gone into collecting, arranging and maintaining this space.  The story of the De La Cruz' is unique and few people would do what they have done.  Also, the staff is wonderful as well and very interested in your experience at the space.  Even if you are not a fan of modern art you will come away with a new respect for what is happening in the art world when it comes to this art.  Please visit whether you love art or not.  You will not regret it!  Our guide Daniel was extremely knowlegable and shared many stories about the collection, the De La Cruz family and the background of many artists as well as what's going on currently in the art world with respect to specific artists represented in the collection.  Also many stories about putting art in this space!"
Not much,March 2016,10,Bay of Pigs Museum,UserJohnN,Not set up for tourists.
A fascinating link to the past,May 2016,50,Bay of Pigs Museum,Guerriere,Where else does one have a chance to spend one on one time with actual participants in the Bay of Pigs invasion?  Our amazing guide had been captured by the Cubans during the invasion and spent two years in a Cuban jail.  I would recommend this visit to anyone.  Admission is by donation and parking is easy and free.
Dude it's free,December 2016,50,Bay of Pigs Museum,Dennis C,Place is small. Has clean bathrooms. It's free but you can make donations. It's laid back. There's parking on the street. There's also a lot next to it and I did the New York thing and parked there.  The museum is a few blocks from where all the main action is and located off 8th street by one block.
NICE PLACE TO VISIT,November 2015,40,Coral Gables City Hall,Ramon G,coral gables city hall is a small but unique building. it has a colonial style. good area to walk around and do something different in miami. you should visit it if you are in that zone
A treasure !,November 2015,50,de la Cruz Collection,jeanpierref879,We will come back when we do not disturb them setting up their works for the great event.
Great history lesson,August 2013,40,Bay of Pigs Museum,LarryO302,"If you are looking for some intersting historical refresher on the Bay of Pigs invasion, visit this little museum. It's a tribute to the soldiers who were part of this historic invasion. "
Specific and quaint museum,September 2013,30,Bay of Pigs Museum,foxsmjr,"The museum is dedicated to the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba.  The exhibit inside consists of mostly photographs of the many people who fought, and artifacts, new paper clippings, and magazines covering the event.  It is small but interesting.  There also seems to be a community center gathering hall inside, the people inside were very friendly and welcoming."
Bay of betrayal,December 2013,30,Bay of Pigs Museum,Continent8,We visited this small Museum in Little Havana in early December. It may look closed but it is probably open----a buzzer will unlock the door for you.  Few artifacts remain from a disaster where everyone is either killed or captured from a country that we have not recognized for over fifty years. It is a small wonder that few things are displayed. The staff took a dim view of John Kennedy. Hard to blame them. They had trained to go in through a small town with dock facilities. Kennedy changed their destination to a swamp with only one or two roads out that could be easily defended-----changed it within 36 hours of the invasion!!!   After the first wave hist the beaches Kennedy also decided to cancel air cover. It was suicide and sure defeat. If anything this museum explains those things.
Small Museum that shows to the world that Kennedy sent these men and left them to die,February 2014,40,Bay of Pigs Museum,90pedroc,"Sad bit of our history in which we sent a brigade of men trained by the CIA, into Cuba, they were supposed to land in another part of Cuba, but at the last minute it was changed, also they forego the air support and over 50,000 Cuban troops waited for them in shore, it is one of the biggest debacles that our Country has made by endangering these men's lives, which only a few made it through. Sad"
Awsome experience at Jesse's ranch.,August 2014,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,brtfrce,Awesome experience at Jesse's ranch. Haven't rode a horse for a long time and needed to get some of the rust off. After a tour of his mini zoo with all types of exotic animals Jesse put me on his personal horse and gave a thorough riding lesson. Many thanx Jesse.
Very poor,December 2016,20,Santa's Enchanted Forest,keithrX5690GI,Very expensive.... over 40$ per person... while still having to purchase everything inside....nothing less than 5$ .... having small kids being the majority of the population and SMOKING is rampant at the venue..... very poor 
Fun for all!,November 2016,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,JRG F,"I went because I had a free kids admission with adult ticket. Food vendors offer a nice variety, so many rides. Go earlier and the line is not long at all. Gr8 way to spend time with your family over the holidays. Drove over an hour to this event, and it was worth it!"
Overpriced and Run Down Carnival,December 2016,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,travelfam2015,"FOOD- Terrible. It is greasy and overpriced. The food stands inside the park (past the entrance) are cheaper than the food stands at the entrance offering the same things- go figure. Thankfully we had dinner before we got to the park, saving us money and potential tummy aches :-("
You can light the night away here,December 2016,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,thej0nes3, across the street and eat before you enter.
"Overpriced, dirty carnival",December 2016,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,wendaylou2,"A ticket (with coupon) is around $30 for what feels like should be a free or max $5 county carnival. There are a few nice light displays near the park entrance and the rest of the park is vendors selling fair food or outdated, weird displays and carnival games. Didn't even want to use the restroom here as they only have port-a-potties and give you hand sanitizer on the way out since there's no sinks-blegh."
Very happy at Jessie's Ranch,March 2014,40,Jesse Williams Ranch,Cynthia S,We were at Jesse Williams Ranch.  It was our first time at the ranch.  Jessie treated us wonderfully and made us feel right at home.  He took my 2 girls around the whole ranch and taught them about the horses and gently showed them how to ride them.  It was a wonderful experience overall.  Beautiful horses!
Kennedy Park is great for travelling Runners!,April 2012,50,Kennedy Park,Tim B,Early morning and late evening would be advisable as there isn't much shade and it gets pretty warm and humid. (especially so if you're from England).
Nice for a walk.,May 2013,50,Kennedy Park,Carla Q,I like to go for a walk here. The view of the bay relax and inspires. Also there is a kids playground that is really nice. There is also a fenced space for dogs. Also the best frozen lemonade is sold there.
Super Stay,December 2015,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Heidi O,I had the privilege to stay at the fair for 2 weeks as my son worked for one of the Carnivals at the time.  It was an awesome experience from a South African point of view. Didn't do the rides but loved the entertainment and tried different food every night and they were good. This is a must add to your to do list when visiting Miami over the holidays.
Santa Anyone??!!,December 2015,50,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Loucious,Miami's Own piece of the North Pole! Come and enjoy this Winter Wonderland in our own backyard! Plenty of rides to keep all ages entertained & plenty of food to cover all taste buds! (A little pricey!) 
Scam,November 2016,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Shekou_1,Total over priced - entrance should be like 5 bucks like a state fair - all the same overpriced food drinks and sketchy rides and scary people. Avoid!!!
The Kids Enjoyed It/Nostalgic ,November 2016,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Mahisa H,"4. Parking can get far. If you can pay to get a ride to the gate. Runs $2-6 per person (going it cost is $15 for the four of us, then $24 to go back to the car). There is also a train that runs for $1 per person."
Santas enchanted forest NOT a safe place ,November 2016,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Melanie Marie F,Please share. Want to make sure people understand that these rides are not safe. It could happen to your child!
Unforgettable day!,September 2013,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Pauly W,Any family or group looking to enjoy a beautiful day can not pick a better place to go!
Excellent place to spent a few hours and great hospitality .,October 2013,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Cuquiypiru,"We spent around 3 hrs on a Saturday with my mentally challenge sister and she spent the most beautiful time ridding ""her"" horse Shalom and bathing and feeding him and the special attention to her by the owner Jesse was beautiful . We strongly recommend the place. Than you to Jesse"
Best place to be on Saturday,January 2012,50,Coral Gables City Hall,holidayhelpToronto,"The Coral Gables Farmers Market is held at City Hall on Saturday and is by far the best market I have attended in Florida.  In addition to vendors, there is a cooking demo by a local restaurant, garden tips and childrens activities"
Wonderful Spanish arquitecture,November 2011,50,Coral Gables City Hall,olivermia,The building it a beautyfull place In the hart of coral gables .
Delightful.,April 2016,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,tnknitter,"Park on the street or in the lot across from the entrance ($6 flat fee), then stroll down the shady walkway.  If you just need a break, the walkway and restrooms are outside of the fee box, but even the stroll is worth the $2 admission fee.  The tour was also inexpensive at a mere $3 - rare for the area - and very interesting.  The ranger was able to answer all the questions our small group asked of him.  I also liked that the background of the family and the property were delivered as we were comfortably seated on the porch, and that we were allowed to spend ample time examining items and areas of the house.  I went knowing virtually nothing of Florida history, and left with an appreciation for what it took to carve a homestead out of the wilderness only a century ago. Highly recommend."
"Crowded, tacky, expensive.",December 2015,20,Santa's Enchanted Forest,wunderwoman,"That about sums it up! The spectacle and cheesy light displays could be fun, as would gorging on carnival food if that's your thing, but for the ridiculous admission price. The rides scare me for all the wrong reasons. "
Srange ness at Christmas,December 2015,50,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Susan G,"If you like to be surrounded by carnival workers and tramps in a seedy run down atmosphere, full of sugary, greasy indigestable food and un-predictable rides Then you will love Santa's Enchanted Forest"
Expensive,December 2015,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Nelson F,"This place is getting too expensive to go.  Some of the things are looking a little worn.  I do appreciate some of the shows they have, but very difficult to see them.  If they had seating with better viewing it would make a huge difference.  Basically, you have to stand and try to see the show through the crowds.  There are activities you have to pay extra to do, that perhaps should be included as part of the entrance fee.  There are large crowds."
Ok place but they need to reinvest in new displays etc,December 2015,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Isabel N,Same old weathered displays. They need to re invest to freshen up the look. Gets way over crowded and rides are scary old too.
Go every year,December 2015,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Adriana E,"Its like the fair, just with tons of beautiful lights. It's something to do  while waiting for the youth fair to come again a few months later.  "
Good local history,November 2013,40,Coral Gables Museum,MysteriousIslander,This is a great museum in a historic building right in downtown Coral Gables. While the museum is a bit light on physical objects/actual artifacts the exhibits are still very engaging and informative. Imaginative use of space and some very creative presentation. We really enjoyed our visit. Do take a moment to explore the spectacular reliefs on the building's exterior and the unique neo-Mediterranean architecture of the neighborhood as a whole.
Great clean beach,March 2017,50,Surfside Beach,TonyO1717,Walk on beach or adjacent walkway. Can walk from Bal-Harbour to South Beach - long walk.
Satisfy your sweet treat & shopping cravings,August 2015,40,CocoWalk,MissBonafide,"Loved that CocoWalk was a short but scenic walk/drive from the Ritz-Carlton and it became my 'go to' spot. There are some really nice Restaurants such as Bice Bistro, The Cheesecake Factory & Duffy's Sports Grill etc. A very cool open Bar concept - Fat Tuesday and even a Theatre - Cinepolis. But overall I was super elated to satisfy my sweet treat & shopping cravings with my two loves….Starbucks & Victoria’s Secret. The Beauty Store is separate and right across from VS, and yes there are plenty options galore. Parking is quite expensive especially on the weekends, so in order to make it worthwhile plan for the day. You can also explore other Stores & Restaurants in the surrounding area."
Unspectacular Shopping Venue,August 2015,30,CocoWalk,josephw203,"An open air shopping arcade, located in Coconut Grove.  The guide books point it out as a good spot to visit, but it seemed quite ordinary when we were there on a Monday. Many shops not open and some just plain vacant. It may have been a destination at some time earlier, but would not be worth going out of your way, now."
No reason to go there,September 2015,20,CocoWalk,AnnaAndPetro,The place is very small. It has very few stores. Not interesting. It is nothing worth going out of your way for.
Pleasant place,February 2016,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,814RobertS,"Parking can be a real issue. There is no park parking, and parking can be very difficult and expensive on weekends or other busy times. Coconut Grove does have a vibe all its own."
First and last time going!!,January 2016,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,m0m007,"Worst experience ever!!!! Spend close to $100 on the entry to the worst place on earth. Not only did I experience animal abuse but also the people attending this place were horrible. I had ""adults"" pushing my kids out of the lines, and verbally abusing me for defending my kids. No security or police anywhere around, which makes this place not only horrible but unsafe too. Never going back!!!!"
Christmas Family FUN!,December 2015,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Dominique D,"Went Christmas night with a group of 15. It had been over 15 years since I went. It was crowded and packed to capacity. However, the children and I had lots of fun. Be prepared to spend lots of money of admission and food. It was worth it to see the smile on the kids faces. SAVE up throughout the year to be better prepared."
Amazing,December 2015,50,Santa's Enchanted Forest,IslanderJT,"My partner and I came here last weekend. It was a GREAT experience, we had so much fun that night! We will definitely be checking this out again!"
not worth visiting,December 2015,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Norberto N,"Went and the admission price is $30.00 per person. We found the food prices to high as a chicken shish kabob with four little pieces was $8.00 and bottled water was $3.00. It's geared more for children and don't recommend it for adults, unless you are accompanying children. The crowd control is terrible as their is insufficient security or police. WE were heading to another area within the attraction and ran into a massive crowd (horde) of people enter the attraction and they we pushing. I was heading in the opposite direction and was almost trampled. Their were children who were being pushed and toddlers in carriages who almost got injured. It took me over twenty minutes to walk to where I was heading which was a distance of only about 60 feet. I then ran into another area further away an once again it happened again and this time it took over thirty minutes to walk about 100 feet. I informed a security personnel an they only asked ""is someone fighting or injured."" I told them that they needed to get there soon as someone may get injured and a fight may erupt soon due to the given situation. they said ""we'll be there soon."" and took their time. Another lady had a target shopping cart as she headed into the crowd of people. You have been forewarned."
Same stuff every year,December 2015,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,S S,They have the same things every year and seems like the prices are going up high every time. It is a fun place to go and the rides are good but a little more variety would help. Last time I went was two years ago and this year I found the same exact things than when I was a kid. 
Pleasantly surprised.,October 2012,40,Coral Gables Museum,TheNank,As the title suggests was more interesting than I had anticipated. They are constantly changing out exhibits with topics related to local history and concerns like the environment and sustainability. The museum itself is a great example of historical preservation in the gables!!!!
Great for History Buffs,July 2012,40,Coral Gables Museum,LawrenceEB,"A nice little museum replete with exhibits illustrating the colorful history of Coral Gables.It is free, has a nice gift shop. Worth a visit.."
Hiking the biking trIls.,August 2013,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,GassonG,"Dont miss this oppertunity to enjoy 3 plus mils of hiking, just have to look back every so often for bikers. 1.75 to enter Key Biscayne & 6.00 to enter the trails. Well worth it. Best trail to hike Highway to hell. More elevation than you might think. Start out following the trail signs and always take the more difficult trails when asked. The trail is a loop back to the parking.You wont be sorry this is the best in Miami.mwhen done head over to Wiskey Joe's for a cold one."
Small shopping mall with restaurants and cinema complex,January 2015,30,CocoWalk,621simond,"Very nicely presented and gets busy with locals beacuse of the cinema complex.  Not worth a vsit on it's own, only if you are going to see a film or are staying nearby."
Great shopping and restaurants,February 2015,50,CocoWalk,T L,TK's restaurant is so charming and everyone is so nice and friendly.
What you see in top pictures is what you get!,August 2014,10,CocoWalk,4Runners67,Not well located. Takes a lot of times to go if you take public transit (almost 2 hours from downtown miami).  We were expecting a lot more. It's really a tourist trap. Not that much stores. We have made the tour in less than 15 minutes. There is nothing else to say about it.
I No Longer Understand How this Place is Open,January 2015,20,CocoWalk,Apryl P,"Also, the movie theater is by no means a luxury experience. For their prices, I might as well go to Sunset Place, have a few drinks at Splitsville or Buffalo Wild Wings, and THEN go to my movie. Holding a tiny bottle of wine in my hand doesn't make the experience luxurious... it only puts on the alcohol goggles"
Peace & Quiet,February 2015,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,Mel_Medd,"The Barnacle is a historic home built in 1891.  It was home to Ralph Middleton Munroe, one of Coconut Grove's most influential pioneers. The home offers a glimpse of life, when all travel to and from Miami was by boat. Munroe sought to preserve the forest on his land, and cut out a small trail through the hammock, barely wide enough for one vehicle. Today, the property contains many large, old trees.  The home is left in its natural state, and appears much as it did in Munroe's days. The Barnacle is a great place to enjoy a picnic on the lawn, a tour through the hammocks, rocking in the chairs in the front porch, or a family night at one of their shows.  Watch the sailboats go by and take a picnic basket.  This site is definitely for the history buffs and peace and quiet seekers. I come here with my boyfriend and roam around. It is very peaceful. We take a blanket with some food and some wine and just chill while taking photos of the historic home. Cute getaway."
Interesting historical site,August 2014,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,businesstraveler05,"Nice little park like setting.  Great old house to tour, with a good guide.  No AC so don't go on a really hot day."
Park employees so rude!!!!,December 2015,20,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Michelle S,"Our family's first time at the park. We drove 2 hrs to take our son for his birthday. Upon entering a young man convinced us to buy express passes, he said the park was packed. By the time we reached the rides we realized the lines were very short and to make matters worse our 9 yr old bday boy aw sent tall enough to get on most of the fun rides. We immediately found the young man to ask for a refund or at the very least to refund two passes so my husband and older one could ride while my son and I played games. Not only did he refuse which I could live with but this kid named ISAIAH claimed to be the owner. Later his girlfriend who also works there Told us he was the owners son. He was SO rude and condescending. I literally had to back up a few steps because he was in my face. I couldn't believe the way he treated me and spoke to me especially in front of my children! Needless to say it put a big damper on our night. If in fact he is the owners son it leaves a lot to say about how they feel about the family's that visit their park. Never going back!"
the churro woman,December 2015,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,leonadezion,"this was the first time taking my son there, he was so exited about the park without really knowing what he was going to find in the park. We had a great time at the park, he enjoy the rides so much, he was absolutely  happy until we went to get some churros ( from the woman close to the dropping tower) and she decided to critized my son (7 years old) because he have long curly hair, she was really evil and disrespectful with us, to the point of almost ruin our magical night. I really dont think you should have people like this working there, because she wasnt just making a 7 years old kid feel bad, she also was racist and lets be honest; the park is not cheap and its not nice to pay all that money to have a great time and someone coming to critic your kid and making him feel bad. i dont know what are you going to do about it, maybe for you is not important but i think that at least you should talk to her and teach her how to treat customers and kids, and apologized to us."
"Santa's is fun, but needs some freshening up",December 2015,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,CarolineZ251,"To echo something another post said, we were really saddened to see the animals captive in small cages and tanks, it is really cruel to keep them there over such a long period of time just for entertainment purposes."
13 hour drive and worth it!,February 2013,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,etherealgang,"Traveled here from NC for the Virginia Key Grassroots Festival of Music and Dance! Camped on the beach for several days and I must say it was very enjoyable! The attendants were pleasant, the landscape and groundskeeping was great, and the park was beautiful! And I'd like to add, for someone who loves showering, the bath house here was quite comfortable, HOT water and a friendly attendant! There are raccoons on the island that like to come out at night and crocodiles. I never personally encountered one of the two except for from afar. If you are camping, don't leave food out in the tent or you may find a creature or two joining you in the tent. But, the beaches are quiet and the view of the Miami skyline, especially at night is a must-see. Two Thumbs Up! I'll be back!"
Best Time Ever!!,December 2015,50,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Leslie L,"Every year we find something new that has been added to the park.  This time was no different we got to meet and feed Czar the 8 week old baby tiger.  The rides are always exciting and fun.  The food is not too bad for carnival food.  We go every year and will continue to do so.  The park is a time honored tradition in our family, we absolutely love it!"
Shopping or Watching,June 2014,50,CocoWalk,Jorge P,"Greatest spot ever to relax and ""people watch"".  Lots of activity here all the time and very casual.  See if you can spot any ""famous"" locals.  Perhaps even some superstars.  Stallone was ther this day.  He sold his Miami home but must have been back visiting friends."
Over Rated,June 2014,20,CocoWalk,Randy413,"Our Hotel advised we visit , we did buy Sunglasses there . This place is over rated because there is not enough there . The parking is the highest I paid in Miami ."
Not much to see or do...,August 2014,20,CocoWalk,Sabriniex,Very few shops and not much else to do here. Don't bother making the trip from Vizcaya like we did. The bay is quite a long walk away.
Just ok,August 2014,30,CocoWalk,kate3111,"Not much to do or see here? Was expecting more , place seems v quiet , very little shops , didn't stay here very long as we found that there wasn't that much to do "
"Has seen better days, not worth the trip",July 2014,20,CocoWalk,Gregor W,"if you are staying in Miami, don't bother to go all the way to Coconut Grove and the Cocowalk; I remember it from about 15 years ago, when there was life and a lot of atmosphere. I looks deserted and run down, almost all the good shops are gone;"
Fun times,January 2014,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,John B,It's a great evening of music and having a good time with friends. We go to almost all of the Friday night concerts.
Enjoyed this lovely quiet place in Coconut Grove.,March 2014,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,jane j,"Spending a holiday in Miami and staying in Coconut Grove, we found this lovely place. Passed the entrance while walking home from a restaurant and read about it, so went the next morning. Lush vegetation as you walk down to the main house, lots of little lizards scuttling about, some beautiful trees to be seen. The house tours were not available on our visit, but did not matter. Passing the house, the grounds lead down to the sea. Moored on a small pontoon is the lovely little yacht  Egret, which is a copy of a yacht designed by Ralph Munroe, who's property and land this once was. We sat on a bench and enjoyed the cool sea air and loved it all, so relaxing. Went back up to the house and sat on the rocking chairs, could have stayed there all day. There is information about the house and Munroe, who was a prolific figure in Coconut Grove, and indeed a leading yacht designer and founder of a major yacht club. Have researched more since getting home and is all very interesting, especially if you are a boat lover. Many events take place here , including concerts, yoga sessions and it can be hired for private occasions. We were so glad that we didn't miss out on this lovely place. Don't forget to put your entrance fee in the honesty box, a real bargain at 2$ per person."
Wholesome Family Fun,December 2014,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,robbar13,"It was a fun time, lines weren't too long and the park greatly accommodated everyone. I'm looking forward to being able to attend again very soon."
Great holiday atmosphere ,December 2014,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,rmmc07,"Rides, games and amusement park foods abound. The kids loved the rides and the shows and played more than an few games.  Make an fun evening for the whole family out of it.  It will not disappoint.  Kids were ages 9-11. They dragged the adults on more than a few rides."
Only worth checking out once,November 2015,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,tejojo,"To summarize, Santa's Enchanted Forest is an alright experience. It's a bit of a stretch to call this fair a ""theme park"", let alone a ""Christmas theme park"", but if fairs are your sort of thing, find a discount and go for it! For me, it was only worth checking out once."
Bring some cash,November 2015,20,Santa's Enchanted Forest,chad e,Everything looked like it was old and run down. It was kid of dirty and the makeshift bathrooms with people trying to get tips were weird. It's $35 or so to get in and it's only kind of worth it if you plan on riding a lot of rides. The food vendors looked gross. We didn't eat anything. It wasn't very enjoyable at all.  Gave it 2 stars because my wife loves Christmas and anything christmas and she's happy so at least she kind of enjoyed it.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas in Miami !,November 2015,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Keleko Q,"This is how the eastern portion of Tropical Park turns into starting about after Halloween. It's been a landmark there in the corner of Palmetto Expressway and Bird Road every year. Believe it or not , there seem more people there if the temperature drops below 70 degrees at night. Maybe because Miamians or not get to wear their special get-up for the season instead of the usual tropical wardrobe. But this place is a total fun with all the lights, music, rides, food and etc. "
Still Lovely,March 2014,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,Dawn-ohbehave,"I used to be a ""Grove"" local, but moved to Broward in 2000. When I lived there, I visited the Barnacle often. It's been years since I have been there and I'm delighted to report that this is still a must see historic landmark if you are visiting Coconut Grove. The property is perfectly maintained and I loved the recent addition of the gift shop.   We arrived too late for a tour, but there are so many stories to be told about Commodore Munroe and this property, it's worth taking, just to hear about the amazing history.  Katrina, welcomed us at the gift shop and gave us all kinds of updates on current events and celebrations at the park.  Local or not, the Barnacle will take you back in time. If you are a local, you may want to have a talk with your city commissioners about the homeless encampment at the gate. It's not particularly welcoming to tourists. "
Must see place in Miami Cocowalk !,October 2013,50,CocoWalk,clover1970,"Bohemian area , the open air mall is a bit small but nice shops , the ambiance is worth for a visit , we drived through Coconut Grove to reach this place , Coconut Grove is a very nice residential area ."
Eating and Shopping,November 2013,40,CocoWalk,jmartibOswego_NY,"While staying at a nearby hotel, we were told about Cocowalk and decided to take the ten minute walk to have an early dinner. It turned out to be a unique open air shopping and dining area although not a large one. There are several dining options to include a large Cheesecake Factory which is very poplar. Also there is a movie theater with 13 different screens. If you drive to Cocowalk, parking is available in garages but I would check the Cocowalk website to see the rates first. Some of the businesses will validate but remember, this appears to be a non cash payment system."
One of the things to see in Coconut Grove,November 2013,30,CocoWalk,Tanmouss,"It is a mall with an interesting architecture, and a few shops and restaurants. This place is quite animated same as the streets surrounding it. Visit as well Funnel st a very short street with interesting shops facing Cocowalk."
With all the outdoor malls….,December 2013,20,CocoWalk,CaraMHutchins,"I wouldn't waste my time making my way back here.  The shops are low end and there isn't that much to see.  The restaurants are mostly chains and you have to pay for parking.  We went there once at night and everything was closed but the restaurants.  When we went back in the daytime, the place was more lively."
Outdoor mall but do not rush,January 2014,30,CocoWalk,manunited45,This was just an average outdoor mall so do not waste yur time. Five minutes to walk through. Similar to many such places everywhere and nothing unique.
"A bit of construction, but doesn't spoil the beach",May 2016,40,Surfside Beach,Laesning,Much more relaxing and a completely different attitude to further south.
small park with an old home/museum to visit,September 2012,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,Graceloves2travel,"The area is located in Coconut Grove and you can see the museum/home of a pioneer in our area Monroe' old home ,the park itself is small but nice and is on the water,after this visit you can walk to the Grove and eat at many restaurants in the area"
Poor crowd planning and long long lines ...not worth the $30 entrance fee,January 2015,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Eileen P,"First timer to the park and I paid $121.00 for 3 adult tickets and 1 child ticket. Myself wasnt riding I was just along to take care of my baby nephew whose 6 months old so my niece and husband could ride with my other nephew whose 4. Took them 60 minutes in line to just ride the Ferris wheel. Disturbing that they were allowing just one person a car in the Ferris wheel but I guess anything goes. People were cutting in line ahead of others who had been waiting and I noticed sharing of fast passes like u wouldn't believe. Lack of security is another concern. I witnessed 2 Miami dade police officers stand at a hot dog vendor spot for 90 minutes just talking. Where's the security in that? In the 4 hours we spent there my nephew rode 4 rides. Waste of money, time and effort!"
nice but bring your wallet,December 2014,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,kimkimco,"all in all, if you can get past how much things cost you will have fun"
it's still miami's winter wonderland,December 2014,50,Santa's Enchanted Forest,luvtiedye,"it's been a few years since my last review/confession....the confession is that we never get tired of the fun rides, games, shows, food (they even have 'on the healthier side' choices).  my teenaged girls and my husband still have a blast riding the roller coasters and those rides that could make you wonder if your upside down or not!  i have a great time watching them.   there are new displays every year placed along the sides down the entrance to the rides, shows, and vendors that are fun to watch and very colorful.  several are kid and family friendly, to take pictures in.  looking forward to see what will be new next season!"
A visit,October 2014,50,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Peter1941,This was so amazing and we spent so long there enjoying the sights and lights. A treat for adults as well as children.You nned transport to nget there as no taxis available when you leaveb
Save your money ,October 2014,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,ms305gee,"It was disorganized (although I bought tickets in advance on line) the wait to get in was about 30 min. The rides were outdated as were the stuffed animals displayed. Overcrowded and the food was terrible ! We paid $130 or so to go in and left in an hour. My kids 8 and 9 years old asked why would you bring us here ?!! I'll never waste my time or money on visiting Santas , again. Terrible experience ! "
nothing to see.,June 2013,20,Barnacle State Historic Site,MiamiFL2011,"If you went to eat across the street, drank too much and wanted to burn off the buzz then it will work."
Beautiful Quiet Beach,January 2016,40,Surfside Beach,SalGold,Nice quiet beach--alternative to South Beach perhaps.  Potential parking challenges but definitely no greater than South Beach.
Nice place to hangout,December 2012,30,CocoWalk,mapegp,"Went with my son to Cocowalk, nice place to spend an afternoon, being a weekday it was almost empty, nice stores and places to have drinks or lunch/dinner. On weekends is very lively, full of people of all ages, especially college students from nearby University of Miami."
Walked through...,May 2013,50,CocoWalk,kingshahid,"We walked through the cocowalk which was very nice (I cant rate it as a shopping center since I didn't travel through this area for specifically shopping). I recommend you take the walk through here, we ate at Chilis which is on the rooftop. There are quite a few options to eat here. With Starbucks located on the ground level and parking easily accessible."
Not worth it,April 2013,20,CocoWalk,TTP538,"Very few stores were open when we visited, it looked like the area had seen better days.  We made this part of our trip so that we could visit the Jaguar restaurant, which is definitely a diamond in the rough so to speak."
Disappointing,August 2012,30,CocoWalk,baahumbug,I had missed coming here on my first visit so was really looking forward to coming here second time round. There were very few shops and it seemed quite dis jointed in layout. We had an ok meal but there really was not much here.
Lots of options,June 2013,40,CocoWalk,detrini868,Quite little boutique shops as well. 
Fabulous Surfside!,February 2016,50,Surfside Beach,EANYC,"Surfside, a small Town just south of Bal Harbour has become the toniest destination, what with the Four Seasons and Fendi residences about to open, as well as a lively dining scene on Harding Avenue"
gorgeous beach,February 2016,50,Surfside Beach,laya b,We had beautiful weather. The beach is a quieter beach very relaxing. Nice walking path goes down to miami.
"Well worth the Visit, a Great break from the city",March 2013,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,Bonhams,"It was well worth the visit, a refreshing break from the city.  A lot of history.  For only $2, you get a glance into Miami history."
Hidden Jewel,April 2013,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,songwarrior,We were looking for South Beach and we came up on this hidden treasure.  For $2 you get a walk through a lovely wooded trail with sign markers giving information along the way.  At the end of the walk is the house that goes with the park.  Check this out while in Miami.
Calle Ocho slash Redneck Rides,December 2014,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Ferdi B,"Calle Ocho people buying redneck food from them. Theres less theme rides every year for the kids, but more and more rednecks demanding more money for their traveling routine. This was beautiful back in the 90's, they should just shut this thing down. Its a waste of money and time."
"Watch out for the ""we work for tips"" bathroom people!!!!",December 2014,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Suzy O,"Well, this was our first time at Santa's Enchanted forest, we have been waiting to go for years!! It was OK, rides were good and there were plenty of food vendors.  BUT, look out for the bathroom people, they expect YOU to PAY just to use the bathroom!! It was very uncomfortable and WEIRD!!! Definitely put a bad taste in the experience!!! I didn't think I was at the Four Seasons, was I????? Anyway, the kids had fun and the lights were beautiful BUT I had expected something a little more upscale for the price and not so ""carnival feeling""... Some of the workers were definitely NOT into working there..."
Sadly Dated,December 2014,20,Santa's Enchanted Forest,MTraveler43,"Unless you are desperate  for entertainment, I would not recommend this attraction."
It's OK,December 2014,20,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Zailet,"It's ok if you live close by but It’s changed a lot thru out the years it’s more food & merchandise then lights, I lived in Miami for many years and we loved going there every season, we now live in Lake Wales and decided to take our girls so they can see how beautiful all those lights are but as we entered I notice the change and was very disappointed how they removed a lot of the Christmas display to add food & merchandise vendors."
Great for kids and adults alike,December 2014,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,NiviaM,I have been coming to this attraction every year and I love it. I love the variety of Christmas displays. The best for me this year was the Santa's mail box   To see my grandson writing a letter to Santa was priceless   The games can get a little steep but thru are ok.  Great experience   What they need are more available for restrooms 
Only worth it if you get to go inside,April 2013,20,Barnacle State Historic Site,wbullseye,"Unless you know what time the tour is, expect to waste a day if you really are intent to see this site.  It would've been nice to learn about some history, but they don't seem to care to share it with you."
Nice hidden place in Coconut Grove,June 2012,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,Miami_FloridaSandy33,"The entrance is free so it's worth it anyway if you are passing through Coconut grove. There is a sweeping view on the sea, it's great to have a picnic on the grass and the house is interesting. Lots of mosquitoes during the wet season."
Nice getaway from the hustle of the south,September 2015,50,Surfside Beach,Peter B,I like to enjoy the evening in south beach but hangout here during the day. Close to my usual hotel and near Flanigans where I enjoy eating and hanging out a lot.  The beach is also close to a publix supermarket where you can stock up on everything. Very safe relaxing beach my 2nd favorite after Siesta Beach in Sarasota.
gorgeous beach,April 2015,40,Surfside Beach,Regina G,white sand and warm water! not much for night life; very quiet and you need to rent a car to get to South Beach.
Beautiful vistas,September 2015,50,Surfside Beach,viajerodenoche,"Clean, pass through the greenbelt to get there, a tropical paradise in the city. The city treasures its beaches."
"Nice and quiet, sometimes a bit to quiet",June 2015,40,Surfside Beach,rmathijssen,"Beach is great, parking is no problem, enough space. Definitely worth a visit when you want to escape for a few hours from the crowded Miami South Beach."
Slice of Surfside,May 2015,50,Surfside Beach,Michelle R,"so here you are not quite interested in being in South Beach but yet want to have access I recommend staying in Surfside beach ,  not only will you feel relaxed there are hidden treasures that only Surfside has to offer.   "
Worth an Hour,January 2013,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,TheNank,"Is a cool piece of property right in coconut grove so if you have an hour to spare or are just strolling around is a nice leisurely walk down to the dock with bay views, don't forget your mosquito spray. "
"Nice sandy beach, even better jogging path",January 2016,40,Surfside Beach,mmrb05,"The beach is great, though watch out for jelly fish. Even better than the beach is the walking/jogging path. It makes running on vacation a breeze!"
Surfside Beach,March 2016,30,Surfside Beach,Valerie F,There is too much construction in the area.
use bug spray,May 2013,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,Collin80,"It's a short walk through the hammocks to the site, but in that short time you will be eaten alive by all the mosquitoes if you don't come prepared.  It's a nice little spot for a picnic but there's really not much to see.  The waterfront area is pretty small.  It's only a $2 donation to get in and a few more for a tour.  It's right in downtown Coconut Grove, so a good spot to get away for a short time."
Green Space in the Middle of the Grove,August 2013,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,jpseader,"Sad though on both sides of the park are condos that take away a lot of the beauty. Park only open a few days a week, think that's due to state budget cuts."
Stunning views over the sea,May 2013,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,John E,This was in the guide book but to be honest it didn't do it justice. It is very interesting if you are interested in plants or the early days of miami and the life then this is perfect for you. Stunning views over the sea when you get to the bottom of the garden.
I LOVE SURFSIDE BEACH !!!,June 2016,50,Surfside Beach,Frank d,"This place hasn't changed much since I started coming here during the 1960's. There used to be a TV Show called Surfside Six and the protagonists live on a Houseboat supposedly docked somewhere near here. I believe it was actually docked further South near the Fontainebleau Hotel. Anyway, good memories and a beautiful beach."
Clear waters and great place to spend a day or a weekend......!!!!,June 2016,50,Surfside Beach,RogSm0327,"Definitely is a great place to spend a day or a weekend  at, with plenty of restaurants, cafes and  shopping. It's a perfect beach to relax and unwind at.  "
Our Regular Spot to Go to the Beach,June 2016,40,Surfside Beach,sailboardsmiami,"No bathrooms--need to go to a local restaurant. And big buildings now create late afternoon shade.  But it is a great beach and locals hang here.  Rarely too crowded.  Some beach chair rentals. Parking is good--at post office, on road, and under the overpass."
Super Clean and Family Oriented Beach,July 2016,50,Surfside Beach,D19Racing,Super Clean.. But was given a few shark warnings by Hotel Staff and Others who were staying with us to stay far away from the Buoy. 
Even in July!,July 2014,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,digidoc,"July is HOT in Florida and I usuaully stay inside as much as possible. Our visit, while hot, was very tolerable, although a visit in Feruary would propanly be superb. We vivisited around mid-day and the visit was nice. We opted to stay for the house tour (although just touring the property is amazing). The house itself was really an innovative and inventive construction. Well worth finding out the story of RM Munroe (builder of The Barancle)!"
Nice shady park in the heart of Coconut Grove,October 2014,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,Tom P,"We lived in the area for a couple of years and we were visiting the area again with friends last week and decided to travel to Coconut Grove.  We literally stumbled upon the park by accident and decided to take the nice shady walk through Barnacle Park.  We enjoyed seeing all the lush and pristine vegetation and trees along the path which were well marked, and the further you travel along the path the sounds and vistas off the city seem to disappear.  You actually can see Florida and the hammocks they way they were back at the turn of the late 19th century.  I would highly recommend you take the time to enjoy this peaceful spot in the middle of bustling and fashionable Coconut Grove."
Tons of Seaweed but BEAUTIFUL,August 2016,50,Surfside Beach,kwasson,Nice and quiet and family friendly beach. my kids and I had a blast. The best most relaxing time to go is in the morning! 
Quiet part of the beaches,August 2016,30,Surfside Beach,andimate,"Quiet here, which is great for relaxing."
So well maintained!,August 2016,50,Surfside Beach,Marian G,"I visited during hurricane season so the rain storms came daily, night and day.  To my amazement, immediately after each storm you would see the vehicle coming out to flatten the sand right back out to perfection. I loved it!"
"Soft, sandy beach",September 2016,40,Surfside Beach,JackNJacquie,"Beach goers will find plenty of shells and sea glass....nice swimming area, no rocks!   Despite high tourist area, not overly crowded....good place for couples and or families..."
Vacation,October 2016,50,Surfside Beach,E1537QUjenniferf,Surfside beach is a nice area close to Miami. Ocean view from my room. Nice breeze off the ocean. Must pay to park at most places.
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY FUN,December 2015,50,Santa's Enchanted Forest,ruthklein,"SANTA'S ENCHANTED FOREST is is a MUST do every year for family fun.  The employees were nice and helpful and the attractions, rides and lots of thrills for everyone!"
The Barnacle is a waste of time.,July 2015,20,Barnacle State Historic Site,Rafael V,"This State Park has nothing to offer except a glimpse of how a 19th Century millionaire lived.  Given the property, it seems to me he lived a fairly boring life.   The house is average, and the park offers no activities of interest to children.  I would recommend visiting Matheson Hammock or Alice Wainright Park.  If you want to see a beautiful house go to Viscaya or Deering Estate."
A little bit of History hidden in the Grove,June 2015,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,Karen D,"Next time you are in Coconut Grove, and have a few minutes to spare, find the sign and leisurely go explore the Barnacle. A little piece of property that lets you peek into the past. The walk to the house and water is under covered trees so it is cool. The historic house is small and there is a tour if you like. If you decide to skip looking in the house it still is pleasant to see the grounds. Imagine what life was like back then in hot southern Florida. The breeze from the water must have been their best friend. A quick diversion hidden in Coconut Grove."
Lovely little park.,August 2015,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,Dan T,"Really nice short diversion from the city. Really nice gardens and house, and a fantastic view from the pier - great place for a picnic in particular! It won't take up more than an hour or so but if you are in the area it'd be a shame not to see it. "
Shopping area with some taste & style,May 2015,30,CocoWalk,MMJZ-1985,"A condensed shopping area that has many options as well as restaurants and bars close by.  Open air so be prepared but more compressed and easier to navigate than Lincoln Road (this is better) even though you might have to miss a few hyper unique brands.  Parking is available (Like really in an adjacent garage).  This is a great afternoon activity, not much tourist type stores but a nice location to shop, relax, people watch and feel safe."
A peaceful nature version of Miami Beach,December 2016,50,Surfside Beach,David T,"Here, I liked the quiet, clean, unadulterated version of Miami beach.  Not Inundated with businesses just pure beach.  Also the nature bike/walk path lined with sea grape trees before heading to the sand and beach is an added feature for a peaceful walking or biking experience.  You wouldn't know you're in busy Miami beach."
nice beach,January 2017,40,Surfside Beach,8weeksormore,The whole beach area is nice there is also a pedestrian walk way further from the beach. This is great when its windy
Great,January 2017,50,Surfside Beach,aellituv,Great fun having a drink from the coconut.
Pretty area but horrible traffic!,January 2017,30,Surfside Beach,ChrisnSC,"This is a nice beach, great walking paths with a view of the ocean.  The traffic is horrible and made worse by paid parking.  There is no free parking."
Calm,March 2016,40,Surfside Beach,GiCova,I have been there in October 2015. The weather was nice that time and the water warm.
Great ride,August 2013,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Foodiemia,"We spent a Sunday morning riding in Key Biscayne and decided to cross the bridge to Virginia Key.  Since we came by bike we were not charged the $6 / car entrance fee.  This fee seems very small if you plan to spend a family day  at the beach.   We were surprised by how well laid out the whole park area is.  It was an easy ride through the main road and some side roads.  I remember coming to this beach in the 80's and even though it was quiet and serene, it had fallen into disrepair.  At the northern end we found excellent mountain trails maintained by volunteers.  At first we were a little hesitant, but were so glad we tried out the ""novice"" trail that had picture perfect views of downtown Miami and Miami Beach.  The volunteer crew even lent us a couple of helmets which we had not brought.   There are many  areas undergoing restoration which will hopefully restore the native hammocks and beach areas.  Will return to try out the biking trails again and also try out the hiking trails."
Not like it used to be,July 2013,30,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,jeweltones,"We drove around the Miami Marine Stadium, which is on Virginia Key, to see it again because I used to go to the boat races there in the 70's--what great fun they were!!  Then we drove over to Virginia Key Beach, near the Marine Stadium.  The beach is nothing like it used to be. Virginia Key Beach was THE beach in the 70's.  Everybody went there.  South Beach didn't exist.  It was lined with old dilapated hotels filled with elderly people sitting around.  It was known for that. The art deco hotel transformations came in the 80's.  Virginia Key Beach was the main beach and it was beautiful. Palm trees studded the beach and other tropical vegetation  You could cook out on the beach, picnic, and it was a major family beach.  I still have photos of the way it was. The zoo was in Crandon Park on Key Biscayne--the Crandon Park Zoo.  After the beach we would go to the zoo, it was close by. Everything was free. The beach was closed for a time, then it was decided to renovate it, which they are doing now.  Unfortunately, it will never be like the old beach. The beaches on Key Biscayne are better, especially Cape Florida Bill Bagg's State Park.  If you go to the end you can look out over the water and see Stiltsville, or see a manatee, or, go to the lighthouse area which is very pretty. We've seen weddings there."
nice beach,May 2014,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,rene2014123,"my family and I enjoy our favorite beach , during the weekdays you will seldom see anyone else, during the weekend is jammed packed, nice shades, picnic tables and pavilions , all free with the $6.00 entrance fee."
Clean and full of fun,July 2014,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Grifan,"If you stay in Downtown, Brickel or somewhere very close to them, it is only one possible closest way to get to the beach. But anyway you can find there a lot of fun starting from regular sunbathing to any sport activity you can imagine. Most likely it will be jetski and water jetpack, but you never forget you experience on them))"
barnacle estate,November 2015,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,monique684,"right in the center of coconut grove. My son got married there. ceremony held on the terrace. the building itself was closed, it not always open to the pubic. it is pretty ground, by the sea.arrangements can be made to visit the house"
Was just ok ..,December 2015,20,Barnacle State Historic Site,949JessicaK,"Nice spot to stop in if you are already in the area but definitely do not go out of your way (like we did) and fight the crazy traffic and nonsense parking issues to only be disappointed .. cute , historic . but no "
Small Hidden Gem,January 2016,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,Miamismith305,"The park has a beautiful view of Biscayne Bay. According to its website ""The Barnacle is the oldest house in Miami-Dade County still standing in its original location and is a tangible reminder of Miami's nautical roots in a simpler time"". The park offers concerts and plays, and it is geared more toward people who appreciate nature and tranquillity."
Very little to see and do,February 2016,20,Barnacle State Historic Site,nzargie,"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place, but I couldn't fathom spending more than a 15-20 minutes there to see the hosue."
Really nice,September 2015,50,CocoWalk,henryc509,"A good space for relaxing and having fun with your family, relatives or acquaintances. It's my first time and I liked. I recommend this place. "
Really Boring,August 2015,20,CocoWalk,humb_lumi,"Nothing really interesting to do here. There are some restaurants and stores, but just the usual ones you find everywhere, the place looks good but it was empty and looked depressing. Unless you are staying in the neighborhood, there is no reason to visit it."
Quite Beach,September 2016,50,Surfside Beach,victoriacedwards,"Quiet beaches located in North Miami, away from crowds in South Beach. Mostly residential, not very crowded during the week or on weekends."
Clean and beautiful,April 2017,50,Surfside Beach,Darla P,We loved this beach.  Clean sand and the beach was not cluttered with people.  Also noted it was frequently patrolled by the local Police Department. 
best beach view in miami,April 2017,40,Surfside Beach,Tone B,this lovely strip of beach is generally not so crowded or loud. come early morning or in the eveing for a spectacular view. The water is always a little softer than further south and the sand is plentiful and not grainy. They do a great job with the sea-wall foliage. Parking nearby is available and there are nice walking paths around the area. altogether a fabulous beach.
Absolutely wonderful stay at a fabulous Hotel,March 2017,50,Surfside Beach,dennisrivard,Not only do they have great amenities with the Beach and Pool areas but also at the restaurants and bar offerings.
Don't miss this little jewel,June 2013,50,Olympia Theater,Ana Maria R,"Find any excuse to attend some presentation here. Tucked away in an unassuming downtown corner sits this little theater, built in 1926 as a silent movie palace, it has been beautifully restored and is now a beacon of the South Florida Arts community.  You will find presentations from movies, to operas, to concerts, to meetings, pick one and gape at the ceiling :)"
Step back in time.,August 2013,50,Olympia Theater,Laura M,Beautiful theatre and exceptional acoustics.  Any performance will be enhanced just from being at Gusman.
A MIAMI GEM,February 2013,50,Olympia Theater,baird t,Any performance at Gusman is memorable. 
"Performing playing, arts",April 2013,50,Olympia Theater,Kingdown4119,"Place to eonjoy arts, showing playing, opera, even a place to have a showing work. Have parking lot around the area and very closest of tourist downtown area and port."
Beautiful,February 2014,50,Olympia Theater,mojoman580282,"What a fabulous theatre. The show I went to see was Tommy Emmanuel and Martin Taylor and the sound was excellent. Inside, around the stage was decorated as a baroque/Mediterranean style. The location is good on Flagler Street, with car parks near by. I was in town at 3pm and used a car lot on 2 Street, had something to eat, then went back to move my car before closing at 10pm. There is a garage opposite the lot for $1 per hour after 6pm.No problem walking back to the garage after the show at 11pm."
Who Knew!,February 2014,50,Coral Gables Museum,NinBusiness,"This museum while small compared to others around town , has a quaint and uniqueness of it's own. Always finding interesting and innovative ways to get the local community involved. After all isn't that what museums are suppose to do? From Parcor adventurist jumping off walls to more subdue lessons  of Rums from different countries. It really is very informative and always a great time. The Architecture is very reminiscent of the Spanish era and it's beautiful surroundings. Excellent to visit during the Gallery walks.  A must on my list !"
More Spanish architecture,March 2014,50,Coral Gables Museum,Alma K,A small museum but very much part of the community with events outside on the plaza every week and changing exhibitions and concerts inside
Informative and Friendly,February 2014,40,Coral Gables Museum,534kelly,I would highly recommend doing the walking tour for the interesting history and it is a bargain since you get to also see the museum at the end.
I Found That I Don't Really Care About the History of Coral Gables That Much,August 2013,30,Coral Gables Museum,wehaveapiperdoone,When we went there was a mini-golf course set up and it was run down and broken--not at all fun to play. The rest of the museum was dedicated to the history of the area and all I learned was that I really didn't care about the history of the area that much.
Hidden Paradise,May 2014,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Paulo R,"Virginia Key Park is across street from the Miami Seaquarium. There is a fee for each car entering the park, which I pay even if I am just spending an hour sightseeing. But the beach is a hidden paradise. You don't hear much about it but when you get there and find that beautiful beach with parking, cabanas, calm and very clean waters you feel like including this destination in your must see map of Miami. I would avoid weekends, since like most beaches in Miami, it is full of people making barbecue. But during week days, there is very few people and you feel like being on a private beach. Also like other beaches in Miami, there are pebbles (rounded/ pointless rocks) near the water but the ""torture"" of crossing the 6 feet layer is compensated by the wonderful water."
Pre cruise vacation,July 2015,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,ChrisF5024,Beautiful views warm water and phenomenal sand beneath our toes.  Love love it  also for the photographer in you the lighthouse and dunes give great focal points.  
Cool,June 2015,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Fernando L,"Nice place to go. A lot of families due the calm water. There is a guy renting chairs and umbrela. This facilities help to spend the hole day, so take some food and drinks. "
"Nice Scenery, Great views of city skyline.",May 2015,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Nevetsdav,This is a great place for a park out outing with the family or couples. I enjoyed the views of Miami's skyline. Nice getaway from the city and busy South Beach.
Virginia Key Beach Park,March 2015,30,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,387indy,"Near Miami Seaquarium with view of Miami skyline. Water is calm, green water perfect for swimming, paddleboarding, kayaking, sailing and cycling. No lifeguards and no bathrooms. Parking is free."
Surprising little park,March 2016,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,LollypopSunshine,We passed well over an hour here and really enjoyed the visit.
Lovely piece of preserved Miami,April 2016,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,koh256,"We visited here and my kids were surprised at how interesting the house was and the things they could see in what is a small state park. The house is very well preserved and has a very interesting story, it is well worth paying for the tour which takes you through the house and shows off artefacts from an age gone by. Lovely views of the bay too."
A little narrow strip of green,April 2016,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,kimibar,"This is a nice, short walk to one of the few ways to get to the shore in Coconut Grove (which is mostly harbors on the water). It was private property of someone who was inventing outrigger+sail boats. His boat slip is still there and some of the little sheds or houses, but it's not really set up as a museum or anything. There are no chairs or benches at the water's edge. But it's a pleasant momentary escape from the main roads. "
Old Venue.,December 2011,30,Olympia Theater,REYNALDO M,"The Gusman Center is an old venue that is adequate I guess for small local events. It is old, but worth supporting."

A Perfect Venue,January 2013,50,Olympia Theater,Bill K,"Located on the Campus of The University of Miami this venue is small (capacity around 1,000) and the acoustics are perfect. Saw a performance last night and found it to be roomy and comfortable. Right now there is construction all around that area of UM's Campus so parking can be challenging, but the venue is a delight."
Gusman Center,January 2013,50,Olympia Theater,Graybeeker,Convienent location in the downtown are of Miami. The theater/building has been an icon of the downtown for a very long time. It was renovated many years ago to keep it thriving.

Horse Country's Most Welcoming Ranch!,November 2013,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Peter C,"I happened to be driving through Miami's Horse Country this morning with my two-year old daughter, when I noticed the welcome sign for Jesse William's Ranch.  The ranch looked so welcoming with kids riding horses that I decided to drive in so that my 2-year old could get a better look at the horses.  I was greeted by the owner and several other children and trainers.  Everyone was so kind and even though I didn't know much about horses they were willing to give us a ""grand tour"" of the ranch where my daughter was able to see horses, goats, chickens and more exotic animals such as lemurs, monkeys etc...   It was truly a treat for both me and my daughter and we are heading back there in the next weeks to ride a pony.  This is a great place for all kids in the Miami Westwood Lakes/Kendall/Doral area as well as visitors to Miami.  I think everyone should come out and take a stroll through this wonderful ranch."

Thursday night,March 2016,40,CocoWalk,CaymanGreg,"this mall with cinema has an interesting courtyard and you can sit out there with a coffee or gelato and watch the world go round. The place is always busy and thursday was no exception. The shops are not that interesting but the energy is good, there is parking right there and a number of great restaurants in the area.

People watching and shopping!,March 2016,30,CocoWalk,ANGELA K,Only down side was the traffic roaring past 
Small mall ,April 2016,30,CocoWalk,TwoOhTwo,"Not too sure what people are raving on about, it's a small mall with a few places to eat, drink and (quite a few places more) to shop. It has a cinema and a nice outdoorsy type atmosphere to it, but at the end of the day the shops don't stand out in any way from others in the area (except for the pan am store, which has a great display that makes the who,e centre worth visiting)"
Interesting shopping / dining area with a cinema,March 2016,40,CocoWalk,CindyW2010,"Small outdoor shopping and dining center offers convenient parking via street or garage.  Different mix of restaurants, gelato, coffee, etc.  - we didn't find any place to eat to our liking but there are several restaurants across the street and down the street from this shopping center.  Quite a few vacant store fronts and probably would not consider this a one-stop shopping destination.  Best for people watching over dessert or coffee.  There is a cinema on the upper level as well as a comfortable outdoor sports bar. Landscaped nicely and very easy to walk around."
Walkable,April 2016,40,CocoWalk,Janet G,"This strip includes many shops and restaurant. You can easily walk around window shop, grab an ice cream or have nice meal or grab and go. The overall vibe is very hip but not pretentious. It is family friendly withou being overrun with kids. Most restaurants have outdoor seating.

Historians delight,October 2014,50,Olympia Theater,cuse_41,"You would never know that there was such a treasure hidden behind the contemporary façade of this building.  Opened in 1926 as a silent movie palace it has been beautifully restores.  It is spell binding with stunning Moorish architecture, perfect acoustics and a simulated night sky, complete with wafting clouds and twinkling stars.  I just love any opportunity to visit it.   Granted there are disadvantages no parking so use the MetroRail/mover.  Night life in the area non existent.  But if there is something being presented you want to see I heartily recommend going - it only enhances the performance.  "
One of the best!,October 2014,50,Olympia Theater,Axel P,The architectonic here is unbelievable. The acoustic is excellent too. Any concert here sounds amazing. The ceiling seems a wonderful night full of stars. I think is the most beatiful theather I had ever seen!

A beautiful Miami landmark.,February 2012,50,Olympia Theater,G C,"When I was a child, I saw several movies at this venue as it was the the old Olympia Theater. Now it's called Miami's Olympia Theater at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts. I saw several concerts there in the 80's like Jimmy Buffet and Arlo Guthrie. This theater has been beautifully restored and is just as majestic as some of the memorable theaters like the Fox in Atlanta. This venue and the Fox in Atlanta have architectural similarities. Now matter what you attend at this venue, the history and beauty will make it memorable. Enjoy !"

Wrong name on this location,October 2015,30,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Appendixquarterhorse,This location is actually called HISTORIC Virginia Key beach. It used to be the only colored only beach in Miami during the segregation era. The REAL Virginia Key beach is a little ways down the same road that this beach is on. When you have to choose to go left or right go left and you will reach Virginia Key Beach
Historic Virginia Key Beach,November 2015,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,mstanyalopez,This park was created in 1945; it was segregated for Africans only. The park has a merry go round and a mini train. My son and I were able to enjoy. Two playgrounds beautiful water & plenty of parking the park is still being renovated but we got the opportunity to see the largest sand castle in the world. The mosquitoes are bad be sure to take repellent. But other than the beach park is equipped with a bike trail bikes for rent or bring your own large pavilions.

Quality time,March 2016,20,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,VivN218,It did have the largest sand castle which was cool.
Fantastic padded running path and a wonderful frozen lemonade truck in the parking lot!,April 2014,50,Kennedy Park,SMF2_On-The-Go,The frozen lemonade stand/truck offered a refreshing treat after a long walk.  We would definitely visit this park again.  And it's free but there is limited parking.
The Park and the marina is quite good.,September 2014,40,Kennedy Park,travellersfootprint,"I walked all the way from Coco Walk in Coconut grove to the Kennedy park and this 40 minute walk took me through the Marina filled with Yachts,the Bay side, Monty's the restaurant and finally Kennedy park. A good place to relax or Jog in a green environment. Lots of places to sit and enjoy nature."
Kennedy Point Park,October 2014,50,Kennedy Park,Dibird50,A quaint little park on the water.  You can walk around and there is a marina with many boats and  a very nice view
"Good place for weddings, jogging",March 2016,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,Sandy J,It is a free admission with of course a suggested donation. I've seen 4-5 weddings being held here and it makes nice pictures and great for a shabby chic style kind of wedding!

Go when there is something else going on,October 2015,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,Tony053,Somewhat interesting but much better when there is an outdoor concert or other event going on.

First time ,July 2016,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,miamiblogger, 
Gem of a state park,August 2016,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,annettefromm,"This park preserves the remains of one of Miami's oldest properties, right on a slice of Biscayne Bay.  It's a treasure and am amazing escape from the city's hustle and bustle.  Make sure to time your visit for a tour of the house."
Pretty to watch,December 2011,30,Coral Gables City Hall,sevillanitacubanita,"Just interesting to drive by and or stop by if you are walking around in Coral Gables, learn a bit of the history of the city. This is at the end of Miracle MIle. You can apply for a passport here. On Saturdays there is a farmer's market by here before the hot months start."
Historic,January 2013,50,Coral Gables City Hall,Edmund438,"When one visits Coral Gables, one must tour the historic City Hall Building to appreciate the architecture and preservation of this local monument.  "

Loved this street with its many shops and restaurants,November 2013,50,Coral Gables City Hall,Schm00py,One could spend an hour or a day eating and shopping on this little gem in the heart of Coral Gables.
"Pretty building from outside, no need to go inside",March 2014,30,Coral Gables City Hall,Erhan E,"It's a nice building from outside but inside is cramped and not maintained well. If you are in the area, stop by to check it from outside but not worth going out of your way to see it."
An amazing way to spend a day without technology!!!!!!!!!!!,May 2014,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Jorge H,I can guarantee that me and the family will be back a few times a year. Thanks to the Team at Jesses Williams Ranch you guys are great.

Weekend FUN!!,June 2014,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,EddieG17,"For anyone looking for something fun to do on the weekend, the ""Jesse Williams Ranch"" is a great way to have some fun.  My son loved riding the beautifully groomed, well kept horses.  Jesse, himself was there to explain every little step to my 9 year old son.  My son was very at ease by the friendly staff and well trained horses.  Just when we thought we couldn't have anymore fun, we walking over to the exotic animals, which my son LOVED.  We were able to get up close to animals you don't get to see everyday!!!  All in all we enjoyed our time there.  It was something I recommend to families with young ones for good family fun :)"
Great Place to Visit with your family,June 2014,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Maria N,"My family and I visited Jesse's farm while we were in Miami and had a great time! This was our third time and we always make a point to go there whenever we are in Miami. There are amazing exotic animals that you can see, feed and pet. The staff is very friendly and informative. There are horses available to ride, brush and bathe. It's a very hand on and engaging experience for adults and especially children. They will see and learn things at Jesse's Ranch that they will not see anywhere else. It's a very intimate learning experience. We spent hours there and wished we could have stayed longer! This is a must experience while in Miami. Our favorite part of our entire trip. Can't wait to go back."
CocoWalk,July 2016,50,CocoWalk,mazindhaif,Nice place to go to. Few shops and outdoor restaurants. Best time to visit is in the evening. You could spend a nice couple of hours after the beach.

Nice upscale lifestyle center,July 2016,50,CocoWalk,alvamae,"Nice upscale lifestyle center. Nice atmosphere at night. Great for walking. Outdoor restaurants, coffee shop... Several options for hanging out (there is a theater)."
We went to Cinepolis movie theater,June 2016,50,CocoWalk,Michael B,The theater sells assigned seating. Very comfortable lounge chairs that reclined. Prices are competitive with other theaters. Very enjoyable place to see a movie.
BEWARE - Parking is a scam,August 2016,10,CocoWalk,CeliaB392,"We parked for less than 2 hours at the Grand Street Garage.  The ticket payment center charged us $18.00.  We thought it should be just a little over $3.00.  But figured we mis-read the sign at the garage entry and figured it was quite expensive with a lesson learned.  On our way out, the sign read ""maximum of $15.00 for lost ticket.""  So this is when we knew we had been ripped off.  My advice is park anywhere but the CoCoWalk garages. There does appear to be a lot of other parking with fixed rates."
Quaint and quieter beach,January 2018,50,Surfside Beach,cnotyepb,If you want to avoid the crowds of most the Miami area beaches then go to Surfside.  The dune placement makes this a more secluded area.  Stroll along the pedestrian and bike paths nestled between the dunes and the closest resorts.  
Away from the Crowd,December 2017,50,Surfside Beach,Nicolas B,"This portion of Miami Beach offer you less congested beach areas, is you are looking for a more relax oriented beach day, worry free about who's around or just feeling too cramped as some other locations."

Nie Quiet,March 2018,40,Surfside Beach,jointfilms,I was here during Spring Break and the beach remained pretty quiet and uncrowded. It's a pretty short beach meaning once you hit the sand the water is breaking only a few feet away. But since things were quiet it wasn't a big deal.
Surfside Beach,February 2018,40,Surfside Beach,LollysLook,"The Surfside Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach that seems less crowded than some of the others. Its within walking distance of the restaurants, bars and has a lifeguard"
Magnificent,October 2015,40,Olympia Theater,rschagrin,I was blown away by the beauty of this magnificent theater. It looks like circa 1920's Art Deco.
Awesome venue,November 2015,40,Olympia Theater,Y33RZsarahs,"Saw Damien Rice here this past weekend. Amazing show and a great venue. My only issue was the quality of the pit seats - they were very narrow chairs and uncomfortable, but still worth it to be that close to the stage. Well staffed and maintained. Would go to a concert there again!"
Lovely,November 2015,50,Olympia Theater,northwoodstraveler57,"Really beautiful theater. Great atmosphere, easy to get to, great inexpensive valet parking. I would agree with a previous reviewer in noting that pit seats left a little to be desired. Nobody sat next to me, so it was comfortable, but might have been tight otherwise. I saw Sufjan Stevens, and the cozy and beautiful theater complimented his perfection nicely."
Lovely venue,October 2015,50,Olympia Theater,GabbyFrey,Attended the Krafwerk concert with my husband. It was our fist time at the Olympia Theater. The valet parking was not expensive and the gentleman who took our car was very cordial. Once you step in the theater you feel transported into a different era. It is truly beautiful in there. The staff at the bar was also very pleasant. Overall a great experience.
Outstanding locale.  Back to the twenties.,January 2016,50,Olympia Theater,Hy L,Saw an improve theatre there.   Real thrill was the tour of a 1920 ties gem   Large thousand + seat theatre wiith Italianate theme.  Spectacular feel.

Typical small city attempt,November 2015,30,Coral Gables Museum,jbcarioca,The Coral Gables Museum looks interesting but really has only a couple rooms of modest interest. It still is worth visiting if you're in Coral Gables and have extra time it is worth a visit
a museum with no art collection to speak of,December 2015,30,Coral Gables Museum,baruj s,there is an entrance charge of $7 unless you are a member.
Enlightening and interesting historical exhibit on Coral Gables,April 2016,50,Coral Gables Museum,210daisy,the museum has interesting exhibits on both local historical topics as well as education and enlightening exhibits on the local community impact of the environment.
Take an easy walk through the past of the Beautiful City,March 2016,40,Coral Gables Museum,Donnalynn P,"We literally were not expecting to visit. We met my boyfriends father randomly in town. He was on his lunch break. He asked us if we had every been to the museum. We told him no. We continued to walk him back to his office. He said go this way.. We followed him down the street. He opened the door, and paid for our entry and left us to enjoy. We laughed as we felt like he was dropping us off with the sitter. But started exploring. There is an audio tour as you walk from room to room. I think this is a nice trip for anyone with a bit of free time, and you are not committing to all day. Stop by Books and Books on your way out and have a coffee, or cocktail. It is a pretty city. "
Picture perfect,May 2016,30,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Adriana E,"Another great relaxing place for photos. Since I live here, I had my maternity photos done here, but also come here to get away..."

Beautiful beach! Historically important site,May 2016,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Motherofchildren,This is one of the most beautiful beaches in Miami and I believe that it is important to teach our children about segregation and America's shameful history of discrimination and oppression of People of Color. 
Hot summer fun near the Vintage Lighthouse!,May 2016,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Loucious,Great place for a Family Outing or just a couple's sun worshipping! Arrive early due to heavy congestion of weekenders! 
Peaceful green areas and big water views.,September 2015,50,Kennedy Park,Ana S,At the back end of this vast park are beautiful bay views. Parking can be tricky at peak weekend times so it's best to bike or jog/walk over if you can.  There are 2 dog parks depending on dog weight and the exercise trail is a great way to work out in an outdoor setting free of traffic.  Take the boardwalk at the back for pretty water views.
Great Bike Ride on the weekend,October 2015,30,Kennedy Park,ritabalz,"In this park every weekend riding bikes with family and love the watching young family with children, volley ball games, soccer, people utilizing the exercise equipment (bit old and outdated) but functional.  "
MY PARK!!,December 2015,50,Kennedy Park,Beckah K,"Being that we are Kennedys we joke that this is our park and I have been playing here since I was a little girl.  I love the view of the water!  And the ""gym equipment"" is great.  The lemonade is super refreshing and everyone seems so happy here.  It is one of my favorite places in Miami!"
Perfect place to enjoy your pet.,November 2015,50,Kennedy Park,Hy L,Lovely Bayside Park.  Three large cultural seats made for looking at and thought.  Dog area full of people enjoying each other and their pets. Great views of the Bay.
Green grass,October 2015,50,Kennedy Park,Jaime L,"There is not much if anything to see at this park. You go there to relax, do some exercise if you are inclined to do so, walk your dog, there is a fenced area for large dogs and another one for smaller ones. It is mostly grass and scattered trees here and there, but overall a nice setting to do nothing."
Pathetic as a park but....,February 2017,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,662marc,"The barnacle house tour was interesting. The best part of this tiny, and I do mean tiny, park is the walk to the pay station. After that it is a long lawn in front of the house. If you want to pay $2.00 just to get away from the bustle and set in a quiter setting than it's fine."
Interesting Historical Site,February 2017,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,moody1779,Barnacle -- the oldest house in Dade County --  is on the water and a 2 minute walk from the heart of the Coconut Grove. It shouldn't be missed when you are in the Grove. 
Kind of interesting,February 2017,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,121RJW,Barnacle State Historic Park preserves the oldest building in the county. It costs only $2 to enter and $3 for a tour of the inside of the house. It was an interesting tour. The interior view of the upstairs area was the most interesting portion of the tour.
A Lovely Spot and a Lovely House,March 2017,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,HistoryLover2017,If you are in Miami and in the Coconut Grove area please don't miss this lovely house - the oldest structure in Miami still standing where it was built.  The new skyscrapers are magnificent but please go to Barnacle House and see where it all began about 120 years ago.  This house was built by a shipbuilder and it has withstood many hurricanes and other bad weather.  It is a graceful and solid house and you will enjoy the short tour which is filled with information and original items from the house.  However the real gem is the house itself built to last.  Enjoy!
Moonlight concert in the park,April 2017,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,jodyj321,"Having decided to have a bit more fun and relaxation we started going to the Barnacle for some of their events. My favorite is the moonlight concerts in which we bring a cooler some lawn chairs and have a lovely picnic. Last weekend a folk singer Keith John(s) was there and he was great, really great. Every concert we've gone to has been a gem. This site is a wonderful Miami treasure. "
"Majestic Building, Gorgeous Holiday Decorations",December 2014,50,Coral Gables City Hall,Volcam,This building occupies the perfect site at a major intersection in Coral Gables.  My wife and I loved being able to see the impressive Christmas decorations that were perfect in scale and theme for the building.  We enjoyed walking around the building and taking several photographs.  All of Coral Gables that we saw was so beautifully decorated for the holiday season.
Beautiful coral rock exterior,May 2015,50,Coral Gables City Hall,debrah454,Love the style of the building and the grounds. Gave us historical back round and the city. It is a small building but very beautiful.

Will be back with more carrots for the horses. "
Awesome experience,August 2014,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Abby F,Crazy animal collection and awesome skilled riding instruction. We had a great time- kids and adults. Definitely going back when we can.
Family afternoon of fun!,September 2014,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,JENS G,"We were delighted with the hospitality of the Jesse Williams Ranch.  You really can stop by any time.  But be sure to bring a BIG bag of carrots.  There were so many animals to feed, our bag lasted just a few minutes.  You will be amazed at the unexpected type of animals you will find there.  A true gem in the city!"
Awesome Place!,October 2014,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Grdguez,"Thank you Jesse and riding instructor, Monica!"
A mall!,November 2016,30,CocoWalk,travelerE7805QJ,"At hotel we were told we had to go to CocoWalk. I assumed this was a walk along the ocean.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed when we were dropped off at a mall. .  It was a lovely outdoor mall, but still a mall!  With all the requisite mall stores. Not much of interest.  So be forewarned !"
"""Don't waste your time or money...Dont believe the hype!""",November 2016,20,CocoWalk,getoutofNJ,We stopped here on our way to the airport coming back from the Keys and boy was that a mistake. We decided to park in there parking garage as the surrounding neighborhood didn't look so safe. We went in only to find there were only a handful of stores actually still operating...The majority of the stores had either moved or closed up shop. I'm sure at one point this place was the place to shop well not the case anymore. We decided to leave after walking around for about 45 minutes as there wasn't much else to see. On the way out the parking attendant says that will be $8 for parking! Are you kidding me? I was here less then an hour.....she says no Saturday and Sunday they charge a flat rate even if your there for ten minutes!...It's ridiculous no wonder this place has gone down hill! My advice stay away! On the way out down the road we did see a larger mall with nicer stores this could be the reason Coco Walk has suffered these changes. Find something else to do but don't go there!
Not worth the HYPE.,November 2016,40,CocoWalk,akshayc35,Nothing fancy out here. You could invest your time travelling to some other location/ just hitting the beach.
Complete waste of time,November 2016,20,CocoWalk,alexdollar,I have been to cocowalk about 15 and 20 years ago I remember it was a really nice trendy social spot in the heart of Miami boy was I really disappointed this time it is rundown unkempt the quality of the tenants and Retail establishments has gone downhill it truly was a big disappointment nothing when I remembered it to be what a shame
Nice Place to see a movie,November 2016,40,CocoWalk,LaBrigitte D,"We saw Almost Christmas at the Cinepolis at CocoWalk. They have assigned comfortable seating in a small spacious theater. The staff were very professional and friendly. We enjoyed the movie and our only complaint was that another moviegoer received a phone call during the movie and had a 5 minute conversation during the movie.  Of course it's not the theaters fault, some people are just disrespectful and have no class."
Walking and Bike paths + Peace and Quiet,May 2018,40,Surfside Beach,AnitaS484,"Much different from other parts of Miami  Beach south of here. There are dual walking / bike paths amongst the dune line. When I was here there was a lot of seaweed on the beach  so not a large area to sit or set up chairs. I love to walk and pick up interesting shells and stones. There were  a lot of coral pieces, stones and even sea  glass."
Surfside Beach is gone,May 2018,10,Surfside Beach,ecb47,"The Surfside beach shore has dissapeared. The little stripof sand left is covered with decaying algae full of flies. The city refuses to acknowledge residents and visitors complaints to fix the problem. The decayin brown algae mountain keeps growing by theday and nobody seems to be interested inpicking it up to clean the beach. It is horrible. Unless you want to bathe in a decaying brown algae pool, go somewhere else."
Reference Trip Advisor,June 2018,50,Surfside Beach,brand0nm332,My valet person was Carl and he was very courteous and hilarious. My first impression of the hotel was initially positive because he was the first person I ran into. First impressions are very important to me and he made an amazing one. I hope the rest of the staff is as professional yet cool and funny as he is.
Lovely area,December 2017,50,Surfside Beach,C4577ARmarinas,"Lovely part of Miami Beach, not as hectic as South Beach, lovely swimming, hotels and close to Bal harbour, favourite area to stay in Miami."
Beautiful & elegant resort!,July 2018,50,Surfside Beach,b0kulb,"We will definitely be back, very soon "
Carl Palmer's Legacy Tour,June 2016,50,Olympia Theater,Ron R,"Awesome venue that is both historic and professional managed. Only grip is they charge $10 for a glass of beer, wine, etc."
Gorgeous theatre steeped in history!,June 2016,50,Olympia Theater,Friscotis,"I went to see the Carl Palmer ELP Legacy show ""Tribute to Keith Emerson"" there and the staff were amazing!  the Guzman is just amazing with such spectacular architectural detail and the acoustics were phenomenal.  It is like steeping back in to the Golden Age of Theatre!  Not a lot of places eat nearby, so eat before heading over there....."
Historic Miami Theater,October 2015,50,Olympia Theater,Jim_and_Gail_Wilbur,"The Olympia Theater is an historic site in downtown Miami. The décor inside is unbelievable for going on 100 years old. Should you have an opportunity to go, do it!"
Olympia Theater,July 2016,50,Olympia Theater,NChardon1,"The Olympia Theater is the most beautiful theater in Miami. The unique architectural style will keep you wondering around, even during a play or concert. It is conveniently located on Downtown Miami Flagler Street. Parking can be difficult at times."
great afternoon,September 2016,50,Olympia Theater,hellothere525,we really loved this place. it was a unique experience and you could feel old Miami when you visit this place
Disappointing,September 2016,30,Coral Gables Museum,volcanojuso,I do not believe it should be categorized as a museum. It has little to offer. Few information and pieces. However you still can enjoy a 20 minutes tour there (tickets cost 7$ while I believe it should be free). I still recommend it if you are already in the area but not to get out of your way to make a visit.
Interesting view of history,September 2016,40,Coral Gables Museum,isaacemjay,"For a visitor to the area who has a little interest in history, I recommend this stop. "
Beautiful old building,September 2016,30,Coral Gables Museum,junebug829,"The building is a beautiful very interesting  example of old coral Gables architecture.  The gift shop is very cute. I have found the exhibits very uneven, not so good to very nice."
Gem of a small museum in the center of the city.,October 2016,50,Coral Gables Museum,Stuart S,Beautifully displayed art museum with an excellent variety of works and rotating exhibitions. They also holds a number of events throughout the year.
A Hit if You're Interested in Coral Gales,October 2016,40,Coral Gables Museum,Pillsbury1111,"The museum staff cares a great deal about the collection and it is evident in how the exhibits are presented and the museum is cared for.  The exhibits profile the city's development and history with great  detail.  Nicely presented.  The city tours could stand improvement though.  The museum's director conducted our tour and she didn't know or misused architectural terms.  If she's going to continue acting as a tour guide, she need to get her act together and use more exacting terms as she conducts tours.  "
Dash at the beach,July 2016,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,sarahburr2017,Beautiful day on the beach. It was not crowded so we had the beach to ourselves. Water was nice and calm. 
What a gem so close to the city,February 2017,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Scott W,"Visited this park for the first time yesterday.   I had no idea it was there and was pleasantly surprised.   Years ago in the segregation days it was the place where African Americans could go to the beach.   Today, It is a very expansive park with nature walks, secluded beaches, picnic areas with grills and covered pavillons, and ristine mangrove areas.   They even have a miniature train and carousel that I understand operate on busy days/weekends.    Also a huge sandcastle that you cannot miss.      The park staff seem to be doing a great job keeping up what they have and it was very clean.   Could have more showers/bathrooms but the ones they have a adequate.   Open morning to sunset.   We were there as well for a drive in movie that was great.   It seems to be used a lot for big events on weekends.   "
Miami Boat Show Visit,February 2017,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Kelly_Hicks_1963,"We visited the park in our 40' Monaco RV for 3 nights during the 2017 Miami Boat Show. Daytime parking was $10. Overnight was $110 per night paid in advance with no hookups. The park closes at dusk and has nice beaches, picnic area w/charcoal grills. There is a Winn Dixie close by on Key Biscayne for charcoal and meat. Excellent Hiking and biking both in the park and on the key. They also have the worlds tallest Sandcastle."
"Lovely place to walk, picnic or have beach time.",March 2017,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Rebecca W,"Fight you way they the traffic in Miami, to Virginia key . It is a lovely beach minutes from downtown Miami."
Dirty beach...,April 2017,20,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,fioremoyoli,"The water and the sand was dirty, Broken glass and cans inside the water, very dangerous. The parking was so expensive for this careless beach."
Knowledgable staff made art museum delightful,December 2015,50,de la Cruz Collection,miamirower,"The de la Cruz Collection is a terrific small museum specializing in contemporary art.  It usually is not crowded so viewing is comfortable and unhurried.  On our last visit we had access to several knowledgeable staff members who provided valuable educational information and made our experience so much more interesting.  My friends and I especially appreciated the booklets that are available for each of the 3 floors that provide background on the artists and explain their concepts.  So even if you aren't lucky enough to have staff members to interact with, the museum provides you with enough guidance that you come away feeling like you have really learned a lot about the artists and the art that you have seen. The fact that the museum is in the Design District is an added plus.  Before or after your museum visit you will have access to many fine restaurants as well as amazing stores and architecture.   This museum is a must for Miamians to visit often and for tourists who love art to add to their itinerary."
Thank you!,January 2016,50,de la Cruz Collection,Lesly P,"Thank you for sharing your amazing art collection with the public! The staff is nice and trained, always offering explanations, details on the art... Cultural Must in Miami!"
"Contemporary Works in a Lovely, Simple Venue.",February 2016,40,de la Cruz Collection,813kristing,"With the high ceilings and careful arrangement, the art space shows as well or better than many modern museums. The exhibition I saw, ""You've Got to Know the Rules...to Break Them,"" showed an expanse of media with a range of expression. What I saw was all toward the modern end and included the likes of Martin Kippenberger and Evan Holloway. Many larger than life works seemed completely at home in this sizable space. Housing 20 or so works, the exhibitions seems to change with some frequency - all graciously provided from the private de la Cruz collection AT NO COST. Unpretentious, though it likely had the right to be so, this was a real treat. VERY glad to have made the trip and I'd bet you would enjoy it too."
Educational art center,February 2016,50,de la Cruz Collection,Yvonne C,"Interesting collection in the design district, the museum has big format art work. People from the museum are nicely available for visitors to introduce the collection is been shown.  It gives you a different perspective of what you are looking at. I am very grateful for the Cruz family that open their collection to the public. "
Mediocre at Best,December 2017,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,696carlitosc,"I’ve been here about 3 times now and every time I like it less. Entrance is $37 but I had a coupon for $5 off and my daughter got in for free . First of all the food , you have 2 choices FRIED, FRIED , FRIED or old food they can’t sell. The rides, good if you’re an adult but not that many options for little kids. The constant harassment from the carnival games is enough in itself to never make me want to go there again. I hate being persuaded to play those gimmicky games and get a prize worth 25 cents, that’s why they always tell you we’ll guarantee you win something. The bathrooms, very small and of course there’s an attendant outside waiting holding the paper towels hostage until you tip him , if I want to experience that I would just go to any club in Miami . Face painting $8 ?!?! Worst part of all is paying $20 to take a picture with “santa”, I’m already down about $75 . Last but not least , the petting zoo is no longer there , and that’s the one thing my daughter was looking forward too . In conclusion this place is too far, too expensive and too annoying to ever return there . "
"Packed, expensive but fun ",December 2017,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,jlobianco44,It was most certainly a nice atomosphere. It had the holiday spirit. It’s definitely something I may want to experience again but it got pretty expensive. Lots of food and drinks. The lines were long and the place was packed. Had to buy express passes to even think about getting on rides in a reasonable time. It’s a great South Florida kick off to your holiday so don’t count it out completely! 
Lights and more lights,December 2017,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,peteivonne,Took my grandson to the park for a Christmas outing. The park trees are adorned with thousands of lights. The park offers some carnival type rides. Is a nice place to experience once. 
Beautiful and Expensive,December 2017,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,AprilRain35,"Oh, and as a tip... if you don't have any issues with walking a little, don't bother paying for the trolley. The make it seem as if they are dropping you to the front entrance and that the walk to the entrance is a mile long... Not! By the time they wait on more patrons, load everyone in and take the slow ride to drop you off near the entrance, you would've wasted more time taking the trolley than you would've if you had just took the short walk. Hope this helps :-)"
IT IS A TOTAL RIP OFF NEVER GO BACK AGAIN,December 2017,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,massim00p,"How can they keep charging for the rides inside, specially for the purpose of going there with kids?"
beautiful park,June 2015,50,Kennedy Park,amatog,Great place to take the kids to run around or just sit under a tree and eat lunch.  There are lots of joggers that use the park.
Where are all the bathrooms??!!!,June 2016,40,Kennedy Park,cvlsmitz,Thanks from the out of towner 
NAMED AFTER A FORMER MAYOR OF MIAMI !!!,June 2016,40,Kennedy Park,Frank d,"When people hear ""Kennedy Park"" they assume it was named after our former president, but this park was actually named after David T. Kennedy a former Mayor of Miami. This is a beautiful park with many things to do including bringing your dog here to play. There's also the big Dinner Key Marina and many walking paths to stroll while enjoying the views of Biscayne Bay."
Greenery to be enjoyed in the core of the Grove,April 2016,50,Kennedy Park,TourGuide-Manager,"Kennedy Park on the left is the Grove’s most popular communal gathering place every weekend of the year filled with Frisbees, soccer players, joggers, volleyball games, bikers, skaters, kites, dogs, fiddler crabs and lovers of all kinds."
Frozen lemonade,August 2015,40,Kennedy Park,Tony053,"Nice little park, and can get a nice water view too. But I love the frozen lemonade truck - you can't miss it - it has been an institution there for years, and you can even buy t-shirts and Frisbees..."
Nothing exceptional,May 2017,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,kattimmat,"Sorry to say, but I did not find any exceptional in this park. It;s not bad, but there are much more beautiful places or historic buildings in Florida. "
Nice park like setting in the heart of Coconut Grove,March 2017,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,Nicandmeg,"Great place to go with family or for couples, beautiful bayviews, great for running around with your children and pet, large open green spaces."
Very little to do at this park,April 2017,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,mmonsalve7,"OK so personally - I liked the park and would rate it a 4 stars because I liked how secluded it was and quiet while being surrounded by bars and restaurants.  However, I know that many people will visit and find that there isn't much to do at this park.  I think its great that the house and its land are preserved.  I took the tour of the house and found it interesting (its only $3).  I believe there are also 1-2 geocaches on this property if you are into that activity.  The view of the water is pretty.  It is also a great place to picnic.  I brought a notebook and wrote for about an hour.  It was very relaxing to sit by the water and write (there are no tables there so I just wrote on my lap).  If you are looking for a park with activities like kayaking, hiking, bike paths, etc, then this will not be the park for you.  If you are searching for somewhere different to sit and meditate or have a quiet moment, then you will love this park."
Worth a visit if you are walking around the Coconut Grove Neigborhood,November 2016,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,Rolando N,"This historic site is kind of hard to find, but if you are walking around Coconut Grove it's a leafy oasis in an urban setting which offers a glimpse into early Miami settlements, architecture and landscape. A very pleasant setting on the bay."
Walk in the park,July 2017,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,gibnsgang5,A nice little nature walk in downtown coconut grove. Experience old coconut  grove by visiting this sweet little gem. 
Little Haiti,October 2015,20,Little Haiti,Bruce M,"Not a good choice  for those without a very strong sense of adventure.  While it is probably fairly benign compared to many spots in the world including I have to suspect a lot of places actually in Haiti, this area is not especially safe for tourists.  I would certainly avoid it at night and if I had a desire for Haitian food I would probably try one north of here in a couple of slightly safer areas.    I remember before the area was known as Little Haiti and the area had some interesting history when it was known as the Lemon City area."
Do not stay or go to Little Haiti if you are a female travelling alone,December 2015,10,Little Haiti,Jaz4064,"No matter if there are some reviews saying 'it's not that bad', stay somewhere else!"
The Problem Is...Where Should You Actually Go??,December 2015,20,Little Haiti,Jessica R,"Little Haiti is also an extended area, but where does one actually explore it??? I have no idea."
Don't go here ,January 2016,10,Little Haiti,Rich U,Take it from a local - don't go here.  Aside from being dangerous there is nothing to see here.  Just a few rough neighborhoods.
Worst Place in Miami,March 2016,10,Little Haiti,Danny R,Got mugged. Life ruined. All because of Little Haiti. Wannabe Little Havana which is way better. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. DRUGS EVERYWHERE.
City Hall building,March 2016,40,Coral Gables City Hall,Johnicek,At the end of Miracle Mile and certainly worth a look around the courtyard at the side of the building and at the beautiful staircase and ceiling inside.
Interesting Architecture,March 2016,30,Coral Gables City Hall,Oldjack,This is an interesting building in an area that has moved to modern style structures and for that reason it is worth a visit. The Coral Gables area is one of the nicer places in Miami and definitely worth a visit as it is close to the Airport.
MAGNIFICENTLY RESTORED BUILDING !!!,June 2016,40,Coral Gables City Hall,Frank d,"This place built in the late 1920's is better today than it was when it was new. The beautiful building, wonderful façade, and marvelous interior have been beautifully preserved and offer the visitor a glimpse of what life was like 100 years ago."
Probably the prettiest building in Coral Gables,December 2015,50,Coral Gables City Hall,afootandahalf,"This is a real landmark in Coral Gables and what a beautiful building.  In December just beside and in their gardens there is a Christmas Market (i think they call it the Christmas park). They have many government services in there, we renewed our daughters passport there."
Great place to visit with the family,March 2015,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Herly0925,I celebrated my daughter's 8th birthday here and it was the most amazing experience. Everyone was very kind and attentive. The kids got to feed the animals and ride a horse. Also they have a variety of wildlife animals. We had our own private area. Great experience!!!
"Horses, horses, horses!!",April 2015,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Simpleenici,"I practically showed up at the ranch with my boyfriend and son and got the best reception.  Jesse gave my son, Luis the most amazing experience.  He was walking the horses into their stalls, he was talking to them and learning how to handle them and getting Hewey ready for riding.  I had a blast feeding everyone apples and spending some time with each and everyone of the horses.  Helen was wonderful!!  We had a great time getting to know her. Each of us took turns riding and then washing Hewey down.  I would totally recommend this place to any family with kids."
A friendly ranch to learn to ride as well as to bond and take care of the horse.,May 2015,40,Jesse Williams Ranch,adrianar866,"I've been searching for a ranch for my daughter to take lessons. I had a wonderful experience at the ranch. Jody, her instructor was very warm and precise with the instructions through the lesson. My daughter felt very comfortable. I also observed that they keep the stables clean and all animals are well taken care of and healthy. Children are taught the value of taking care of animals. I recommend you come and see."
Great experience ,June 2015,40,Jesse Williams Ranch,Kena R,"Is a great opportunity  to learn and enjoy about horses. Very friendly  reception, and good please for all family  members. I went with my 2 years  old  boy, he feed the animals, and enjoyed  the horse training. "
The Best Ranch By Far,March 2015,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,R B,"Personal attention and professionalism. Started going to this ranch in 1976. Hadn't been back in many years. When I returned, the owners treated us like we were family. What a pleasure to see continuity of excellence. Thank you!"
Nice place if you are in the area,December 2016,30,CocoWalk,621simond,If you are in the area this is nice place to people watch and there are some nice shops and restaurants but don't make the trip specially.
Lunch and a movie,December 2016,40,CocoWalk,loujswz,Beautiful day nice setting..Nice to walk around to enjoy a drink and the people.  Has Parking which can be validated.
Ate at fritay,June 2014,50,Little Haiti,JayCalliTours,Ate Haitian food in lil Haiti @fritay their food is different from Jamaican food with its own signature on many things and they have nice cakes as we'll very nice Caribbean food.
"beatiful, modest and affordable area",October 2014,40,Little Haiti,mmm129,"this is the next up and coming neighborhood, venture capitalists!! The adventurous artists and bohemians are just starting to move in. if you are timid, suspicious, and can't see the goodness of self-reliant Haitians and Central Americans who shun governmental assistance, this is not the place for you. the prices on the houses and the hotel rates at the Sinbad and New Yorker Boutique Hotel are still affordable. Take advantage of this beautiful spot before it's spoiled by greedy real estate investors."
Love Little Haiti!,December 2014,50,Little Haiti,G C,"I live in Miami and due to my job I have to visit Little Haiti often.  Since the first day while driving my car to destination I was enjoying so much what I was seeing, and  every time I go I feel the same, I love to go there. It is true , the beauty of little Haiti is not at its architecture, it is in the good energy you feel.  I watch the kids going to school accompanied by their mothers, I watch the old ladies walking the streets wearing the head wrap, I see women and men going to work carrying a plastic bag with their lunch, I see the bakery selling Haitian bread, the small family restaurants, I feel their culture,  I find beauty from all that . This area is not the most beautiful area in Miami, but there live one of the most ,sweet, hardworking and polite people I have ever known since I move to Miami. The best authentic Haitian food is there, by the way it is DELICIOUS!. I have NEVER felt that is an unsafe place.  Unsafe are the areas surrounding Little Haiti, they are: Liberty City and Over town, do not get confused."
the bueaty of little haiti,May 2015,50,Little Haiti,Jahleel D,little Haiti is an amazing place to stay and visit its vast cultures and variety of foods. if your in Miami I think you should visit little Haiti and its art district in midtown/wynwood.
I LIVE IN LITTLE HAITI,June 2015,10,Little Haiti,suzanna f,"Beautiful? Modest? wonderful?  you all dont know what you are talking about, is a very dangerous place. let me not say more.  just put you gas somewhere else, please and please come with bullet proof windows. thanks"
Nice Spot for a Meal and a Movie,February 2017,40,CocoWalk,Fastsailor,"The Cocowalk offers a nice spot in Coconut Grove to enjoy a meal, shop or see a movie. Great late night vibe in a convenient location."
What happened?,March 2017,10,CocoWalk,mrjim,Cocowalk use to be a vibrant spot. Now half the shops are closed and no one is there. Parking lots were half full and free! It was like a ghost town. Lunch at Bici was nice but it was struggling! 
Awful Place Now,March 2017,10,CocoWalk,hopeneverquits,Don't waste your time or money. Coco Walk and the grove have passed away. Rest In Peace. Now it's just our memories of what was once a great place.
Very well kept,January 2019,40,Surfside Beach,bardofabiani,Long sandy beautiful beach ! Very very well kept ! Beware of eating on the beach because the seagulls are waiting for you !!!!
Tranquil,August 2018,40,Surfside Beach,regulartraveller01,One of many walks we were recommended. This has a nice flat straight track and follows a long thin stretch of beach that surprisingly had hardly anyone on it. It was a very clean beach and looked great. A tranquil spot in a busy location. So relaxing.
Clean and not too crowded,February 2019,40,Surfside Beach,Jaynee04,"Just not a lot around neither, to get food or anything you must walk back to the main street but plenty of room to lay in the sand and enjoy a nice beach day"
Every body - every where all sizes shapes & great to get your tan on!!,April 2019,50,Surfside Beach,sarahloainaction,"Though the life saver huts are weird they are colourful & attractions in themselves. The beach was awesome, need to watch out for the diving pelicans, getting fish right next to you. No need to hire seating the sand has spots everywhere to pull out a towel & tan- water was amazing & perfect temperature "
Love it here,May 2019,50,Surfside Beach,550emilm,This is my second time visiting Surfside Beach and I am loving the atmosphere of the whole area. Nice and clean waters (except for the seaweed season) and shopping close by. My family will definitely continue this yearly tradition.
Old World Theater Ambiance in Miami Florida,May 2016,50,Olympia Theater,classact007B,Ornate and beautiful venue. The sky is inside the theater with stars a glitter. Great acoustics and lobby make this a treat for any musical occasion.
"Fabulous Interior, needs some TLC",July 2017,50,Olympia Theater,savedade,"The Olympia (a.k.a. Gusman) is a classic space that almost went away with a wrecking ball to become a parking lot. Fortunately some innovative people kept it from being destroyed like so many other buildings in Miami. It is need of some TLC, and the downtown area at night can be a bit risky. Keep your wits about you and know what is going around the area. Regardless of the rough edges, visit as it is a gem that is worth the visit."
Beautiful historic venue!,August 2016,50,Olympia Theater,laradiva,If you like to travel in time this is a great place to go and visit. The acoustics are good and it is kept so well. 
It was not what I expected,March 2013,20,Little Haiti,andresu724,"When I search about where to go in Miami, I found that Little Haití was very recommended. My first impression was that it is very dangerous, people don´t look nice, also, I don´t found anything interesting. It was a waste of time"
Not somewhere you want to be if you are a tourist,June 2013,10,Little Haiti,MiamiLawman,Not a safe place to visit.
Cultural Life...becoming the melting pot!,August 2013,40,Little Haiti,ThePossibilities,"Do not believe the hype about high crime! Crimes are and can happen anywhere, One must be careful anywhere you go.You must experience for yourself the growing cultural life and arts entertainment. Places to be is Little Haiti Cultural Center during Big Night in Little Haiti  a free night concert by Rhythm Foundation. The cultural center provides on going classes, children program and performances from different organizations and individual artists. The businesses' storefronts have been remodeled. Churchill Pub is not the only place, there is the Little Haiti/Little River ""Sannon"" Park and a few nice restaurants. Near by neighborhoods to the east is Morningside and south is the Miami Design District, Midtown and Miami Design District."
Not for Tourists!,July 2013,10,Little Haiti,Lonnie A,"As a 64 year old, born in Miami. Stay Away even on the adjacent roads including Biscayne Blvd. Don't stop even for coffee. Keep items in your trunk out of sight. I speak from experience and as a victim. Yes crime happens everywhere but more often here."
Only if you're interested drive by shootings!,October 2013,10,Little Haiti,SavvyTraveler78,"I've been a resident of Miami since 1989. LITTLE HAITI IS A VERY BAD AND DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD!!! Folks, this is the worst neighborhood in Miami, most of the violent and gang crime that happen in Miami happen here. I don't even suggest you drive through this area! A couple of reviews here say ""Crimes are and can happen anywhere"" and ""Don't believe the hype about high crime"". Folks, I don't know where this guy went, but there are NO decent parts of Little Haiti. It's dirty, dangerous, very high in crime and there is absolutely nothing to see here... This is not like Harlem in NY where it's a rough area, but has awesome architecture and a rich history. This is a ghetto shanty town. Nothing more, Nothing less."
"So much of Miami's History has occurred here, look it up and go to see it.",December 2016,50,Olympia Theater,joyw891,"I have traveled the world to theaters and this is one of the most spectacularly colorful, ornate, sumptuous environments to see.  Just sit in the seat, look at the midnight blue sky, the stars, the thousands of colors that were copied from the original when it was restored, the peacocks, the everything.  It is a place to remember and you can rent the space for private parties.  You can also rent the historic  A.I. Dupont building across the street, have your reception and speeches in the Olympia, and cross the street for dinner.  I love Miami."
This is Miami's Shining Star...GO!,December 2017,50,Olympia Theater,Ray A,"I was born and grew up in Miami, and this magnificent old theatre is one of Miami's often overlooked highlights.  The Olympia is usually considered THE BEST OF ALL of the elaborate movie palaces from the 1920's.  Better and more beautiful than NY's Roxy, LA's early theatres, and all the rest.  Everywhere, cities had them, and many are gone today, but this is THE ONE...go see the clouds roll across the ceiling, the stars in the ""sky"" twinkle, and the incredible balconies, columns, and spectacular statues and decor everywhere you look.  The Olympia is a TREASURE, DON'T MISS IT!  If there's no big show there, go for a tour.  You'll love it I guarantee.  The stage where even Elvis appeared between the films during the 50s...everybody performed there, and WHAT A FUN PALACE it is!  Your kids have never seen anything like it!"
not very much to see,December 2016,30,Coral Gables Museum,madiestan," a little local musuem, not so much information to see tho, so i was a little disappointed... however if it is raining... take a look"
small but interesting,June 2017,50,Coral Gables Museum,Diane A,well designed from the original coral gables firehouse...exhibits reflect the history of the gables and south florida.
Very bad experience.,March 2018,10,Coral Gables Museum,f16mandy,"Poor collection, Don’t waste your money. You can visit others places in Miami, this collection you can buy it online an put it on you back yark."
Local Museum ,February 2018,50,Coral Gables Museum,SuntanBarbie2014,"Beautiful and historic building that was completely renovated for local community. Located in downtown City Beautiful, this museum host many exhibitions, lectures, family activities, tours, jazz concerts, etc. There is always something going on.  Easy to pop in, get some information regarding the neighborhood, tips for tourists, etc. We support this museum in all their endeavors. They recently had a “Red Cross” exhibit, which was so interesting to read how over so many years the Red Cross efforts have assisted South Florida. Beautifully recorded memories with uniforms and photographs were on display. Open to the public. Parking on streets and in local parking decks. "
cute museum,November 2017,50,Coral Gables Museum,atraveler300,small but pack full of information. a great place to visit with a cute gift shop. worth the effort. the grandkids love it and at time they have a putt-putt course inside and music concerts in court yard
Beautiful Beach,October 2017,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Alex Emilio P,"This beach is magical. You feel like in paradise. Far from the busy and noisy beaches, it's more than worthy to go ! "
"Nice for a romantic walk on the beach, family picnics, and outdoor parties.",July 2017,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,622elianap,The beach is pretty though not a lot of sand.  It is good for walking or just sitting and staring out at the ocean.
The Best Kept Secret Beach in Miami,December 2017,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,JMF8,"This is where locals go because it is beautiful, clean and pristine, with the feeling of being on a deserted island and yet with sweeping views of Biscayne Bay. South Beach is for tacky tourists. Key Biscayne Virginia Beach is for locals ""in the know."""
Historical and beautiful beach,June 2018,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Arielfl,"Today you can visit this historic beach for an $8 cash only entrance fee on the weekends or $6 weekdays. Your kids can still ride on the antique carousel or play on the expansive playground. There is a restroom and vending machines in the park. A concession stand operates on a limited seasonal schedule. There are picnic tables, grills, hiking trails, mountain bike trail, wetlands, and ocean front cabin rentals. The worlds largest sandcastle built by Turkish Airlines is great for pictures as is the beautiful view from the beach. I came on a rainy Saturday afternoon to march with Lummi Nation from the Pacific Northwest. They were in town to ask for Tokitae/ Lolita who resides across the street in the Miami Seaquarium in the smallest orca tank in North America to be given back to them as she was stolen from their ancestral water. It is a short walk to the Miami Seaquarium from the park. It is well worth the entrance fee to the park to be able to enjoy some of the best beach front amenities Miami has to offer."
"Nasty!, seaweed and dirty",June 2018,10,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,lanamari,"We paid $10 to get in.  We parked and walked up to beach and their were red flags.  It was so choppy and rough!.  We left and was able to get my money back but he was rude about it.  I said I just came though, he said he remembered what was the problem?  I told him he should let people know before they oay that the flags are red.  He told me it was red everywhere.  I said, no just came from Bill Baggs and it wasn't rough, he said I should of stayed there! Rude people!!"
Just a hood,May 2012,20,Little Haiti,miamiajp,"Considering years ago you couldn't drive through this neighborhood without getting shot at, what the Haitian community has done is remarkable. Still, it's just another Miami neighborhood, with not much to see except the MOCA (Miami Museum of Contemporary Art)"
GHETTO,September 2011,30,Little Haiti,angie2226,its pretty ghetto over there.there are prostitutes and crack heads in the street
Bad neighborhood!!,August 2011,30,Little Haiti,lalocadr19,Good place to go and get good krio and fried platain. Must go during the day time to avoid getting mug or rob. The street and business need remodeling extensively.
Culture,May 2012,40,Little Haiti,john p,"I work not too far, therefore, i have occasion to drive through often.  The neighborhood is essentially a low income area with a lot of soul.  I have always felt relatively safe in the area and the you will experience the Haitian Culture. Haitians are hard working loving people.  There are some typical restaurants, book stores and lots of Haitian art and lively colors.  You will enjoy the experience as it will take you out of the ordinary.  Have fun.  "
Not that great,August 2011,10,Little Haiti,VALKLERE,"I live in miami for years now and there are two neighborhoods I saw (by accident) and I wish I didn't: little haiti and liberty city. The reason: crime infested, dirty and basically looks similar to bad parts of bronx, detroit, baltimore, etc... why would you go there unless you live there?? These parts are avoided by people who live in MIA, so as a tourist you should DEF not go there!"
Interesting,January 2017,30,Bay of Pigs Museum,TadjuMS,A small museum. No cover to enter. A little one sided. The museum host was friendly and very knowledgable. 
A small museum devoted to the brave men and women who fought in the Bay of Pigs,March 2017,40,Bay of Pigs Museum,949sharonl,"This visit gave me a desire to learn more.  I had forgotten this page of history.....I know I had studied it in school, but now, having visited this place, I need to do more research.  I thought, at first, that it wasn't open, because the front gates were locked. It turns out that I had to enter from the side of the parking lot."
Most interesting,May 2017,50,de la Cruz Collection,markmd,"We were fortunate enough to have Daniel guiding us through this most remarkable private collection, fortunate because of Daniel's detailed knowledge and obvious affection for the art. Aside from the extensive collection, we learned that the De la Cruz family are true and selfless philanthropists who not only display their art without charge, but sponsor (pay for) extended student art tours to Europe, Asia, etc."
Spectacular exhibition of contemporary art,December 2017,50,de la Cruz Collection,joesChicago,"This, yet another, fantastic exhibition of contemporary art is part of the collection of the De La Cruz family.  It is virtually next door to the Institute of Contemporary Art.  Much of the work is monumental in size and the collections have some overlaps and compliment one another."
Really cool contemporary art. Fantastic - and free.,January 2018,50,de la Cruz Collection,RayNYC9,"Really great to see many artists new to me (and I imagine to most.)  Heavy on many from SoCal - often heard of but I'd not seen ""live.""  Sincere thanks to the de la Cruz family for sharing this with us!!"
fascinating worthwhile visit,February 2018,50,de la Cruz Collection,claire1952,gorgeous contemporary collection in extraordinary building. docent/staff members guide the visit with interest and information. 
Very nice for a family trip!,December 2018,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,luiscleghorn,"Good time with the kids and yours, many attractions that reminds me the 80's.  You can eat a lot but honestly it is too expensive the food.  And all the food is ""Carnival food""."
Santa's Enchanted Forest,December 2018,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,387indy,"Theme park with 100 rides, shows, games. They have holiday displays, Christmas tree, good staff, lots of lights."
Great rides but lots of walking,December 2018,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Mrs_G-L,You don't need to pay for the bikes or bus to take you to the entrance - its under a ten minute walk from the car park.
Lots of problems this year,December 2018,20,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Kristigirl,"They are missing rides from the last few years...and it's two of our favorites!  What happened to the giant slide that you walk up with your burlap sack and ride down?  What happened to the giant swings?  My daughter and I were so very upset when we could not locate them!  One carnival worker on the ride that drops straight down did not even want to get up and work the ride....he was so lazy.  He just pointed at my kids from a distance and told us they were too short.  I asked him to get up and measure them.  They weren't.  The dude just was so disinterested in being there in NYE.  On the bright side, NYE is a good time to go with fewer people, but so many of the workers are disinterested in being there!     I also bought a bottled water out of the machine, gave it a $5 bill, and it only gave me 50 cents back.  I was annoyed enough at the $3 charge, only to find that the machine did not give the proper change, so I ended up paying $4.50 for a bottle of water.  The prices for food are pretty preposterous too.  We had bought fast passes for that night, only to find out we never needed them.  They should not allow anyone to buy fast passes on nights that are slow.  Or they should give you the option at the park, not online.  There are no refunds.  Apparently NYE is always a slow night.  It is also a shorter night, something they do not advertise until you walk into the park.  It closes an hour earlier that usual.  They should post that on the website, my kids were crushed.  Oh well....I donated a lot of money to SEF this year....maybe they can use it to fix some of these problems and bring all the rides back?  I hope this post helps someone else and the info gets to the owners!"
Enjoyable but Expensive,December 2018,30,Santa's Enchanted Forest,zivfam,If you plan to go once as a family the cost of admission/rides/food/drink can be expensive. It’s actually more cost effective for a family to purchase the “annual pass” and attend several times over the open dates. Our teenage daughter thoroughly enjoyed her visits! Beware of crowds at the park and long lines at the more popular rides the closer you get to Christmas.
relaxing!!,December 2016,30,Kennedy Park,lalocadr19,"This park has volleyball area and few workout machines, view of the marina, access to the down load boats. No fee for park"
Great Family Park,December 2016,50,Kennedy Park,Fastsailor,"Kennedy park is a wonderful bayside park in Coconut Grove. Great place for a stroll with your spouse, family or pet."
What a beautiful place,January 2017,40,Kennedy Park,allen94,"We enjoyed a walk through Kennedy park on our last day in Miami. It was very relaxing and a great place to walk, run or ride a bike."
Relaxing fun park in great location,March 2017,50,Kennedy Park,Marilyn K,"Just outside the intercontinental Miami, on the bay and next to Bayshore Mall. Lots of green space , dog walkers, joggers, outdoor classes like Yoga, it's a fun and beautiful venue to enjoy . Right on the bay with great view of the cruise ships, sailboats, and Miami skyline. Easy walk to outdoor mall with some shops and fun restaurants. "
Dangerous Shared-Use Bike Path,December 2017,20,Kennedy Park,mzbmiamiUSA,"I met my girlfriend for a one hour walk at Kennedy Park yesterday. We often walk together but never before at this location. While the park was very pretty, walking there was very unpleasant because bicyclists and pedestrians share the same space!! We kept having to stop and move to the side as bicyclists called to us from behind ""Coming on the Left"" ""Coming on the right"". this happened so often that we cut our walk short and left. How is it possible to expect walkers and children in strollers to be side by side with moving vehicles?? Very dangerous!"
walk through the park,March 2018,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,StelaParties,Shaded entryway did not give away the beauty and sunshine that would greet me as I went deeper into the park.  Lovely place to sit and contemplate the beauty.
Hidden Gem in the Grove,May 2018,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,Howard K,"Right on Biscayne Bay this historic state park is surrounded but almost a tropical forest and the water.  Original houses from the founding days  of Coconut Grove.  This well maintained public space is staffed by EXPERTS on the history of the park, and of the surrounding community.  They offer movies at night, picnics, dog-centric events, music concerts.  Don't miss this gem!"
Learn about the early history of Miami,June 2018,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,davidoH2706NF,"The park ranger gives daily guided tours of the house conducted at 10:00 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:00 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. Tickets are purchased at the gift shop; $3.00 for ages 13 and up. $1.00 ages 6-12. Ages 5 and under free. If the gift shop is closed you may have to look for the range doing maintenance around the grounds of the park."
Great experience!!!,September 2017,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,COLUSATRAVELER,The barnacle is the center point of history for early Biscayne Bay life in the Coconut Grove area. It exudes the feeling of the pioneer culture of the late 1800's so much that you can imagine being there at that time. The view of the bay is beautiful at this location as is the view from the bay on to the property. This place is a great starting point to learn about early Miami Pioneer heritage for both locals and travelers.
Florida State Park Junior Ranger Badge!,September 2018,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,Tofurry,"My son collects Junior Ranger badges and although this isn't a national park, they had a Florida State Park one which he was happy to collect! He printed out and completed the packet prior to us leaving for our cruise so he just had to turn it in.The park rangers in the office were very nice; they gave him the badge and took him out to see the house of Mr. Munroe. Great historic site!"
Complete waste of time !!!! thank you to lady in cultural centre for use of  toilet !,February 2017,10,Little Haiti,Phillip O,Trip advisor family groupings do not cover our group Mother and Adult Daughter !
Nothing interesting to see,March 2017,20,Little Haiti,etisarah,"Disappointed about this area of Miami, maybe I havent been to the good places but it's far away to reach by bus from the city center. It's probably more interesting in case of any events that could happen there."
Cultural visit,May 2017,40,Little Haiti,John d,We worked in Haiti for 4 years.  The people are the best in the world.  The sinbad hotel is great and the food is delicious.  Loved the cultural center and it is very safe to walk around at night
"Experience vibrant art, culture and cuisine",April 2017,50,Little Haiti,Guillermo F,"To immerse in its cultural life I would recommend two amazing places to get you out of the ordinary. The first Yo Space (294 NE 62nd St). A communal arts space where artists of different mediums can exhibit, work and collaborate all under one roof.  The second Moksha Family Artist Collective, a mixed use space bringing together musicians, artists, technicians, visionaries and creative individuals of all kinds, on the “quest for universal oneness.” This psychedelic space holds a variety of events, including live painting, video art, tribal music and electronic music."
Little Haiti,May 2017,20,Little Haiti,Purpleladyranae,Very run down. Truly no unique shopping. Spend your time in Little Havana. Great restaurant's  and felt very safe in Little Havana. Don't waste your time.
Beautiful building,December 2016,50,Coral Gables City Hall,Tatianaalva7,I like to come here because everybody is helpful and kind.  It's a well maintained old building.  I love the big Christmas tree they put in the front on December
Good Building,December 2016,40,Coral Gables City Hall,Johnlobster,Went here on our miami tour. This is a really beautiful building in a very classy upmarket district.
One Of A Number Of Interesting Buildings,March 2017,40,Coral Gables City Hall,Oldjack,Coral Gables has a number of interesting older buildings and the City Hall is one of them.The area around City Hall and along the Miracle Mile is a very pleasant part of Miami and one of the better locations visited.
beautiful historic building,December 2016,40,Coral Gables City Hall,madiestan,"this is at the end of the miracle mile stratt and worthy of a look, albeit for the historical elemtant and being a beautiful building"
Definitely an architectural masterpiece!,September 2017,50,Coral Gables City Hall,ARodriguezP,"Though not considered a popular tourist attraction the Coral Gables city hall is a perfect example of Mediterranean Revival architecture,a style used extensively in what's known as ""the city beautiful"". Since it's prominently located at the west end of the shopping area of Miracle Mile and visitors are bound to pass by it at some point or another I would strongly suggest taking the time to snap a few pictures and marvel at the details of this architectural masterpiece. In my opinion it's one of the Miami area's most beautiful public buildings and fits in perfectly with the area's homes,public areas and other significant buildings such as the nearby Colonnade and Biltmore Hotel. "
A memorable family adventure!,December 2015,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Shelly M,"My husband and I took our two kids, ages 2 and 5, for a tour and up close view of the animals.  We had a wonderful guide named Ashley, who spent 2 hours walking us around introducing us to the animals and sharing their stories.   We met and pet a 7 month old zebra, donkey, and miniature pony.  We viewed an alligator, panther, and several monkeys.  My kids not only got to ride horses for the first time, but participated in feeding, brushing, and tacking.  It was life-changing and incredibly ten minutes down the road from where we were staying.  I'm thrilled my children had such a special first riding experience.  They definitely gained a strong appreciation of animals after spending much of the year living in the city.  Jesse was enthusiastic and extremely welcoming."
Good but not enough ,April 2016,30,Jesse Williams Ranch,estebantautiva,"the children had a great time on the farm, they enjoyed it and were very happy, but it was a little bit expensive for what they did"
Excellent,June 2016,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Riccardo C,my family went to Jesse Ranch without any advise and Mr Jesse showed us all animals. my son love the ranch and we'll return again surely
very nice time,August 2016,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,Ari G,"thanks for having us over, the course was very professional and enjoyable expirience, im happy to call jesse a friend, thanks for the tour"
Best birthday party ever !,November 2016,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,MyOdyssey2001,"Had my daughter's 8 birthday there with 30 kids ranging from 8 to 12. The staff and Jesse were amazing.  The kids loved the horseback riding. When it started raining I thought it would get cut short or put a damper on the fun but no such thing.  They had tents covering the 4 tables thus food and guests were covered. The kids were entertained in the barn and every time the rain tapered off the fun continued with the animal exhibit, zebra, Florida panther, lemurs, emu, and more.  The haystack piñata was a hit and way more fun than the traditional one. The fun lasted 3.5 hours and could have gone on longer if the weather was better.  To quote the the 30 children and their parents ""this was the best party ever""."
It has changed a lot,July 2017,30,CocoWalk,J584FLstephaniem,Very sad. Came with some friends so they would see the area and I'm kind of embarrassed there's nothing to see. 
Nice Leisurely Stroll,August 2017,50,CocoWalk,Astros80,"We were in Miami on a layover and dropped down to Coconut Grove and took a stroll along Coco Walk.  Besides the nice dinner and drinks at Bice's Bistro, we enjoyed shopping at Maui Nix and bought a couple more items for our vaca. in Grand Cayman.  Nice, clean and quiet."
Awesome place,November 2017,50,CocoWalk,705rebeccam,"Lots of restaurants, little clothing boutiques, and a couple of chain stores like The Gap and Victoria Secret and Starbucks. Located in the heart of things and nightly entertainment live bands or DJ"
"Building Site Project, wait until completed",December 2017,10,CocoWalk,steve_xx,"Revisited following some amazing trips here in the past. This time wished I'd saved the gas money as Coco Walk is now down trodden, forlorn and lost. That said it does currently look like a building site as what looks like wholescale regeneration work is progressed. If you want to visit this area just for Coco Walk then I'd suggest you wait for the press announcement when this work is complete. Felt sorry for those few shops hanging in there amongst the scaffolding trying to survive and wait it out. Not a great visit."
Nothing to See Here,January 2018,20,CocoWalk,runaway2travel,Perhaps come back once completed and see what is to offer then.
At the beach in Surfside Fla,September 2019,50,Surfside Beach,squirt6024,"Going through a beach replenishment project. Was ok to use the beach and did a few days of snorkling until water became rough mid week. Able to wear ""thong"" style swim suits and take long walks in them along the beach. Not crowded and real nice time to be on vacation here. Great beach for reading and found some nice shells"
Just like the old days.,October 2019,50,Surfside Beach,Artislifetoday,Beautiful beach we used to surf years ago.  White sand so pleasant for a run or a walk.  Bring a friend!
Excellent beach,December 2019,50,Surfside Beach,lucycan,This is a wonderful wide sand beach.  Sand is super soft.  Right now they are working on a section of it.  Bringing in new sand and widening after years of erosion.
Excellent,December 2019,50,Surfside Beach,luvlife23,What a beautiful beach. Beach was clean and the water was blue...what more can one ask for? It was perfect. 
Blue beach and soft sand,December 2019,40,Surfside Beach,nursiej1,Surfside is a great area for relaxing.  
Theatre Nostalgia,September 2017,50,Olympia Theater,carmen6233,The theatre was restored and is a beautiful elegant venue with great performances and multi cultural events!
Attended Miami Film Festival,March 2018,50,Olympia Theater,whatsbeyondmyhorizon,"What a hidden gem in Miami. If visiting Miami, stop and catch a concert or movie. Worth the trip. Beautiful decor and a little piece of Miami history!"
Great Theatre more of a high school performance ,August 2018,30,Olympia Theater,jlpetersjr0920,The design of the theatre was amazing. We were expecting a professional showcase but it was more of a high school play. All except for Quasimodo. 
Postmodern Jukebox tour Spring 2019,April 2019,50,Olympia Theater,NickC203,The decor is incredible inside and outside the auditorium and well worth a visit when you're in the area 
Stunning Old World Theater in The Heart of Downtown Miami,August 2019,50,Olympia Theater,humbertoluisalvarez,"Gem of a theater in the heart of downtown Miami dating back 100 years. Originally designed as a theater for silent films.  The theater now hosts an array of musical performances, plays, film festivals, and comedy shows. Exquisite architecture and interior designs featuring red velvet theater seating and Moorish inspired hand-painted moldings and arches throughout. Highly recommended. "
Old building,March 2019,30,Coral Gables Museum,moonshinerkey,"Parking is across the street in parking garage and the museum doesn't have any conection so it is pay to park. The man on the desk was british and not the least bit friendly or knowledgeable about parking, also didn't offer information unless asked specific questions. Interesting displays."
"Felt unwelcomed, left.",April 2019,10,Coral Gables Museum,Mar A,"Please choose a more open-minded, friendlier person for Front  Desk, someone with a vocation for hospitality who will not act insulting when asked questions. In which case I’d return to enter and see the collection with my guests from abroad. THANKS!"
Visionary Museum in the City Beautiful,June 2019,50,Coral Gables Museum,Annalisad65,"This past Thursday evening, I visited the marvelous Coral Gables Museum in order to attend the opening of its most recent photography exhibit, The Art of Compassion. This incredibly meaningful and human project celebrates women who have traditionally lived in the shadows - formerly incarcerated women who are re-entering society. Curated by photographer and producer Starr Sariego, these powerful photographs provide insight in to the lives of formerly incarcerated women, more than 80% of whom were victims of childhood trauma. I highly recommend seeing this important exhibit and applaud Coral Gables Museum for showcasing it. I wish I had seen several other exhibits that this fine, visionary museum has offered in the past. Next door to Book & Books, a favorite spot for most everyone in Miami, Coral Gables Museum is located in the heart of the City Beautiful on Aragon Avenue. It is a historically designated architectural gem featuring the typical Mediterranean Revival of downtown Coral Gables but with elements of Depression Moderne as well. Coral rock in construction, it served as a police and fire station in the past hence the sculptures depicting Coral Gables firemen on its exterior in addition to decorative artwork. I didn't explore the entire museum complex during this visit, so I plan to return and take a proper guided tour and participate in its downtown walking tours. Lauded for its culturally relevant exhibits and celebration of the civic arts, Coral Gables Museum is a must-see. I've been to its delightful gift shop several times to purchase one-of-a-kind cards and several other eclectic gift items. It's the ideal spot to shop if you need to pick up something for the person who has everything. There's ample parking with a garage across the street as well as metered street parking. If you are as guilty as I am for not visiting this grand museum sooner, head over there today and enjoy a splendid afternoon!"
Must see,July 2019,50,Coral Gables Museum,Luckydog17,We very much enjoyed this museum and the ability to interact with the museum directors 
GREAT Gables Walking Tour with Juan,October 2019,50,Coral Gables Museum,earthworm3,"Excellent walking tour of Coral Gables through the city museum. We had no idea there were so many triangle buildings or where the huge mural of the Gables in the 20s was located. Tour is definitely recommended. Our tour guide is a historian & knew so many interesting facts about Gables, South Florida, & the state. We even joined the museum because of this tour."
Huge castle ,February 2019,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,Teakwo23,A giant sand castle awaits you when you enter. Lots of picnic benches and shelters. Huge play ground for kids. 
Virginia Key,April 2019,40,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,387indy,"Virgina Key is a beautiful historic beach. The park has parking, tan sand so bring bug spray. They have walking and bike pathes. The facilities are maintained."
Fun Times,May 2019,30,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,L5708EWlauras,"The beach is not as sandy as I would have liked it, you can walk for half a block into the water just watch for the seaweed on the bottom and the jet skiers on the top!"
Natural Beach,October 2019,50,Historic Virginia Key Beach Park,everythinglinda,I was surprised at how much sea glass I was able to find.  Lots of coral and shells to collect.  Nice walk along the beach or walk the nature trails.

BEST MUSEUM ON SOUTH BEACH,September 2019,50,Art Deco Museum,Rebecca M,"I am a resident of Miami and decided to visit a local museum. The Art Deco Museum taught me a lot about MB architecture and history, they also have temporary exhibits with local art which I thought was a nice touch! Definitely recommend!!"
Free to enter with hop on hop off ticket.,December 2019,40,Art Deco Museum,K254CFtimp,"Was looking forward to visiting this museum and enjoyed what was there to see, however it was a much smaller exhibition than I expected, but what was there is interesting and fun to see with a special word for the gift shop which has some fun  stuff and at reasonable value. An enjoyable, if short visit."
Big Store,November 2019,30,Target,Thomas V,"This is just a big department store with a large grocery section, so it's a practical place to buy what you need.  Well organized."
DAVID CASTILLO GALLERY: NOT TO BE MISSED,November 2018,50,David Castillo Gallery,garyknight,"Despite the other review posted here, David Castillo is one of the most thoughtful, revered, and respected gallery owners in South Florida. His is one of the few galleries invited to participate in Art Basel, and the artists he represents are all excellent young to mid career contemporary artists who have established careers as well. David's academic pedigree is extremely strong, yet he remains a true gentleman and his opinions and recommendations are taken very seriously by art collectors and enthusiasts. However, persons visiting his gallery expecting it to be some kind of tourist destination (it's not)  should know that this is the same kind of first class gallery one could find in any major city around the world."
Interesting place in Little Havana,June 2018,40,Bay of Pigs Museum,Heather K,"I know this place gets lots of mixed reviews on various travel websites.  However, we got lucky on our stop.  We were given a guided tour of this small place by an actual veteran of the Bay of Pigs Battle.  Very interesting but tiny place.  Worth stopping if you want to learn information and see artefacts that are not in any US history book!"
Amazing history,August 2018,50,Bay of Pigs Museum,Dan W,"The Bay of Pigs museum was an incredible experience.  We had several hours  after our cruise and before our flight, so we checked it out.  Saddled with all of our luggage, we were greeted by our tour guide, who invited us to leave our bags in the lobby.  This is a free museum of Bay of Pigs artifacts, proclamations and pictures.  Our experience was led by one of the soldiers who lived it and then survived as a POW for 2+ years, in Cuba, after the invasion… very moving.  The stories were riveting and our time there was well worth the trip into Little Havana.  As we said good bye, we were invited back anytime, because, “we are all now friends for life.”  Please check it out- it is so special... you won't find this history anywhere else."
Small but worthwhile ,February 2019,50,Bay of Pigs Museum,Wombling_Free_7548,Plenty of street parking nearby.
Personal account of events,July 2019,50,Bay of Pigs Museum,Charlotte V,"This museum is very small and I, at first, thought it would be an extremely short visit. I was wrong: there’s a good (although for some a bit too-detailed) informational video to catch you up to speed with events surrounding the Bay of Pigs invasion. Carlos Leon then offered to give us a personal account of his experience as a soldier and subsequent imprisonment. It was a mesmerizing story that made history come alive. It helped our teenagers understand the significance of what happened (and didn’t happen). We also talked to J.R. Lopez de la Cruz, the museum president, and Dr. Eduardo Zayass-Bazán. Professor Emeritus at East Tennessee State University who has written a book on the subject. A fantastic experience for us. Thank you! "
An Important part of Cuban History,September 2019,30,Bay of Pigs Museum,Andrew M,"Other nearby attractions include Domino park, Walk of fame and the many f&b offerings."
Do not miss! ,February 2019,50,de la Cruz Collection,CSSnowshoer,"If you have any interest in contemporary art, this is a great stop. The collection is not comprehensive, they buy what they like, but in many cases there were multiples of an artist so you could really study them. Big space, nice light. If there are not many visitors, the docents will walk you around and talk about the art. "
A stunning collection ,March 2019,50,de la Cruz Collection,Ian C,"In 2016, ArtNews listed Rosa and Carlos de la Cruz in their worldwide survey of the ""Top 200 Collectors""."
A whimsical art collection,February 2019,40,de la Cruz Collection,ReviewerToronto,"The De La Cruz Collection is difficult to find as there are no signs of the gallery on the street. It is located next door to the Institute of Contemporary Art, in the Design District. The entrance is in an alcove to the west. Admission is free. The collection transcends many forms of contemporary art with a relevance to the current day. The exhibits include works by both world famous and lesser known, but expressive artists. We enjoyed our visit and would recommend the De La Cruz Contemporary Art Collection to other art aficionados. "
Amazing!,May 2019,50,de la Cruz Collection,nairbnocam,"My wife and I came to Miami to watch a baseball game. I wanted to take her to see some of Miami’s art and culture and we stumbled upon this amazing museum. We spent at least two hours reading about the artists being showcased and viewing some of their pieces of work, What else do you expect to do and a museum right? Multiple times a staff member would come by and ask if we had questions. A few staff members even took time to explain some of the art and the history behind the pieces from the artists perspective. As we were leaving, coming down the elevator from the third floor, we actually got to meet the owners Rosa and Carlos de la Cruz and chat with them for a few minutes! What a great museum. A must see!"
Worth seeing even if you are not particularly into contemp art,November 2019,50,de la Cruz Collection,scott r,"The building itself is an impressive space, well suited to the scale of several oversize installations.  Museum entrance hidden - essentially unmarked -  in a courtyard on the left side of the building - the idea is that one rings the bell as though one were visiting a private residence.  As with all contemporary art (my opinion) some of it is self-indulgent - the artist and thier reviewers believing their own press.  Some of it derivative - and some of it is thought provoking.  Most of it is interesting.  At least, and at best, contemporary art does not shy away from a social point of view.  I ended up with what amounted to a private tour / walking commentary from one of the employees - whether he took an interest in my interest or functioned as a sort of security was never quite clear.  But he stayed with me througout, and had a good knowledge of the particular artists, items, installations - and art itself; we spend time discussing various collections we'd both visited - and ranged from Monet to Turner.  It did add to the experience.  Fascinating that this was all collected and funded by one gentleman and his wife, still collecting and - one assumes - still fabulously wealthy.  Most remarkable of all - it's free!  (Applause to the de la Cruz family; what a nice give back)"
We had a blast with the kids,November 2019,40,Santa's Enchanted Forest,peter H,"We have been 2 times once when the kids were much younger and last year now their almost teens , we had a blast with the kids their were plenty of good rides lots of food  and a lot to do , we dunked the clown and won some big stuffed animals , it’s all about family for us I don’t mind spending the extra money once a year to laugh and make great memories with the kids we are thankful this fair shows up every year it gives us something extra to do in south Florida , we are going again tonight can’t wait we make the best of it"
Gross and unenchanted,November 2019,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,anagmomof3,Just an overpriced carnival. Parking a nightmare. An ear of corn $9. Nothing pretty about it.Low end rides and masses of rude people. Not beautiful scenery at all.
Extremely expensive ,December 2019,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,latinlover12344,The enchanted forest of Santa ridiculously expensive and nothing fun !!! The employees are very rude 
Waste of money,December 2019,20,Santa's Enchanted Forest,Linda F,Bought express pass to avoid the lines and on the pass it guarantees less than 15 minutes wait when in reality we waited a whole hour for just one ride. Worst part is when I wrote to Santa’s Enchanted Forest about the bad experience they did not respond or get back to me. Very disappointed with their service.
Unsafe Ballerina!!,December 2019,10,Santa's Enchanted Forest,933lourdesr,"I was excited at the begining because the beautiful entrance, places to take photos and food everywhere BUT the ballerina is so speedy that I got 2 bruises, they don't take safety precautions  on this ride...never more!"
A central park in the district of Miraflores.,November 2018,50,Kennedy Park,moreiraj17,"A wonderful space for walking in well mantained gren park,and cultural activities for all ages, local artists, arts and crafts from all over Peru. It's clean and safe, in the evening, musical groups present for free to entertain visitors."
Sunday Funday,January 2019,50,Kennedy Park,yourhelpfulfoodie,My favorite park!!! I can go everyday if I lived closer. It has everything you need to have a relax and active time. It has a running path which has different stops for you to do some exercises and they even have signs to tell you what you can do and for how long. It has a playground. It's a dog-friendly park. It's great to take pictures and perfect for picnics. Keep walking and you can see the beautiful coconut grove bay. Right one the parking lot you can find the famous lemonade truck which is very well known for how fresh and good are the lemonades.
Running ,November 2019,50,Kennedy Park,960willemk,Loved this park while staying a mile away. Perfect soft pathways. I enjoyed doing my runs here smelling the ocean.
Sunset stroll ,November 2019,40,Kennedy Park,LollysLook,"Kennedy Park is a nice green park to enjoy the outdoors with shaded areas, and views of the water. We strolled through before happy hour. "
Morning walk,November 2019,40,Kennedy Park,norskies,"This park is a nice place to start the day with a morning walk.  The pathways were soft and nice to walk on.  There are other things to do here too, a dog park, exercise equipment, volleyball areas etc.  Another plus is that there are clean restrooms there."
Ho Hum,May 2019,30,Barnacle State Historic Site,irbflyfish,"I normally love the parks and other public spaces in the Miami area, but not this one.  It really was a dissapointment.  Nothing to see other than an old house."
A Must See If You Like History,November 2018,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,David A,"The house was beautifully restored, and it sits on a gorgeous piece of Biscayne Bay shoreline.  The guides are great --you truly get a sense of old Miami. It's wonderful it didn't fall prey to development like so much else of the Grove."
Relaxing visit!,August 2019,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,DC_diva_10,"Lovely space in the city, would recommend a visit. Check out special events as well, like movies in the park."
Low key history peek,June 2019,50,Barnacle State Historic Site,ElsieN99,Beautiful location to see what old Florida was like. The house is very well kept and the ground take you back to old Florida Close to lots of great places to eat and things to do. 
Interesting oasis in the middle of town,November 2019,40,Barnacle State Historic Site,scott r,"The park (short trail, really, wish there were more of it)  takes this to four stars rather than three.  The house itself is fine, the tour - another sole guest experience - is fine, but quite definately timed and you breeze by a lot of objects.  Call that the '3' portion of the experience.  On the plus side, the experience is nearly free, and a bargain for the 60-90 minutes you might spend.  The park clearly gets a lot of use for festivals, movie nights - they were setting up for one when I was there - nice for those local."
Nothing Here...Really,May 2018,20,Little Haiti,LovingLife39,"I went to Little Haiti today to do some touristy stuff. No happenings here! I visited the Little Haiti Cultural Center which is the same place as the Carribean Market. While the place is nice, it is by far NOT a marketplace. Not even like a flea market. There were a few vendors there, but nothing like advertised in ads. It's a very colorful, run down area. Most businesses were closed. There were only a few places open for business. The people in the area are NOT friendly is you don't speak Creole, even if you're Black. Lower your expectations. Saturday is the best day to go visit. Otherwise, don't waste your time unless there is a special event in the area. Even then, choose wisely."
Small piece of Haiti ,May 2019,40,Little Haiti,StephenCr0ss,"We travel to Haiti a lot and this is nothing like Haiti. That said, you can get a Prestige Beer here and it has a few things from Haiti. "
Interesting area of Miami,March 2019,50,Little Haiti,jaytee4349,"Visited Little Haiti in Miami and was quite impressed.  There is a central gathering place, which has Haitian music playing and people dancing.  It also had a small area of crafts and clothing.  There was a few stalls to purchase Haitian food with tables on the sidewalk.  The food was very good as well.  Interesting little area which would be of interest especially to those of Haitian background."

At the beginning of the Miracle Mile,September 2018,50,Coral Gables City Hall,619jeffry,"Coral Gables City Hall is a magnificent structure, it looks like a castle It's at the beginning of the Miracle Mile, a mile-long high-class collection of boutiques. bespoke dress shops and restaurants. The main instigator of this  Miracle Mile was George Merrick, who developed Coral Gables as one of the first planned communities in the United States."
Coral Gables City Hall is the heart of the City Beautiful!,July 2018,50,Coral Gables City Hall,thewrightsights,"This city was built in the 1920's and when visiting City Hall you feel like you are back in the Roaring 20s!  I was so impressed that I put together a video on my Youtube channel at ""thewrightsights"".  Check out the history of this Beautiful City!"
1920's Spanish architecture in Coral Gables--beautiful,November 2018,50,Coral Gables City Hall,Ray A,"I grew up in Miami, and know this building well. It's one of the architectural highlights of Coral Gables, the Miami suburb which is famous for its elegant homes, the fantastic Biltmore Hotel, and this City Hall. The City of Coral Gables was one man's dream, and he developed it in the roaring twenties, which were really roaring in Miami. Everything in Coral Gables today is Spanish in style, including the names of all the streets, etc., which feature fountains and plazas at all major intersections. (The City Hall is directly on LeJeune Road and Coral Way, so it's easy to find.) Most all the vintage houses in Coral Gables are also in the elegant Mediterranean style, with beautiful ornaments, fountains,and courtyards. It's all because that style was all the rage in the 1920's--at the same time the early movie stars in Hollywood were building similar-styled mansions. One of the most fascinating things about the City Hall is that the oolitic limestone (which we always called ""Coral Rock"") was quarried from a place in the city nearby.  And then the quarry was turned into another Coral Gables landmark, magnificent Venetian Pool, a huge municipal swimming pool built in Venetian style architecture, with an island, restaurant, and tall palm trees. Don't know if you can tour the City Hall these days, but don't miss Venetian Pool!  "
Worth a Look,May 2019,40,Coral Gables City Hall,David B,Another interesting piece of Old Coral Gables architecture well worth at least a look.  The Coral Gables Farmers Market is held nearby on Saturdays in season.
"A Beautiful Landmark in ""The City Beautiful""",June 2019,50,Coral Gables City Hall,TheBestOnly_13,"Built in 1928,  it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Coral Gables City Hall houses the Mayor's Office, City Commission, Building Department and other City offices. Well maintained as is the entire City of Coral Gables. "
Your kids will love it!,October 2018,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,SoniaMaltina,"Chris is amazing, my son talked for weeks after riding one of the horses. His expressions of happiness is something I will never forget. I will definitively come back once he is bigger. Their riding lessons are fun and they really teach you well about horses."
Welcome to the family,March 2019,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,schiccjl,- Learning how to care for the animals
An Awesome Experience!,April 2019,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,FredaMina,No question the quality of the experience exceeded my expectations.
Just a wonderful & unforgettable experience!!!,April 2019,50,Jesse Williams Ranch,donnavalle,"My daughter and I arrived at the ranch on my birthday not knowing what to expect. When we met Jessie and he found out it was my B day he turned this visit into something that I can't put into words how very incredible this experience was for us! I walked the sweet horses into their stalls, fed them, pet them and that wasn't it. We got to walk around to see all the other amazing animals that live on the ranch. The gorgeous zebra, donkey, panthers, lemurs, ostrich and so much more. It's like going to the zoo but sooooooo much more. Don't hesitate to out and meet everyone on that ranch. You will have an unforgettable experience for sure!!!"
Jesse Williams Ranch,September 2019,40,Jesse Williams Ranch,387indy,"Jesse Williams Ranch is SW of Miami, lots of things for kids to see and do. There are farm animals and horses for them to ride."
Nothing open,March 2019,10,CocoWalk,mjp315,We were disappointed to find Cocowalk under renovation with almost nothing but the Gap and the movie theater open.  
Mostly closed,April 2019,30,CocoWalk,StephenCr0ss,Seems to be dying a death and nothing exciting about the area. Sad to see the area slide into decline. Not recommended.
Under renovation ,May 2019,10,CocoWalk,Sammi C,"Be noted that it’s under renovation, nothing is in business except GAP & the cinema !!! Heard that it will take a year before it’s back to business ... "
Great place to shop and relax!,April 2019,40,CocoWalk,Roberto M,"I visit Coco Walk on every opportunity at least once every trip to Miami. It is a very nice place to walk and shop, dine or just have a good time."
Everything was in disarray,October 2019,20,CocoWalk,JudeH79,"Was disappointed as the mall with Fat Tuesday looking out over the walk was completely demolished with new construction going on.  We did have an excellent lunch at one of the restaurangs there so it wasn't a bust, just not what we expected."
Beautiful Botanic Garden,September 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,ubojct55555,"I glanced at some the pictures on here and decided it was worth a look. I'm glad I took a look, because it's very nice. We live so close and I'm a veteran so I get in free so I think I may buy my wife a year pass so we can go for walks and runs there. The grounds are very nice and makes for a very relaxing 2 hour walk with beautiful views."
Extensive garden..go visit during..,December 2018,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,tymetraveler222,Highly recommend!
A True Hidden Gem ,October 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,mlitterio,We are members of Fairchild Garden for years. First time my son visited the butterfly house he was 6 yo and we had just moved to the US. That moment was able to make him so happy and motivated to keep exploring his new life in Miami! We bring our friends to visit the park and they all fall in love. People in general is not aware of such nice place in the south of Miami. It’s a real hidden gem ready to be found. 
fairchild,September 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,leslie p,unique place.beautiful gardens with many rare and exotic plants and trees.. guided tours are very informative. lovely cafe for lunch
Beautiful Photography,December 2018,50,National Geographic Fine Art Galleries,Jemom68,Stunning. This gallery was a really fun find on Lincoln Road for us. I follow Nat Geo on insta and it was amazing to see those photos close up. 
Live nearby and am there many times a month,December 2012,50,Miami Beach Latin Chamber of Commerce,Bella W,"The people, especially the director, Grace, are lovely friendly people. They are a great resource all around, but the Visitor Center aspect is second to none. Up to date maps, public transport maps, coupons as good as can be found on-line regularly, though not with Groupon for example, for pretty much any attraction imaginable in S. Florida. Racks of info are neatly arranged, copious and well-updated. The staff will help, or simply allow you privacy if you don't approach - very comfortable to just walk in and browse or get friendly advice and info."
Fresh brunch,May 2019,50,Upper Buena Vista,edithg157,"We visited a Sunday around noon the restaurant for brunch. It was full of people so we had to wait for a table. The place is open, with a beautiful tree in the middle of the park, good attention and good food. We had toast with avocado and eggs, omelets and quinoa salad with juice and a mimosa. It is expensive but you have to visit at least once. A different brunch experience."
Unique and fun,May 2019,50,Upper Buena Vista,Ebok76,Also shop for vintage clothing and be sure to wrap a ribbon around the wish tree
Aquasino should have stayed in Miami,July 2013,20,Aquasino,jostar314,Thought it would be fun - it sort of was - maybe for free but not for $33 per person!
Blistered Feet,October 2016,40,Melissa Shoes USA,Angie T,Customer Service is Five Star!!! I purchased an emergency pair of shoes. The ladies were sweet and very helpful!
Very colorful!,September 2019,50,Miami Beach Welcome Mural,JosePenaA8201,"Painted by Lebo, a Cuban artist, by the end of 2016. It is the largest mural approved by Miami Beach District (50 ft high and 120 feet long)."
Always Something New,August 2016,50,Blank Canvas Gallery,Shelly531,"I have been to the Blank Canvas Gallery several times.  They constantly add to their Offerings and have interesting and diverse events, like the recent Harley Davidson event.  The people at the gallery are friendly and helpful.  They make you feel at home rather than an a necessary intruder which sometimes occurs at other galleries for the ""Art Uneducated"" like me."
Love it,September 2017,50,Ermita de la Caridad,162cesarv,I love I always wanted to go to to visit a La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre in Santiago de Cuba but I never knew that in Miami there was a church of the La Virgen de la Caridad I went to visit her
Pray and be thankful ,December 2017,40,Ermita de la Caridad,Mary_LivinofftheLand,One of the most important church in town for Cuban community. La virgen de la caridad del cobre is the principal god for the Cubans so it is the place where we pray for family and friends. It is small but very peaceful. There are a beatiful ocean view outside and the parking is free. You should buy the girasoles before enter in the church!! 
Pray and be thankful ,September 2018,50,Ermita de la Caridad,Futbolking,"The Ermita de la Caridad del Cobre is a small but well-visited church. On September 7 and 8 of each year, the church is packed with parishioners. I warn you parking on those days parking is a very slow process. The Caridad del Cobre Church is a symbol in the Cuban community since she is Cuba’s Patron and all those traveling and seeking freedom via the ocean in a raft always ask for her blessings. The mural in the altar is impressive to me one of the most beautiful and well painted murals I ever seen. The back of the church faces the bay and there is an outside shrine for praying. Definitely, a place for praying and for being thankful."
La Caridad ,November 2018,50,Ermita de la Caridad,ncmtnpadre,"Wonderful little, unassuming shrine. Peaceful location amidst the bustle of Miami. Right on the water. The Blessed Sacrament Chapel is simple and prayerful. The main church is filled with the spectacular mural. The gift shop was a little gem."
A moving and spiritual place ,February 2019,50,Ermita de la Caridad,Ian C,Outside the shrine are a number of statues including a modern interpretation of the virgin by the Cuban sculptor Antuan in 2008.
How could you not love UMF??,March 2018,50,Ultra Music Festival,PipNgn,One of the biggest festivals in the world with so many famous DJs playing on many different stages! It’ll never be enough to any ravers! UMF is like dreams come true to all ravers! How could you not love this place???
Adrienne Arsht Center,December 2018,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,387indy,"Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts is a beautiful venue, nice facilities, nice décor, parking, good staff. We have seen good shows, 'Hello Dolly' with Betty Buckley, Jerry Seinfeld."
Miranda Curtis Concert,January 2019,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,755gladysc,"The venue is an awesome place for a concert the staff is courteous and very very helpful, our group had an awesome time."
Visited Les Miserables; great experience,February 2019,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,DutchyTrAd,It's a 15 minute walk from Bayside marketplace if you want to combine the two.
Great cultural landmark in Miami,January 2019,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,travelguys1015,The Arsht Center is the hub of the South Florida Arts scene.  We were lucky enough to tour the facility as well as attend a play in the adjacent Ziff Opera House.  First class customer service and quality performance.  I would highly recommend putting on short list when visiting Miami
national broadway show in beautiful theater,February 2019,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Mindy R,Parking across the street is $15 but fills up quickly
Best Festival of my Life,March 2018,50,Ultra Music Festival,AllieW181,"Absolutely insane energy at this festival from friday to sunday. So many good looking and happy+friendly people all around, it was just a pleasure and an honor to be part of this year's UMF. Swedish House Mafia's closing set was the best, 10/10 points."
Sanitation was awful and bathroom situation terrible pee flooded the the ground,March 2018,10,Ultra Music Festival,Joshua K,"This festival was priced as the best but in my opinion, it was far from it. The lines for the bathrooms were really long near the main stage. On the second day people were tired of waiting and ended up peeing against the walls the whole area was flooded with pee! The smell was terrible. Many of the stalls were out of toilet paper and all of them were out of sanitizer. I went with a group of 7 friends and all of us returned home puking. I've been to spring awakening, moonrise, edc Orlando, and lost lands but I paid the most for Ultra by far the worst when it comes to sanitation and organization. I was even warned by the people at EDC that the people that go to ultra do not understand PLUR and now I get it. The lineup made up for it but it seems like they don't give it as much effort as they could setting up the fest. Not worth the money IMO."
Ultra Music Festival a once in a lifetime experience.,March 2018,50,Ultra Music Festival,Czar_Abram,Be open to discover new music and new artist and above all to make new friends from around the globe.
Nothing else is like it,March 2018,50,Ultra Music Festival,Shayne O,"Yes, there are bathroom issues: most aren't clean (especially by day 3) and the hand wash pumps are basically out of order by day 2, but I never had trouble finding a port o potty if needed. Those sorts of experiences are par for the course with a huge festival like this."
Great little spot of GREEN!,May 2015,50,Margaret Pace Park,stacieb541,"Great, safe part of downtown Miami.  Cute little playground, a workout space & yes...dogs.  It's not considered a ""dog park"", but they need fresh air too. A lot of evening yoga classes available & just a breath of fresh air when in the city.  Nice place to sit along Biscayne Bay!"
ok park. good sand volleyball courts,September 2015,30,Margaret Pace Park,P_J121611,there is some construction in the park and the homeless problem is still there. ok place to visit during the day to walk your dog.  it does have good sand volleyball courts.
Well used and dog friendly park,September 2015,30,Margaret Pace Park,Stephen U,"I wanted to a walk near the hotel and stumbled on to this park, nothing grand or special but it was a good place to kill some time and enjoy the diversity of Miami.  A few neat places within walking distance and that made it even more pleasant."
Beatiful ocean view,December 2015,30,Margaret Pace Park,Miamismith305,"This park is located near Wynwood Walls and it has a pet area. Great view and lots of space to exercise, the only downfall is that one might find homeless people sleeping there."
Off leash dog park,May 2013,50,Margaret Pace Park,jay10012,Beautiful off leash park. All size dogs play together. Many locals. Clean park. BBQ. Water fountains
"Dogs, recreation and the homeless",June 2013,50,Margaret Pace Park,Patrick A,"This was a great place to hang out while my wife was doing her convention.  There are various sporty things to do, a playground for kids, places to sit and watch the dogs and the water.  The homeless take up much of the seating in the morning.  They did not interact with me nor seem to bother the numerous people coming and going.  Most of the litter was cleaned up regularly, though it was amazing the amount of trash that did not get into the many trash cans. Not big enough for a jog, unless you circle it.  Not good for biking at all, too crowded."
Great theater AVOID Valet,May 2018,30,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,bianca a,"Great shows, beautiful theater, wonderful service but avoid the valet. Had to wait 45 minutes, $25, and had VERY rude tenants. The manager is destroying that part of the show experience."
Que Pasa USA?,May 2018,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,487cynthiav,"A must see theatrical performance, hilarious, it’s nonstop humor. It will definitely take you back to your Cuban roots. Make sure to rent the season, beforehand if you have never watched this sitcom..that started 40 years ago. NYC and LA has to see this"
"Great theatre, but limited eating venues",January 2018,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Judy B,There are fantastic programs offered at the Arsht Center. I only wish that parking was better and there were more restaurant choices offered in the area. 
Do Not Waste Money On Valet,May 2018,30,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Yani M,We had a great night until we wanted to get home and ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes to get our car! The speaker where they shouted out the ticket numbers for the cars didn’t work. It was terrible. It was windy and rainy too. Then the rude valet told us “you aren’t going to tip?” (in Spanish) before we could even take any money out. We didn’t tip after that. Not only did we waste extra money to park but we ended up spending more on baby sitting since we got home to late. Never again!!
Ticketing Fees Exhorbitant,April 2018,20,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,DavidBMIA,"I used to attend many more events at this venue. While it is pretty inside, there is really no suitable parking, with only a confusing inefficient valet process or overpriced gravel / dirt lots. Even more importantly, ticketing fees have now increased to 12% regardless of online or in person purchase. So for me, it's a goodbye to the Arsht Center - finding events elsewhere."
Incredible set up,March 2016,50,Ultra Music Festival,stephenkerr12,Amazing festival for those who love house! 
Awesome but super cold,February 2016,40,Ultra Music Festival,alexhJ7053IG,"Went to the one in Cape Town, it was freezing and the food stalls were far away, the music however was amazing and I had a great time!"
"Sold and priced as the best, far away from it. Should be called: Ultra 3 Days Music.",March 2016,20,Ultra Music Festival,Alberto S,"Ok Miami so ok it's expensive (more than 120$ a day, 8$ a beer 0.4L and 7$ a dry slice of pizza) but don't say it's the best EDM festival in the world. First it's not a festival, it's a 3 days music with a great line up (except for the most overrated dj, ahahah dj, David Guetta) and the awesome location in down town Miami among skyscrapers but the organization and the audio quality... please! Let's start with the organization: Miami in March, 40 degrees and you start it at noon? The temperature is fine from 6/7pm and the music finishes at midnight? We were almost more queuing than in the actual 'festival'. And now the audio. The very big down of the festival. Unless you go within 5 meters far and in front of the speakers the audio is like in my apartment parties listening music from the terrace, ok a bit exaggerating but you got an idea. If you want to go an proper EDM festival have a look at what happens in Zamardi, Hungary around June/July every year since 2006."
VIP biggest RIP OFF EVER!!! No bathrooms ,March 2016,10,Ultra Music Festival,adctd2onlnshpng,I don't think we will ever be back because they really left a bad taste in my mouth. We have gone to so many festivals and shows and we only do VIP. This is not VIP or nowhere near VIP for the $1500.00 price tag. They should fix that ! 
Ultra Miami,March 2017,10,Ultra Music Festival,seag8r,This is not a good Music festival. The crowds in Miami are gross . Its crowded and obnoxious. Lots of scam artists selling fake tickets. Beware!
Off leash dog park,June 2013,50,Margaret Pace Park,jay10012,Beautiful off leash park. All size dogs Play together. Access to the bay. Free Poop bags.  Dog friendly café right across the street.
Good place for every dog and excercise,August 2013,40,Margaret Pace Park,MasamiH,"Anyway, here is excellent place to play for an hour."
A great park with bad pet owners...,December 2013,40,Margaret Pace Park,29Teddy,"There is city planning talk about connecting Pace Park with downtown Miami via a boardwalk creating a waterfront pathway to the new museum complex, Bayfront,  and Claude Pepper Park.  Although this might change the neighborhood feeling of Pace Park, it would also make it easier to get downtown on foot without having to traverse blocks of concrete and crazy intersections."
So much potential ,October 2015,20,Margaret Pace Park,CityandColourful,This park has so much potential and a truly beautiful view. I used to live next door and you can't really go during the summer because the people who walk their dogs here let their dogs poo on the side walks even though there is a separate space for dogs but some people don't have respect for others and let their dogs poo anywhere and they don't feel obligated to pick it up. The smell from the hot sun hitting it is absolutely disgusting. You literally have to hopscotch around poo. The bay on the far right smells awful during the summer as well. There's also a significant problem with homeless people here. It wouldn't bother me except there are a few that are very clearly mentally unstable and have made me feel uneasy and unsafe with and without my child. 
POP ART,August 2015,50,Art By Mariano Picos Pelegri,IMLeonTerzi,"Colorful, and wonderful POP ART. Enjoyed this gallery very much. Had no time to buy anything but I do believe the prices were quite affordable."
Ultra Music Festival,March 2012,50,Ultra Music Festival,Cara P,This is where UMF 2012 was held.  It has great facilities and beautiful views.
Ultra Weekend,March 2012,40,Ultra Music Festival,FightOnTrojans5,"Overall, Ultra is a must if you like electronic music.  But I wish they would utilize Bayfront as well as parts of Bicentennial to make things more spread out."
Classy place,October 2017,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Mary_LivinofftheLand,"I went for the successful musical ""On your Feets"" by Emilio and Gloria Estefan. I loved the place. Beverages are overpriced, you could pay 15$ for a plastic shot of whiskey. Also, try to explore about parking before arrive. Remember it is downtown, a crazy spot for everything. The acoustic is amazing, the staff, everything is almost perfect."
Excellent Venue -- parking can be an issue,December 2017,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,KPboulder,"Go the the Arsht for shows you like -- it's very good.  But do not park at the Omni, it is a  disaster."
Watched Nutcracker Miami City Ballet ,December 2017,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Richard S,I have been here prior to performance of Nutcracker by Miami City Ballet. Great view inside. Scenic inside building and nice architecture of building and neighboring music hall. Dance and other performances here and across at Knight Concert Hall. Music and dance are entertainment in this area. Not far from the Frost Science Center.
"The most impolite audience you can imagine, please read on",January 2018,20,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,J B,Such behaviour is nowhere in Europe to be seen. Funny that many in the Miami audience try to show-off as well educated and highly behaved Europeans. What a joke.
Beautiful symphony hall.,January 2018,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,stevelotte,Once we got to our seats the view was wonderful.  Downsides - leaving from tier three you need to walk up 2 flights to go down the stairs or wait for the elevator.  Seats were comfortable and acoustics were excellent.
ULTRA FEST! And nice year-round,March 2013,50,Ultra Music Festival,Alanblizzard,Beautiful venue for the Ultra Music Fest held annually there. A bit of nightmare with traffic because they shut down half of Biscayne Blvd for the festival so be aware if you are an innocent bystander during the festival. Amazing city and harbors view.
A fun weekend,March 2016,40,Ultra Music Festival,Joshua W,"Had to wait in line on Saturday for almost 3 hours as we decided to go late, which was the worst idea ever. Since security doesn't allow outside liquids in, people in front of us were passing out from dehydration, in which we had to take care of the people ourselves. Incredibly poor oversight. With as many police officers and security guards around, it was pathetic that no one was around to help when we needed someone. Seems like everyone who worked there (including the police officers) were too busy talking to eachother."
First visit ,March 2016,50,Ultra Music Festival,LuxDres,"Super fun weekend, the line up for the main stage was great both Friday and Sunday. If you're thinking about going I'm just going to let you know the line just to get in is going to take you almost an hour. The festival was a lot of fun and already booking for next year. "
Wonderfully eclectic,January 2016,50,Art By Mariano Picos Pelegri,nyimagery,"What a wonderful and fascinating little shop to wander through, so may bright colorful art objects you can't help but smile."

"Beautiful, clean, calm, relaxing, delicious ",July 2019,50,Upper Buena Vista,Corti_3,"Food was delicious, great choices of wine, atmosphere impecable!"
Fabulous Arts Center,April 2017,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,barweb11,"This was our second visit to an event at the Arsht Center.  We saw ""Four: The Vivaldi Project"" a collaborative work between Decadancetheatre a hip  hop dance company and Nu Deco Ensemble a contemporary orchestra.  Amazing work that brought down the house."
Costly Outing,June 2017,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Ana B,"We are season ticket holders and Valet Park for all events and we have not had any issues until Saturdays event.   They were rushing us (we know why now) and we normally go around the car to make sure everything is in order but we did not this time.  Apparently one of the valets backed into another car or a post and damaged my rear bumper to the tune of $2,000+.   Remedies are non-existent at best.   Make sure not to allow them to rush you so you go around the vehicle before you leave the premises and note any damages."
"Carnival Studio Theater - fun ""Off Broadway"" venue!",June 2017,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Joe S,"A very fun and special evening - and very different than the ""big theater"" night out."
Great Venue,October 2017,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,rschagrin,"Beautiful performing arts Center , centrally located on Biscayne Blvd just north of downtown. Comprised of the Ziff Opera , Knight concert Hall and the Carnival Theater."
Sound system ,October 2017,30,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Ciaobella33,"Unless you are seated in the front rows, poor sound. The best seats in the house are in the Pit, or rows A to C."
Check This Area Out!,August 2019,50,Upper Buena Vista,AreWeHavingFunYet,"Unusual area, places to eat, interesting stores, amazing plants.  We wanted to eat at the restaurant but we were too early and it wasn't open yet.  (next time!).  Calm garden with beautiful trees and plants.  Not huge, but definitely worth a visit."
Getting to know Miami as local,October 2019,50,Upper Buena Vista,Elari2019,Very nice place. Family oriented. Lots of small peculiar boutiques with interesting merchandise. Very clean. Valet parking although we found parking in the street-meter parking. I would go again if I am around the area.
Great Service at Visitor Center in Lincoln Road,June 2015,50,Miami Beach Latin Chamber of Commerce,Charly M,"We had a great experience when visiting Miami Beach in June,this city is not only beautiful, it has has excellent service. Don't miss the Visitor Center at Lincoln Road,  their welcome and assistance was the best! The people who work there know what they are recommending. They offer free maps, guides and gave us excellent tips and plans on what to do and see, with road map directions and all. We plan to return and see them again. Head out to discover Miami after you visit them!"
Get Info Here,April 2016,50,Miami Beach Latin Chamber of Commerce,Gillian D,"Visit the Latin Chamber of Commerce to get info on what is happening and where to go in Miami Beach.  Friendly, informative staff will assist you with any question you may have regarding this beautiful city."
Available help,June 2017,50,Miami Beach Latin Chamber of Commerce,452mam,"We went by mistake to find out about maps of Miami, and found out that it was all in reference of employment and business yet, the staff was friendly and extended themselves to give us advice and maps for the area"
Great place to network your business!,November 2017,50,Miami Beach Latin Chamber of Commerce,shayshay321,Excellent variety of business people and a hub for networking your business for years!
"Beautiful gallery and artwork: Snotty, rude staff",December 2018,10,National Geographic Fine Art Galleries,yachtsmart,"I was the only person in the gallery yet none of the (3) staff  members would acknowledge or even look at me. I asked for a price on the big white snow leopard (beautiful). The sales girl was yacking loudly on her  cellphone right next to me. She told me she was busy on the phone and asked: ""Do you have problem with that"" in a tough,confrontational manner. It always amazes me how companies can spend a fortune on a great product and showroom then allow rude staff to run the clients off. Oh well........if you want to be insulted, stop in."
Shock awe-  Fabulous collection,January 2019,50,National Geographic Fine Art Galleries,Clarecavan,"My husband and I visited the National Geographic Gallery on a whim.  We were dazzled a the collection.  Brilliant photos of an amazing array of animals, breathtaking wildlife and lovely landscapes.  It was a wonderful surprise to find a gallery of such high quality photographs among boutiques and restaurants in a vacation corner of Florida..  I could not pull myself together to inform the curator of my delight as I gushed like a moron,..  The positions and the lighting were well executed.   This was a highlight of our trip to Lauderdale."
Beautiful Theatre,May 2019,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,svs_1922,"This was my first time experiencing the Adrienne Arsht Center as I bought tickets to see the Lion King Live. The theatre to my surprise was grand and extremely beautiful. The orchestra seating was amazing,I had an awesome view and the seats were comfortable. It was definitely worth spending the extra cash on!"
Beautiful place but can not hear very well,June 2019,30,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,michael c,Concessions amble but very expensive
Great venue,June 2019,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,VETScubaFamily,This place is beautiful and impressive. This is the second time I have attended an event her and couldn’t be happier.  The seats offer great views and the acoustics amazing.
Fantastic venue for music,February 2017,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,C7740XVjuliec,"Beautiful venue to experience a full orchestra. We had tier 2, side,  left seats, last row, and had a fantastic view of the whole stage. The acoustics are excellent. In fact, you can even hear the people on stage speak to the audience without a microphone. Any show in this venue would be worthwhile to see. No obstructions, no echo."
¡FUÁCATA!,March 2017,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,choz02,Went to see our friend play last night.  We were in the carnival theater in the arsht center.  Great little theater.  Great lighting and sound.  All good seats.  Show was great.  This show was general seating.  Don't know if all the plays in that venue are general but if it is then get there early.  They also have a bar with some food which you can bring in.  
Free Tour!,March 2017,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,AnnArborMHT,"Overall great experience; tour is free, informative and a great way to pass an hour in this beautiful complex!"
Miami at its best,March 2017,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Richard M,"This is our first winter in Miami, and we've been thrilled by what a fantastic city it is, and particularly the rich and diverse cultural offerings the city has to offer, especially at the fantastic Arsht Center.  We've attended symphonies, jazz performances, ballet, modern dance, and theatre, and they have been every bit the caliber of what we've found in Manhattan, a very Lincoln Center experience. The venue is superb, the seats are comfortable, and they all have wonderful views, even the seats in the upper tier, which we got for most performances we attended. Tickets aren't cheap, but they're cheaper than Manhattan, and we were NEVER disappointed."
Miami City Ballet Program 4,April 2017,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,danet99,Season Ticket Holders. Will be back!!!  
Great experience!,June 2019,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,mwooduk,"I came here with a Canadian friend for a matinee performance of Come from Away, which is a fantastic play and musical. Thoroughly enjoyed it.  We parked across the street in the lot, for $15.  This was my second time visiting this venue and like my first visit, it was freezing cold so I would recommend that you bring a sweater or cardigan. I had no trouble hearing the sound, which I thought was good, and the seats were comfortable. We had orchestra seats and felt it was good value for money. All the staff are very nice, and we thoroughly enjoyed coming here. Highly recommended for any performances.  "
MISO Opening Night - October 2019,October 2019,10,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Carlos S,"Fully realizing that Miami is not Vienna, Berlin, London or Milan and that Conductor Marturet is par for the course, but he is no Karajan or Bernstein, the 7th was flat and with lots of mistakes. Dudamel would have done a much better job. This performance was like attending an opening night at the National Gallery of Art in DC (which I have done numerous times) and finding Rembrandt and Romero Britto in the same exhibition. Unforgivable. Marturet bringing together this quasi-Cuban upbeat music and the genius of Beethoven is as Frankensteinian an approach as they come. His audience, clearly, was equally ignorant about the mix and spent their evening applauding EACH MOVEMENT. Something that I had neither seen nor heard in 40 years. Even Marturet noticed and simply laughed at it by telling the audience “applaud whenever you feel like it.” It should have been a clear message, but instead it fueled the abysmal ignorance of the audience. Marturet, cognizant of his gargantuan mistake of mixing the two genres, had a minimal presence of mind of recognizing…and I quote “I know that many of you will ask yourselves what is Cuban music doing with Beethoven…what can I say, it’s Miami!” And with that, he confirmed the irrefutable truth about this Gobi Desert of classical culture: Gloria and Emilio Estefan are the highest exponent of music in this town. Sad, but true, my friends. Sad but true."
Ultra veteran says don’t go,March 2019,20,Ultra Music Festival,Lisea1229,"Ohh don’t get me started on the getting out! What a nightmare. I left the festival at 1:30 and got to my home at 5. My suggestion is take an Uber to the shuttle and then get in any bus to get out of Key Biscayne. Just get out and call an Uber there. Also, leave around 12:30ish or earlier so you’re not missing out on everything but you don’t get stuck in that hell hole of traffic"
Exceeded Expectations,March 2019,50,Ultra Music Festival,plysy,"SO this was my first Ultra experience, took the ferry, so no issues with transportation like others have had. I found it simply amazing. Incredible engineering, effects and artist installations....but i am not 20 either...soooo, my take is different than a ""typical"" festival attendee. Research and being prepared made it all the ultimate adventure. Simple fabulous....to me."
Music: A Transportation: F  Staff: D,April 2019,30,Ultra Music Festival,BLDRCO,"New venue seemed great, but getting 60-80k people on and off an island is a challenge, and unfortunately they failed.  End of night one, After being told no less than 5 different things, from no busses, you need to walk, to go down there, nope, go back up there, it took 3 hours to finally get on a bus.  Ultra 5K was born.  People walking home on the bridge.  They admitted the first night was a failure and they pledged to fix it for night 2... well it was a little more organized, people walked again, seeing if they could improve on their 5K time... but we only got back to hotel 10 minutes earlier than night before.  Not wanting to repeat for a third time, we opted to leave early the last night.  Still a challenge to find a bus, I guess because they didn’t expect people to leave at 9...?  Artists/DJ’s were great.  A little sound bleed from the proximity of the stages, but inside it was great.  I literally didn’t want to leave.  I won’t be back while it’s at this venue, I just don’t see how they can logistically get so many people out after it’s over.  Too bad. "
Terrible organisation. ,July 2019,20,Ultra Music Festival,georgea464,"For an event going for at least 6 years, the organisation and assistance is pathetic. Being a ticket holder your behaviour was pathetic. "
Ultra is AWESOME - Except for 1 thing - so take this with you LADIES!,March 2019,40,Ultra Music Festival,mountainmelanie,"Ultra Music Festival is a super fun week to be in Miami – there are tons of events going on all over the place. Miami is not too hot but still great beach weather! The festival itself is over the top with setups, all the stages, sound and the backdrop of Miami is EPIC!!! The one HORRIBLE thing about this festival are the bathrooms… and so here is the solution!! If you are a FEMALE and you are going to Ultra – MAKE SURE that you take disposable pee funnels with you! They fit in a pocket, you just pop them open and stand to pee. You don’t even mind how bad the portapotty is because you don’t get near any contaminated surfaces! I LOVE the SaniGirl ones which are disposable, practical, easy to use and 100% recyclable/eco-friendly (sanigirl.com)  Having these with you will make a huge difference – stay clean/happy/fresh & enjoy the MUSIC! Ultra is TOP!!"

Downtown Tennis in Miami,September 2018,40,Margaret Pace Park,backhand_city,"For tennis lessons check out nearby Backhand City to reserve a class. They have Private and Group Tennis Lessons for adults including: White Falcon, Terminator, Accelerator and LiveBall classes."
Beautiful venue,October 2016,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Mktpro99,"Right off I-95 but parking is $15. Four levels of balconies. They have large screen that is helpful. Excellent sound system. Food is expensive, including water!"
Easy to arrive hard to leave!,October 2016,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,FamilyTraveler62,Wonderful shows and events in a top of the line venue. Safe and secure. Had prepaid parking in Lot C. Not hard to find. Getting out was a somewhat difficult. No one guiding the exit of traffic so it took some time to get out. But right on to the highway from there!
Spooky symphony,October 2016,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,TrinityFlKeys,Incredible talent and a movie screen to follow for kids!!! You cant go to the bathroom and come back in while playing...fyi
Comedy show,November 2016,20,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Murnsey,We were excited to get tickets for the Louis CK comedy show here at the  center last week.... our seats wound up being on the fourth level. What I want to say is the acoustics are so bad if you're on that fourth level especially towards the rear of the auditoriumyou should not waste your money. It is so difficult to hear anything. Perhaps if you watching a ballet and don't have to hear someone talking it wouldn't be so bad. I am so disappointed that a magnificent building like theArsht center has such terrible acoustics.
A bit on the expensive side but a beautiful place,November 2016,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,betabarroca,"Beautiful architecture, great service but the drinks and food sold there are way too expensive! Also for the musical that we watched (Dirty Dancing) the volume was good during the songs but a bit low to understand the speeches from the third tier where we had our seats."
Favorite park in Miami,January 2019,50,Margaret Pace Park,Damica_C,"It’s a great place to read, stretch, jog, people watch, & soak in views."

Mall ,December 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,LollysLook,"The Dolphin Mall in Miami is a big mall. We had to return something at boutique store. We saw it that was located in this mall so we decided to do some shopping here too. It’s a nice big mall with a lot of stores, and eateries."
Best mode of transportation in Miami,November 2019,50,Metromover,carlosaP9438EH,"Miami has one of the worst traffic in the US, specially in the Brickell and downtown area....it.s deadly in the am and pm, specially on  weekends...parking is expensive, but we haveci METROMOVER that can move you from Brickell/coral way area to the PAMM and FROST MUSEUM and the MIAMI HEAT GAMES in a few minutes with a few stops...and its. FREE...PEOPLE RIDE IT AND ENJOY IT...IT.S HEAVEN ON RAILS!"
Best way to see Miami (Downtown) from above.,October 2019,50,Metromover,Martin F,Great way to get around Miami (Downtown). Very clean. Everything automatic no Mertomover drivers. And for free. 
Great transportation.,October 2019,50,Metromover,Jan1961_11,Downtown is this a free transportation. Very safe and you avoid the trafic on the streets.  So great to go with it.
Way Slow,November 2019,20,Metromover,homepukes,"Had to ride this tram to the rental car center in MIA. I had to walk from the H terminal to this thing. I actually went out side thinking I would catch a bus to the rental car center since I happened to catch a wall with “Peoplemover” on it and an arrow. I didn’t know what a Peoplemover was. So I followed the arrow but nothing said exactly where to go. As I was outside noticing there was no Peoplemover I looked up online how to get to the rental car center. Finally, some actual directions, but it said I have to walk a quarter mile just to get on this thing. So I started my hike. Of the 5 or so moving walkways on the way to the Peoplemover at least 2 were not working. The walk area beside the moving walkways can accommodate 2 people walking side by side so you end up getting stuck behind first time travelers walking like they are the only people traveling. Once on the Peoplemover it’s a 1.5 mile ride of shaking and banging around. I had to grab onto a handrail several times just to keep from falling down. Next time I’ll just take Uber."
Beautiful facility,May 2016,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Pineapples-a-Plenty,"Modern, elegant, and impressive. Incredible architecture. A large hall. Parking can be painful. $20 for a morning function. Once inside, this is a ""wow"" experience. "

Great location- parking service is terrible,April 2016,30,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,elizabethg625,"Went to see Cabaret this month and while I love the theater- the parking is just ridiculous.  Besides having to pay the 25.00 valet fee i had to wait more than 30 minutes for my car, which by the way, i could clearly see parked across the street.  i was one of the first few people to turn in my valet ticket.  Why pay this high cost? park elsewhere and save yourself the frustration."
If you have never visited the Adrianne Arsht Center - you should.,April 2016,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Elaano,We have been to the celebration of the Adrianne Arsht Center with Family and Friends and had a amazing time. This Center has a beautiful program for any age. And if you look out also prices that are affordable. This is a great get away.
Evening Out,February 2016,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,dcole2016,Enjoyed a spectacular musical play.  The seats were great. Had a fabulous view of the stage. Looking forward to the next outing. Had a wonderful time.  Would invite more friends to come along.
Free transportation in downtown? Unheard of!,November 2019,50,Metromover,somethingeneric,"I didn’t believe there was free transportation in downtown. It really is! The mover is self driving and there is no driver. Surprisedly, it is well maintained inside and not dirty in the mover. The stations are outdoors and clean and easy to navigate. Occasionally you will see a homeless sitting on the steps of the station entrance. The service was pretty fast ~5 mins and there is a timer in each station. Also lets you know which train’s destination so you don’t take the wrong loop. Miami is great for free transportation infrastructure! "
A must go in Miami Beach,October 2019,50,Espanola Way,489andreask,"Nice outside restaurants of different types. Very old style houses, great athmosphere. Easy to reach from Ocean drive."
Wow-great food choices,August 2019,50,Espanola Way,mantravels2018,Great find-wonderful restuarants-had Cuban one night and Italian with home made pasta the next.  Food is outrageous and reasonable priced.  This was a great find and we really enjoyed the atmosphere and food.  Don't miss it.
Epicurious,November 2019,50,Espanola Way,expat326,"We stumbled on to Espagnola Way while walking around looking for the Art Deco District.  We had passed a couple of buildings that had Art Deco elements but we were still searching.  Then we found Espanola Way and were pleasantly surprised by the pedestrian way, the restaurants, the liveliness of the street.  We settled in for an Italien dinner and had a great time."
Quaint blocks packed with restaurants ,November 2019,30,Espanola Way,beckslib,We walked the couple of blocks or so of this area & it was nice but we didn’t stop to eat. Had we been hungry there would have several places we would have wanted to try. It seems like the kind of destination that gets more lively as the day wears on. Note that the surrounding area is not as quaint if you’re walking & you may encounter some interesting people & shops.
Noisy and crowded,November 2019,30,Espanola Way,copejenney,With so many eateries in SoBe I would choose somewhere else to go. Lots to pick from and nice that it is pedestrian only but you will get many restaurant hawkers hawking to you to come in to their establishment.

BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO VISIT ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT,August 2019,50,Miami Design District,Worldalert,"The Design District is full of restaurants and high end shops.   You have to try ""Estefan's Kitchen"".  Excellent cuban food.  It is owned by Gloria and Emilio Estefan, famous Cuban signer.   They have music and people get up to dance.  Best Mojito!!!  You can walk all around the Miami Design District.  There is ample parking on the sides, you have to pay for it of course, or you can valet.   The place is always full with people walking.  Very safe place to walk at night as well.  Highly recommend this place if you are visiting Miami.  "

Knight Concert Hall is a first-rate venue for live classical music,January 2016,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,GregLee7,"This review is only for the Knight Concert Hall, which is just a part of the Adrienne Arsht Performing Arts Center in downtown Miami.  This is a beautiful new concert hall with excellent acoustics.  Went to hear the Cleveland Orchestra perform live.  I've been to numerous concert halls in New York, Washington, Chicago, and Cleveland.  The Knight Concert Hall is on par with the best of them.  Also, good wine and sandwiches for sale at reasonable prices.  If you love classical music, you can't go wrong here."
Behind the scenes - a tour of the facilities,February 2016,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,HaroldRodgers,"On Monday's at noon a free guided tour is available of the facilities.  The tour lasted approximately an hour.  It took us through the three facilities where performances take place.  You come away with a background of the facility, an appreciation of the design and the desire to take in a performance in each of the venues.  "
Beautiful place,February 2016,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Luci C,Can here for a contert and had great seat. Holds a lot of people but it looked like everyone had a pretty good view. Seats comfortable. Reasonable size bathrooms so you don't wait all night.
"Miami has a Scala, too!",January 2016,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,FelipeS60,"My wife and I went to see Norma at the Adrienne Arsht Center and it was awesome! Miami has its own Scala and it is beautiful. Everything there breaths beauty and elegance. Everybody who works there was extremely polite and kind. The performance was flawless and the players who performed were second to no one. What a talent! It was a night to remember and I highly recommend this place to all who wants to soothe their souls with beauty, class, and talent. "
An exciting building,February 2016,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,278mackay,"I must say that after the Q and A, the only washrooms available for a large crowd of women was off from the cafe. Really? Two stalls only? They had said the main restrooms were being cleaned. We were not impressed."
Beautiful little place ,September 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,riboo92,It's free to enter but you can donate to help keep the gardens going.
Skip Ocean Drive and Relax,September 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Edward S M,"Are you lost and fed up with all of the D grade tourists wandering ocean drive? his is one of the jewels of Miami Beach. No crack dealears over in this area, enjoy."
Over rated,November 2019,10,Little Havana,camillah213,We went on our own. The place is over rated and not worth the time to go. We had a mojito and it was not good at all but expensive.
Nice area but full of tourists,December 2018,30,Little Havana,jedferrari,"Nice area that indeed looks like Havana will lots of small shops, restaurants, and people in the street. Nice atmosphere but sometimes too many tourists!"
Excellent,November 2019,50,Little Havana,KayeS111,"I really enjoyed my day spent wandering around the shops, getting the odd coffee and alcoholic beverage, smoking cigars and enjoying the atmosphere. "
Incredible tour through Miami Culinary Tours,October 2019,50,Little Havana,voyagerguru,"We had the chance to go on a food tour in Little Havana and we absolutely fell in love with this little neighborhood. It was such a blast to explore the eateries and bars. While you can totally explore on your own, we recommend going with Miami Culinary Tours. There are some hidden gems here that you may miss on your own."
Loved our stroll in Little Havana,December 2018,50,Little Havana,saxboy85,My wife and I enjoyed some great Cuban coffee and conversation.  We also got a tip for a great Cuban restaurant in the area!
Fun way to travel ,October 2019,40,Miami Trolley,Sayeedac1,"A quaint old-fashioned free means of travel around downtown Miami & other places. Wooden seats with air conditioned trolleys, it's an interesting to go around town. Somewhat slow but nevertheless a great experience. I found every one of the drivers friendly and accommodative. "
Good option for getting around downtown,October 2019,40,Miami Trolley,GGGang,"I wish I’d have researched this transportation option more before we visited Miami. You can download an app, which provides trolley locations and next stops. Sadly we had no mobile data and WiFi around the area was hit and miss. That said the trolleys were a great option to get around without the need for a car, bonus being they’re completely free,"
Lovely transport ,September 2019,40,Miami Trolley,marianngabriella,"The trolley is a free way of public transport in Miami. It has lot of lines, we can easily reach our destination. "
Free trolley to get around downtown,October 2019,50,Miami Trolley,Miata-lover,"We were able to pick up a trolley at cruise ship terminal G and take it to downtown Miami.  It was free and very convenient for a day in port.  Once we figured out the various routes, we were able to use it (and the metro mover) to see all of downtown.  You can download the app to to see where all of the trolleys are at any point in time.  Great system."
The Great Sandoval!!,January 2015,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,danielem430,"The fantastic Arturo Sandoval's concert (with his friends Albita and Willie Chirino) shows the Cuban side of Miami, in an amazing location!!"
The Arsht Center for the performing Arts,October 2015,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Marlene H,"I have been to the Center many times and has always been a fabulous experience.  It is a beautiful venue that brings many well known artists and Broadway shows, it also has restaurants and hotels near the venue. Highly recommended to all!"
"Beautiful venue, unprofessional staff.",October 2015,30,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,James R, You have a world class venue that needs to be run as so. My tickets to see The Barber of Seville are going up for sale on StubHub and I will fly in the New York and go to the Beacon Theater to see my music rather than flying to Miami to hear the ushers.
Our jewel in Miami,November 2015,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Marilyn F,"Our performing arts center is amazing.  It has two different big theaters for opera, ballet, musicals and an intimate black box theater that is just perfect.  The acoustics here are exceptional and the programming is varied and accessible.  I only have one gripe with the Arsht, and that is their bars.  They have the worse barstenders and their drinks are so but so miniscule that they are smaller than the little bottles you get in the planes and at prices that are simply ridiculous.  I was there Saturday and I have always complained about the pours and the bartenders, but after this one time, they lost me.  I will not order any more drinks there -- not worth the aggravation, and I must say we go to the Arsht for concerts, musicals and love their black box.  They need to improve their drinks!!!!"
We saw the barber of Seville ,November 2015,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Guillermo R,"Great place for Opera, had a blast. The place is very well maintained and clean. People are respectful and organizers are great people and very helpful. "
If you have time to spare this is...,October 2019,40,Miami Trolley,mailroom2017,If you have time to spare this is a great adventure to get a picture or even where you might like to spend more time. Cheap and the kids loved it....
Great art work!,October 2018,50,Britto Central,ychocolate2015,"My husband and I love Britto's work, and we really enjoyed visiting the studio.  We almost bought a print, but we decided to wait. We are collectors of his work so the store offered us a great deal that included a frame, shipping, and a coffee table book.  "
Britto Store,October 2018,30,Britto Central,tina_travels8,"Im not a Britto fan, but my friend really likes his art, so in we went. The store itself is really nicely layed out, the art very colourful and surprisingly, there were things I loved and could afford.  Nice surprise stop on Lincoln Rd. "
Beautiful art and great staff,November 2018,50,Britto Central,FredSiegel,You need to have a Britto for your collection.  The stuff has amazing color and is just cool.  Staff is very nice and very helpful.
Colourful and eclectic ,December 2018,50,Britto Central,DougG305," Return trip and spent an hour there looking and enjoyed. Bought a limited edition and having sent as a gift, so nothing for us this time but will be back as everyone should have a Britto in there house. The service was excellent and knowledgeable and helped us through the purchase. Great stop and always fun"
Great art and artist bit be careful ,February 2019,40,Britto Central,danfriedmanmd,"Brazilian artist Britto began his lucrative and illustrious career right here in Miami Beach and this is his flagship studio. But I could tell (in my opinion) that some of the artwork was inked or colored by others as it didn’t match some of the older work in the store. The colors, however, were bright and playful, reflecting his heritage. "
Birthday celebration,July 2018,40,Bal Harbour Beach,wandadenise80,There was algae along the shore. It would have been nice if the city would have removed the algae to allow the beach to be more enjoyable. Although we couldn’t go into the water the sun was out which made for a beautiful day.
Super nice beach ,July 2018,50,Bal Harbour Beach,marcialg809,"This Bal Harbour Beach is not that crowded, because it is located within the hotels and private condos."
Clean and calm,July 2018,40,Bal Harbour Beach,P K,There were a few people on the beach. Beach service only for hotels by the beach. Water was warm. There is a walking path next to the beach
Don't miss the Beach Art Path,August 2018,50,Bal Harbour Beach,annettefromm,"Apparently, the city of  Bal Harbour is now hosting art exhibits on the path which skirts be beach from 99th to 102nd Streets.  This makes a lovely walk in the morning or late afternoon, when the sun is not as strong. The exhibit we saw, up til October 20, 2018, is of individuals in Albania with very informative labels.  I think my husband and I were the only walkers looking at the exhibit - that's actually why we trekked out to Bal Harbour.  The walk and the exhibit are really worthwhile."
Worth a visit once (for locals),August 2019,30,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Mdefil23,I've lived in MB for 8 years and have been a couple of times. I went recently. I'm not crazy about art but there are some cool things in it. Maybe a decent spot to take a date.
"Flamenco Show - March 13, 2015",March 2015,20,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,DRudasill,"Bought tickets for the show to go with our elderly parents.  Although the show was amazing!  The Knight Concert Hall was not nor were the ushers.  I have attended numerous performances at the Knight Concert Hall and the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.  When we arrived we went to find our seats the usher directed us to a totally different set of seats on the odd number side - we then had to interrupt other guest and finally made our way to our seats.  The air conditioned did not even feel as it was on it was so warm and uncomfortable through out the entire showing we tried to tell someone no one seemed to care.  Then before the show was over there was a fire alarm.  We could not hear what was going on it took more than 5 minutes to turn on the lights (thankfully it was just an alarm and not an actual fire) it would have been complete disaster!  We never go to finish the show (again no one cared the only words out of the ushers mouths were sorry it was almost over anyway!  What??) That last performance is like the grand finale its the one you came to see.  We then made our way after a long walk down the stairs to the valet which was even more of a disaster.  They were not allowing people to sit inside.  There is not many places to sit outside so my poor mother had to stand which is very hard for her and the employees just don't care - rude, rude and more rude.  You pay to go out for a nice evening and end up asking yourself why did you bother - paying your money for an event where no one seems to care if you enjoyed yourself nor were they accommodating to your needs - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY GOING TO AN EVENT HERE!!"
Wicked play ,March 2015,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Wendybob0205,"Went here today to see Wicked. We sat towards the back of the orchestra section and had aisle seats. However, they did not have a walkway on the other end so there was only the one way in to get to the seats so we had to get up a lot to let people in and out. A bottle of water was $4.00 but they also had water fountains to quench your thirst. We pre paid for parking in lot C and so thankful we did easy in and out. The seats are old and not as comfortable as you would expect for sitting for a play that's 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Well staffed and helpful employees. "
Wicked!,March 2015,40,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Luv2travel101974,"First time visiting this beautiful center for the performing arts and thought it was fantastic. My only disappointment was in the lack of places to eat on site, or near by for that matter. Arrived with ample time (2+ hours) and still was not able to eat at any of the restaurants in here. Play was wonderful and seating was comfortable! Valet parking service I must say is the best I have ever seen! Can't wait to come back!"
Wicked,March 2015,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,Sue B,"Awesome theatre venue, great staff, loved valet parking option UNTIL it was time to leave and retrive vehicle. It was not the staff's fault but patrons were obnoxious. Had never encountered such rude people at theatre any where else on east coast."
An amazing Opera House in Miami!,November 2014,50,Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County,LuizDutraNeto,"I discovered the ""Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts"" when leaving another Miami's icon: the ""Pérez Art Museum""! Bingo! The signs were outlining the American première of the acclaimed ""Ballet Nacional de España"", bringing to Florida its newest masterpiece - ""Sorolla"". It was November 2014. I just made a quick stop at the ticket office and got the chance to attend a magnificent performance. ""Sorolla"" stages dance traditions, pulsating music and fantastic costumes that bring to life the many colorful regions of Spain. Attending it in Miami - the capital city of Hispano-America - added a special meaning to the occasion!  The ""Ziff Ballet Opera House"" stands among the best ones in the world. Modern, efficient and very beautiful. No problems or complaints about parking, ushers, catering or sound! We had a perfect and remarkable evening. While visiting Miami, please do check ""Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts"" agenda and indulge yourself to unforgettable spectacles. Enjoy!"
"Small, but interesting",June 2019,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,huggio,"At the very least, stop in and see The Wrestler. He's in the lobby so you can see him without paying the entry fee."
Very unique and eclectic museum dedicated to Art Deco.,September 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,normg554,"If you are a fan of the Art Deco style so prevalent in South Beach this is the best museum maybe in the world to see examples. Everything from home appliances to furniture to paintings to scupture to rental;es, it is all here on three floors of what used to be a moving and storage warehouse. Allow at least 2 hours. And do not miss the gift shop. Unique ArtDeco and Florida gifts, books and decorations."
A Great Art Deco Museum in the heart of Miami Beach,October 2019,40,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,AnnieTravels7,I wasn't sure what to expect but the museum was great. Lots of great art deco pieces! I also loved the gift shop - it's small but has some nice unique gifts and souvenirs.
Great exhibit,October 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,markfL8858DL,"Great collection and narrative for Art Deco design.  Definitely worth a stop!  The gift shop is full of books and gift items, including great selection for children."

Biscayne  bay boat tours,July 2018,40,Fisher Island,Candy L,Great boat tour around  islands with millionaire mansions of famous people.

ZWF’S WILDLIFE PRESENTATION PACKAGE WAS AMAZING!,October 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Lourdes M,"the ZWF’S WILDLIFE PRESENTATION package. Honestly, it was AMAZING and more then I expected! I was lucky to have a small group and an amazing tour guide! Roger, our tour guide, was fantastic and knew a lot of information about the animals and place! This was worth every penny, and I recommend it to everyone! Gaby, the young women who helped set us up was absolutely fantastic as well! My favorite part was the presentation as we got to see and interact with many amazing animals but my favorite was the lion cub! Overall, it was amazing and i will defiantly be heading back to ZWF!"
Hat Trick For ZWF,October 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Lori R,"If you are contemplating a visit here, do yourself a favour and go. It is an experience of a lifetime. We still talk of our previous two visits here years ago. The memories you make here will last forever."

Limbani is just amazing!!! I highly suggest if you are looking for the greatest experience of your life you should go visit this place!!!! Just truly astonishing!!! A+++++++++"
This place should be #1 thing to do if you are in Miami... hands down,October 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Amber J,"I will never be able to express how amazing today was but will try... my man mate and I flew down here to meet limbani and have a sloth encounter and it blew away my expectations and was worth every cent! The staff there was so friendly and knowledgeable and did NOT make you feel like a number or rushed. They let you take pictures and video and truly made this day the best day of my life!! The sloths wouldn’t come out but we still got to feed them and the zoo keeper answers all our questions and knew so much about them! What an experience!! If you love chimpanzees as I do you will fall in love with Limbani as soon as you look into his eyes and he interacts with you! His handler was amazing and you can see the bond they have and he again made me feel comfortable and was so friendly!! The interaction I was able to have with Limbani was one in a million and I truly can’t thank the staff enough!! Make sure you buy the picture packet and don’t forget to tip them they are amazing and I am so glad there is a place like this, if I lived in Florida I would be here all the time and try all of the encounters! Spend the money go do this it is truly a wonderful off the charts experience!! Yes I am  a person real feel free to email me if you had any questions !! **note this is NOT the professional photos one taken with my phone**"

Best time for Arts and parties in Miami,January 2019,50,Art Basel,Michael L,ONLY IN MIAMI
Very suitable suitable,August 2018,40,Art Basel,stevyzdunek,"In this place I have attended several conferences and events, I like it when they do it here, since it is prepared for all kinds of events, it is comfortable and offers good services."
Artsy,May 2019,50,Art Basel,miamirider1979,"As an art lover in Miami this is a must place to go, to have an insight of what its like to be an artist. "
No Longer the Exciting Venue?!?,December 2018,30,Art Basel,eventsbythirteen,"Art Basel- Miami was a force to be reckoned with!!! Now this venue , once the place for innovative, provacative art, socializing in this realm, has turned to a mad rush to see whatever you can, you meet no one, as that who is now in attendance, the parties, yawn! Where did it go wrong?!"
"Not anywhere as good as it was,",December 2018,40,Art Basel,watersignwoman,"Yes it is still worth the trip to Miami. Yes the number of paintings is overwhelming. Yes it is certainly a “happening” but having gone the last 9 years last year and the year before were very disappointing. Why? When we used to go almost all the paintings and illustrations were “manned” by the artists. We (myself and the teens I took) were able to meet the artists, discuss the paintings and ask questions. The last two years there were almost no artists: all the spaces were fronted by gallery owners. They did not welcome any question but: how much. They did not want to bother with enthusiastic and very polite teenagers. That was issue one. Issue two: I was always thrilled to see the Picasso’s, Lichtenstein’s, Modigliani’s among the newer art pieces. A few years ago I was stunned by the beauty of a Magritte dove. The kids were thrilled to recognize Chuck Close paintings and Duane Hanson sculptures. None this year. And the biggest disappointment: the general downgrading of quality. I asked my son, who is an artist, aliguoriart.com, what happened? He said that Art Basel is only about selling now and the cost for younger artists at the Convention Center is prohibitive. SO if you want to see great art at reasonable admission fee: go to the neighborhood shows and galleries near the Convention Center. That’s where the really good art is to be found; best show and gallery: Spectrum Gallery in Miami. It’s really too bad about Art Basel used to be fabulous."
Amazing exhibits. Reason I came to Miami,May 2019,50,HistoryMiami,freddiefreddie,"What a great museum. They not only have some of the most friendly and helpful staff like Valentina and Sabrina, but they have well organized exhibits! We came for Queer Miami, but were pleasantly surprised at the level of design and thought that went into the permanent exhibits. "
EXTREMELY HELPFUL!,February 2018,50,Visit Miami Beach Visitors Center,sunnybtravels,Needless to say I loaded up with helpful brochures of everything that interested me and left feeling excited and inspired to check out my new city.

This museum offers a quick view of  the history of Miami.,February 2018,30,HistoryMiami,Merker Moreira M,"It was a nice visit, but it does not deserve a second one. I expected more info about Miami during the beginnings of this city,"
Social history comes to life,September 2018,50,HistoryMiami,619jeffry,"Miami has a rich history, but people make history, not relics. If found the emphasis on social history to be quite fascinating. Miami was a boom city of the 20th century, it has grown from a swamp to be a metropolis of  5 million people in 100 years. Miami is said to be the capital of Latin America, it has people from all over South America and the Caribbean. We spent a whole day at the museum. We are not Americans, but it was time well spent."
Helpful and informatative,February 2014,50,LGBT Visitor Center Miami Beach,boomerjohn,"I found the LGBT visitor center to be a good source of information on the area. Plenty of maps, and brochures. The fellow working the desk was friendly and helpful as he gave pointers to area attractions. I loved the gentle irony of the fact the our welcome center was the first office you see as you enter the justice center tower. How far we have come."
Chill Experience,May 2018,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,KristinR505,"This was one of my favorite parts of my trip. If you want to get away from the South Beach experience, a short drive will take you to an area full of art and this brewery. Sitting down and having a flight at Concrete was the best way to unwind after a crazy day on the beach. It was so relaxing and the beer was not bad either. The patio is a nice place to enjoy the breeze and sip local brew. I will return when I am in the city again. "

Great play The Tin Woman,May 2016,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,FoodLover7000,"We were a party of 6 and saw the tin woman play. Let me start off by saying that this was our first time coming here. A member of our party randomly bought tickets to this play not knowing anything. Most of us did not want to go but we decided to ""bite the bullet"". Not knowing if there was a dress code, we called and asked and were told that business casual is fine. When we arrived we were noticing a lot of older people. (That did not bother us) we were seated in the upstairs theater which was a bit small but this allowed us to feel closer to the actors. We were in the second row so we really saw every move the actors made. The play was good and the actors were very good. At first, the play seemed boring but I started to get more interested in the story. Overall, it was our first time and we had fun . It was something different for us to do. "
One spectacular experience!,April 2018,50,HistoryMiami,Pineapples-a-Plenty,"You can easily spend a few hours here, and they will be well spent. This is possibly the best kept secret in town!"
Worth a visit,May 2018,40,HistoryMiami,GeorgeJames2000,Interesting museum with two building locations focusing on both the history and culture of South Florida. Reasonable admissions fee and a variety of engaging content areas.
Great to Avoid Traffic,September 2018,50,Miami Metrorail,HarvestDream,"We took the Metrorail from Dadeland to the Airport.  It took about an hour from parking to get into the airport.  The ride is smooth and quick, fare is not bad at all.  Delays on the line caused us to have to switch lines, and have a slight delay, but they got us there!  Other passengers told us sometimes reliability could be a problem but that is not the norm."
GREAT BALLET,July 2013,50,Miami City Ballet,Hank C,"We had the chance to enjoy one of their performance, it was awesome from the beginning to the end, great choreography and dancers. "
Great beers ,December 2018,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,Beanie14,We visited here after Wynwood Walls. They have a good range of their own beers. We tried a few different types and enjoyed them all.

my neighborhood theater,July 2014,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,henri m,great director theater is a landmark in the city of Coral Gables which is known as The City Beautiful. the architecture is art deco and the viewing is supperb with great acoustics
"Spot for locals, not much for tourist",January 2019,20,Domino Park,faijason,"Me and my family went to this spot following the recommendations on many tourist guide, website etc. The street where this park is located is quite interesting such as the cigar shop, the ice-cream shops... but the park itself is not. All we've seen were just a bunch of seniors playing domino, we don't even feel interesting to get in...."
NICE but,July 2017,40,HistoryMiami,LITOTRAVEL,"nice building and area, the only thing I dont like and feel secure was that homelless was seating all arround full of bag and I didnt feel confortable at all"
good option to meet and view the city,April 2018,50,Miami Metrorail,cindy a,"the metro rail is fine and safe the outer train which links you is like riding in a new York city train, unpredictable and keep your eyes open. they have law or security guarding from skipping fare but they have no education and are a holes when asked questions. facts."
Surprisingly good,December 2011,40,Miami City Ballet,Andreja V,Long time ago I went to a Miami Ballet and it was very amateur and kind of funny/sad. Now days they are serious group and I warmly recommend their program.
fantastic ballet,December 2011,50,Miami City Ballet,bgerber948,"Miami city ballet ranks just behind New York, which makes it world class and you can see it here."
WONDERFUL!,January 2012,50,Miami City Ballet,Betty K,"The Miami City Ballet is arguably one of the very best ballet companies in the United States.  In addition to their main performances at the Arscht Center for the Performing Arts, they also present informal programs at the school in Miami Beach.  Don't miss seeing the wonderful company!"
A Lot of Fun - Great Craft Beer!,July 2018,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,Mike T,I have been to Concrete Beach several times. I think this is the best craft beer brewery win Wynwood. The beers and selection are great! The prices are reasonable. The place is fun! Do a flight or two. You won't be disappointed.
Great evening with our dog ,August 2018,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,Sunniedays4u,Such a fun brewery! Awesome beer!!! Yet the Havana lager for an smooth easy drinking beer...ordered tacos from a place close by. The bartenders are amazing! Brought over our golden retriever water right away & were so nice. They don’t have food but your welcome to bring in food. Don’t miss out on this brewery. 
Great beers and a fun atmosphere,August 2018,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,Scott W,Really enjoyed this place.   In the heart of Wynwood and one of three breweries on the same street.   Stopped by to try it out the other day.   We were early so had the place to ourselves.   Large indoor and outdoor social area and a great variety of local quality craft beers.   The beertender was great and helped us choose our flights and the Bouvalay was a real treat.   The store prices for their Stiltsville and Havana lager are higher than Total Wine or Target but they have some other finds you cannot get retail elsewhere.   The rose and the bouvalay are unique and superb.
Great to see the players and the domino's,April 2018,50,Domino Park,Peter R,As mentioned previously in the tour of Little Havana ti is great to see the old folks playing domino's and chess. it is also good to walk around the street and look at the shops. 
"Learn lots, see lots, enjoy lots",January 2017,40,HistoryMiami,annettefromm,"This is a history museum going through great transitions.  They have permanent exhibits which touch on many topics from the very hidden prehistory of the area to today's cultural diversity.  There are also changing and temporary exhibits.  The colorful folklife exhibits are well, colorful but lacking in people.  The changing history exhibit helps to expose many of the large collections in storage. If you've got kids, look for the free family days.  If you want to see some life added into the folklife area, look for artist in resident programs"
"Metrorail I use it everyday, Douglas Station, Government Center in the Morning and Coconut Grove Station in the evening.",February 2018,10,Miami Metrorail,Christine G,"I’ve seen people sleeping in the floor, there’s food left, paper bags, anytime of the day... it’s dirty!! The stations have elevators and escalators that constantly are broken. You need to keep security at the stations and in the trains. You bring new trains and it will be the same story... what a shame. How do you aspect people to give up cars and use public transportation in Dade County? "
Dirty,February 2018,10,Miami Metrorail,Fersalou,Disgustingly dirty! AC was not working or cooling. Stale & bad smelling. A very unpleasant experience. 
Love Midtown,September 2013,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,Teddy85re,Great to dinner during the week and perfect for shopping during the weekend.
Found it by accident,September 2013,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,Wlc345,"I jumped on a trolley near my hotel and rose until I came to midtown. A very cool vibe with a mix of furniture stores, art and restaurants. It was quiet and more calm than SoBe or Bayside. I highly recommend it. "
A beautiful church!,August 2015,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Alfred R,"A local and historical church, that has been well maintained! It is in downtown Miami, and has public parking in back and across the street. The inside of the church is very inviting. "
Beautiful church but ultra-conservative,October 2015,20,Gesu Catholic Church,JohnK329,"I am a practicing Catholic and had been all my life.  I normally gravitate towards the Jesuit churches due to their out of the box thinking and intelligent discourse.  After a few Sundays at Gesu, I left and will not be coming back.  This happened after the priest giving the sermon talked about how Yoga was the work of the devil.  This was the last of several sermons I had heard there and could not take it anymore.  "
Brewery with games!,May 2018,30,Concrete Beach Brewery,bagwags,Would return again
Very nice place!,April 2018,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,joshuakreid27,"The vibe, decor, location and building are amazing! Beers were very solid not A+ yet but this is only a 3 year old brewery with major upside!!! Would love to come back again!!!"
Beer lovers delight ,April 2018,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,janel357,Bit tricky to find but worth a visit. The paddles were great: 13 different varieties. Wish they’d had some finger food though as we were starving 
very nice experience at the actors playhouse,January 2013,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,gpmia,We love the fact that the plays setting is not so big and wherever you sit you can comfortably enjoy the show.  they have good actors and have good plays most of the time.
Community theatre Gem in Coral Gables,February 2013,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,ear4jc,"Went to see my sons' talented girlfriend play the Fairy God Mother in a production of Cinderella (so  yes,  I will be a biased reviewer).  Great community theatre with talented staff."
Best place we visited in miami,August 2016,50,HistoryMiami,earth_gypsy,"We really enjoyed the different exhibitions, something for everyone and we were lucky enough to be there on an event day so entry was free. Knowledgeable and super friendly guides. "
Trains are always delayed.  Escalators always broken,August 2017,10,Miami Metrorail,SUSANA E,"They should call it Metro-Fail.  The Trains are always delayed.  During rush hour they are supposed to run every 5 minutes.  Well now they are running 12 mins which causes the trains to be excessively overcrowded.  Not to mention the AC sometimes does not work at all during this very hot summer.  Escalators or elevators always broken for weeks on end.  One thing they got right was the 34 Express Bus Routes.  Now they have a 34A & B which really helps you not drive and take the express.  Works very nicely, new hybrid buses.  "
one trick pony,November 2016,30,Miami Metrorail,frez,"The Metrorail inits own it's ok...only if it served a purpose. Let's be honest, if Miami had a public transportation system it would be the worst in any main city in the world!!....the bus service is unreliable, which you would have to take in order to reach one of the Metrorail stations. It is convenient only if you live within a block of a station and work within a block of another. Walking in Miami's heat and humidity is a torture.Miami has bar none the worst public transportation system of any major city I had visited."
Free !,September 2017,50,Miami Metrorail,Patrick C,Perfect to discover Downtown and Brickell. This metro rail is free ! Perfect to see all the Miami skyline and take great pictures .
"Safe, clean and free",June 2017,50,Miami Metrorail,laradiva,You can't beat this ride! It is an excellent way to see the city and the best part it is for free. You feel like you are in a Disney ride. (smiling)
Great way to get around,November 2017,50,Miami Metrorail,lazytravel,Great way to ride for free while in Downtown or Brickell. The cars are clean and are quite frequent. 
Beautiful Catholic Church!,April 2015,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Pvazz824,"Gesu Catholic Church is a very old church located in downtown Miami. The church inside is beautiful, with very old frescos on the wall and woodwork, you will definitely appreciate the old architecture.  It's a hidden gem in the middle of the old downtown Miami area."
Stop on in,July 2015,40,Gesu Catholic Church,travelbug2332,Very old church downtown that used to have a school attached. Defintely worth a visit if you are walking through downtown.
Fun brewery,January 2018,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,Karen937OH,This brewery has a fun vibe & good beer. Order the sampler so you can try 5 or 6. It’s located in the heart of Wynwood so easy to walk around so take it all in !
Great beer and patio,February 2018,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,synder,"Best brewery in Wynwood due to great beers and nice indoor/outdoor space. Some bartenders were more attentive than others, but overall a good brewery."
Our favorite of several in the area,February 2018,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,darwinmoore,"Neat place with a good indoor & patio area.  Nice beer selection, helpful bartenders, and even self-serve taps for filtered water.  Hip place in old industrial area."
Beer quality inversely proportional to the service,February 2018,10,Concrete Beach Brewery,gloriam898,"We went in the afternoon and tried four beers, after picking up all Wynwood we decided that this was the place to spend the night drinking beer, well, the worst decision, we were never served, despite my partner's wheelchair, when asked and the answer was really unpleasant, I suspect that they saw us very ""Latino"" even though our dollars were very American."
"Fun, comfortable microbrewery",March 2018,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,768derekm,"We wandered over to Concrete Beach Brewing after taking in some music and eats at the Wynwood Yard. There's some construction going on in front of it that made it a little harder to find, but once we were there, it was really cool inside. They had security out front doing ID checks, which I've never experienced at a microbrewery before; that kind of security felt more like a club. There's a bar and seating indoors and out. I ordered a ""Mas Hops"" IPA that was very good. Glad we stopped by. "
More Interesting than Expected,February 2016,40,HistoryMiami,IL-Snowbirds,The main exhibits are fun and interesting. Here is a picture of an Art Deco curling iron and a painted wall.
It could be better,April 2016,30,HistoryMiami,BarbaraT20162016,I though it had more things but it's quite small for a city like Miami. Plus the vice director didn't help me when i wrote her about my researches.
Traveling to the airport,May 2017,50,Miami Metrorail,nicafeliz,"We were taking a friend to the airport, and decided it would be faster to take the Metro. It was a great decission! We took it at Dadeland Mall and goes to the airport, without changing from metro if you take the orange line."
Great orange line service to MIA,May 2017,50,Miami Metrorail,WheelingTraveler,You can use this service to reach MIA including the rental car center. Miami traffic really does not favor driving during rush hours between 4 and 7PM.
Horrible ,August 2016,10,Miami Metrorail,320hildah,"The Miami  Metrorail is public transportation. It runs from Palmetto station to Dadeland South and vice Versa.  It's a convenient way of transportation, if the passenger destination is close to the train station. It save you in gas and the stress of driving, however, the trains are old, dirty, unkept, constantly breaking down and running late. They charge $123.00 monthly for a monthly pass including parking. Once in a while they have the Express which run from Civic Center Station north to Palmetto Station and vice Versa.  Again, the condition of these trains need much improvement, pronto. "
Dirty people hanging out & sleeping in seats,November 2016,20,Miami Metrorail,Thomas K,"Feel Uncomfortable. STREET people hanging out. Dirty Cars, Not enough security enforcement. Service was SLOW and INTERMITTENT, CANNOT UNDERSTAND CONDUCTORS ON SPEAKERS."
Handy Transport in Miami,October 2016,40,Miami Metrorail,Iain H,"The Metrorail itself is very handy. It is clean, cheap and efficient, but the people who ride on it make for an ominous experience each time. There should be a better police presence. NO stations feel safe and once on the train you are effectively in an unmanned bubble with whoever else is travelling."
Miami's oldest Catholic church,May 2014,50,Gesu Catholic Church,RMPTravel,"One of my favorite in Miami, used to attend frequently when worked downtown. Always find serenity and peace within. It's one of the most beautiful in Miami as its a true place of worship and providing service to its flock. Many new churches have not accomplished this. The mural is beautiful, and depicts the diversity of the faithful.  It needs upkeep (requires money) but never fails to provide what one is seeking; spirituality."
A place which inspires you!,August 2014,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Jean P,"This is the oldest catholic church in Miami. The inside takes you back to another time and place. Beautiful marble statues, paintings all to help you focus on the eternal."
Oldest  chuch  in  Miami,January 2015,50,Gesu Catholic Church,peppopat,"The  church  is  historic  and built  before  Miami  became  a  city.  Elegant  inside  and  holds  Seats  about 300  people.  Great  pictures  of  the  Station  of the  Cross.  You  can  bring  your  own  candles  and  place  the  in  the stand  and  pray.  If  you  to  pray  for  someone,  you  can  put  their  name  in  a book."
Great spot & beer!,August 2017,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,Jenelle634,"Really enjoyed this brewery, the space was great and the staff super friendly.  They were hosting a fundraising and adoption event for a local animal shelter when we visited, made the experience that much sweeter!"
Fun for a drink,August 2017,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,DagmarYlva,"If you're looking for an industrial area to have a nice beer, this is a good place. We were late for the tour, so I would like to try that next time. "
Too industrial. Needs food/restaurant ,October 2017,30,Concrete Beach Brewery,JorgeLD,"I had big expectations. The beer was good but felt too much instrumental, I was really looking for more artisan beer. Having said that, good number of options. The place desperately needs a restaurant or gastro pub as they currently just serve popcorn... the wynwood area is amazing. "
Horrible service,October 2017,10,Concrete Beach Brewery,B6773MLcristinac,"I was standing at the bar for like 15mins ( on a weekday, when the bar isn't packed or anything ) and didn't get served. Not coming back. "
Nice pint,October 2017,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,Ian S,"Nice atmoshere , recommended"
Great way to spend an afternoon and learn something about south Florida along the way,November 2015,40,HistoryMiami,mrancer,"We spent a couple days in Miami getting ready to leave on a tour of Cuba and decided that we wanted to learn more about the history of the area.  This museum filled the bill.  They had a special multi-media exhibit on the airlift of children whose parents were sending them out of Cuba to the US in the early 60s and it provided really interesting background for our trip to Cuba a few days later.  We had a long and very informative discussion with a museum curator who answered some of our questions and offered additional insights.  Then, in a separate building, there is a very good exhibit on the history of settlement in the Miami region, from Indians through Spanish colonial times and into the 20th century as Americans flocked south for the sun and Latin Americans came north for political and economic opportunities."
Metromover - Another way of view of downtown Miami,March 2017,40,Miami Metrorail,Freddie707,"We hopped on the free Metromover to get an overview of a portion of the downtown area. It was enjoyable...the price was right (free!!), and we got off within walking distance of our hotel."
Great way to get about,March 2017,50,Miami Metrorail,KentFred,Walking distance from our hotel and a great and totally free way to get about downtown Miami and to get to Bayside where we always enjoy a prec ruise lunch.
Amazing trip to S. Miami,March 2017,50,Miami Metrorail,Michelle W,I did have a great connection.. walked up to to a waiting train and it  left within 3 minutes at the airport. This was 7PM on a Friday... about 25 minutes to S. Dadeland. Totally amazing. 
Beat the traffic!,March 2017,30,Miami Metrorail,Oconnos,During rush hour this is the ONLY way to avoid the inevitable traffic jam. Jump on the rail from the airport and sail south or north as close as you can get to your destination--you might even catch an express if you  are lucky. At the end of the line or as close to your destination as you can and then take a local bus or just uber it from there!
Easy to get around,March 2017,40,Miami Metrorail,flyingjenny,We used the Metrorail a couple of times during our trip to Miami. It was clean and air-conditioned. I give a 4 because we tried to do a one-way to the airport but that wasn't an option on the ticket machine--just reloading or buying a card.
Surprisingly Good,November 2015,50,HistoryMiami,Vincent M,"Logistics: HistoryMiami is on Flagler between NW 1st and 2nd.  A GPS is extremely useful, because the museum is bordered on two sides by both a river and an interstate highway; and on all sides by one-way streets.  Parking is available nearby in garages and lots, but their city-center rates are quite steep.  You can save a bundle by finding a parking spot on the street.  Even though you have to pay to street-park, that’s chump change compared to commercial parking venues. The commercial-lot deal-breaker for me was that the garage demanded that I tell them in advance how long I’d be parked—ergo, if I overestimated how long I’d spend in the museum, I’d be paying top dollar for a parking space I was no longer using, and if I underestimated, I’d have to skip some museum halls.  In fact, I would have underestimated, expecting to spend an hour or so, and actually spending all afternoon there, and racing through several halls as the museum was about to close.  The museum staff was happy to let us leave temporarily to reset the meter.   Obviously we weren’t the first visitors who’d needed to feed a meter.  On the other hand, if you do decide to park all day at a downtown commercial lot, you’ll be happy to learn that the US Bankruptcy Court is conveniently located just around the corner from the museum, should you unexpectedly need its services.  My estimated length of visit is more than 3 hours, based on you all being thoughtful adults; I don’t think small children would keep their interest in this museum for that long."
Two great current exhibits,November 2015,50,HistoryMiami,AmericanIxchel,If you are interested in street photography this current judged exhibit has some great images from photographers from around the world.  We didn't have time to go to the other half of the museum but will see it on our next trip.
I was disappointed that there was not more history,December 2015,30,HistoryMiami,LWL3333,"This museum adjacent to the public library in downtown Miami is located in 2 separate buildings on the same courtard.  One admission pridce covers both buildings, one of which is their permanent collection and the other houses changing exhibits.  While it is worthwhile to spend 90 minutes or so here, it left me wanting to know more about the early history and development before the 20th century."
Good Overview of the History of Miami,January 2016,40,HistoryMiami,diBiella51,It was a pleasant way to spend the afternoon. There is lots of information provided about the origins of this area and the exploration (and exploitation) by Europeans by now often told. But there is much to learn about the how the area was settled afterwards and drove people to build their dreams on. some of the displays are a little corny but I assume that many schools spend some time visiting as a part of a day  trip.  At the end of the exhibition one can see that it is a great story warts and all. We did go to the Photography exhibit across the plaza and enjoyed it very much as well.  All staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. Worth a
Free!,February 2017,40,Miami Metrorail,C7740XVjuliec,Great way to get to a lot of the downtown attractions of Miami. Only problem is that you have to stand. Very few seats. 
if you know where your going,December 2016,40,Miami Metrorail,carribbeanmic,This was a very inexpensive way to get to Miami.  The staff was very helpful with info for getting tickets.  The cars were clean enough.  The PA system needs improvement could not understand what the next stops were.  It is helpful to use smart phone or the website travel planner for direction.
Excellent Value,January 2017,40,Miami Metrorail,SagaloutsTour,"For only $5.15 you can travel all day on the Metrorail and buses, which allows you to go further afield than just Miami itself. Visit Coconut Grove or one of the shopping malls."
good bargain.,January 2017,40,Miami Metrorail,Intrepid_Traveler13,I use this train to get from the airport to Downtown Miami. It's a bargain at only $2.25 per person. The train cars need to be renovated though. They are old and dirty.
Miami Metrorail,January 2017,40,Miami Metrorail,Tony B,"The Miami Metrorail is a unique people mover in the downtown Miami section, because some of the paths cut through tall buildings. You will be elevated and gives you a different perspective of the downtown Miami scene. "
Historical Museum Tour,October 2014,50,HistoryMiami,carmen6233,Really enjoyed this historical museum. Bring the Family to learn all about Miami and South Florida. Interactive and very educational! Small but very interesting!
Great Museum but even better tours,August 2015,50,HistoryMiami,814RobertS,"As a history buff, I found this place to be excellent, well done and concise. Miami is such a different city in so many ways and this brings that to life. I was particularly enthused and impressed by the fabulous tours they offer on their schedule. Such things as a Miami Crime and Mayhem bus tour, a boat tour of Biscayne Bay and Stiltsville and a walking tour of the Miami Design District.  So far, I've only taken the walking tour of the Design District.  This was truly a gem!!  Done by a dedicated, professional, entertaining and knowledgeable guide. I can't recommend it highly enough.  The tour was priceless in that you would never have gotten that information together yourself. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
Amazing Traveling Exhibit,August 2015,50,HistoryMiami,Brent W,I would suggest starting with the Cuban exhibit as there is a pile of stuff to see in the museum and it is also fairly emotional. 
If you want to learn about Miami and South Florida,August 2015,50,HistoryMiami,JohnK329,"I am new to Miami, moved here last month, and wanted to learn as much as I can about my new home.  Books are great but this museum brings it all into focus from early times to the present day.  At this particular time, they have an incredibly moving special exhibition about Pedro Pan - 14,000 Cuban children were voluntarily given up by their parents to come live in American to escape the communist regime.  The largest movement of children refugees in history.  The even handed manner in which the exhibition was built, with no commentary on politics, made it all that more powerful.  Whether visiting or coming to live here, this needs to be on your list.  They also have great walking and water tours to places of interest in the area."
Pedro Pan,September 2015,40,HistoryMiami,Pat B,My daughter and I visited specifically to see Operation Pedro Pan - The Cuban Children's Exodus.  It was very moving.  The rest of the museum was nice but this particular exhibit was the highlight.
"Rather efficient, and rather easy to navigate",September 2016,40,Miami Metrorail,DGP1111,I can easily recommend Metrorail for your transportation needs when visiting Miami.
lack of security very unreliable,October 2016,10,Miami Metrorail,George D,"dadeland stations, are poorly maintained and managed. lack of security makes this service dangerous sometimes, station elevators dont work to retrieve you vehicle"
SCHEDULE IS HORRIBLE.,October 2016,20,Miami Metrorail,traveltrackers,They don't really follow a schedule so dress comfortably to wait. 
Extensive-Getting Dated,November 2016,40,Miami Metrorail,Robert A,"I really like the coverage and extent of the Miami Metrorail, especially that it connects to MIA and the MetroMover, MetroBuses and the TriRail!  Prices are excellent.  Drivers I met are great!  My only complaint is the complicated ticketing, inability to get qualified discount pricing from machines/no live ticket service at stations.  Miami, if you want to fix this, emulate Sydney, NSW, AUS metro ticketing!! "
I took the Metrorail from the Airport,November 2016,50,Miami Metrorail,sealcoater,I had to return a rental car that I rented at the Orlando Airport to drive home to Miami. I realized that I would need someone to pick me up at the airport in the middle of rush hour or return it the next day forcing me to have to have that same person take me to my house to get my car.  So I decided to take the Metrorail.  I have tell you how convenient it was and how quickly I made it from the Airport to Dadeland South where my wife picked me up. I would recommend it to anyone especially in rush hour.
Beatles exhibit is awesome!,November 2014,40,HistoryMiami,LovingSunandSand,"Check out the Beatles until January 18, 2015.  Great place to spend 2-3 hours!"
Stayed most of the day,November 2014,50,HistoryMiami,SteveAndJac,I must add that the staff were excellent especially the guy that took time to help us in the Beatles and photograph spaces.
Really nicely expanded museum - great docents - don't miss current Audubon,March 2015,50,HistoryMiami,Jerry J,"HistoryMiami has now expanded into the former site of the Miami Art Museum, and has two buildings.  They have wonderful artifacts and graphics depicting the colorful and dramatic history of Miami.  They currently have a display of the almost 500 original full size Audubon prints beautifully displayed.  And the docents are so helpful and knowledgeable.  This didn't used to be a ""destination museum"", but it is now!  We're going back."
"Interesting historical background of Miami encompassing 12,000 years ago to present",February 2015,40,HistoryMiami,VAChuck,The website does not drum up excitement but if you are going to come here review it for details of your tour.  http://www.historymiami.org/museum/
Excellent selection of Miami's history,February 2015,50,HistoryMiami,EdoSal,"My expectations were completely fulfilled. Excellent selection of key events of Miami's history. Very good photographs, funny memorabilia and quiet interesting remarks. There is also an excellent video about the early days of Miami. Don't miss it. I had been many times in Miami but I never visited this beautiful museum before."
"Free, but there is a reaon for that..",August 2016,30,Miami Metrorail,Andrew H,"Station really difficult to find and access. Many ""trains"" only one car so quite crowded. Slow and not that frequent."

"Miami needs to improve its Metrorail service, plus extend its service to more areas.",September 2016,20,Miami Metrorail,Oscar H,"The one really positive thing is that if you need to get to Miami International Airport, it is a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to get there--IF you live near one of the train stations, or have someone drop you off.  The Metrorail also now connects with the TriRail train, which you can take heading North.  The TriRail will take you to Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport."
Miami Metro Rail,July 2016,30,Miami Metrorail,NChardon1,The Miami Metro Rail will be a good idea to use at daytime while visiting Miami. Most of it is elevated from the ground and you will be able to see some of Miami's neighborhoods. It only Runs north/south. The great thing is it has a new line going to Miami International Airport. The fare is about $2.50 +- per person. 
Never on time,September 2016,20,Miami Metrorail,electlight,"Never on time, it skip the schedule, breaks frequently, stops in the middle between stations. Not good for commute unless you go with plenty of time. "
"Total overview of Miami's development, from Natives to the 90s",October 2013,50,HistoryMiami,foxsmjr,"HistoryMiami is one of most well presented museums in S FL.  The main permanent exhibit chronicles the development of Miami from the times of the Native tribes, through colonialism, up to the modern develop as a city from Henry Flagler.  Very interesting and detailed information for each time period with mock exhibits, recreations, and photos and artifacts.  I was really moved sitting inside the Buena Vista street car with the segregation sign still posted inside.  If you are a Miami Dade resident, visit the near by Main Branch library and request a Museum Pass, there are several museum throughout the county that participate in this program which gives residents free entry and HistoryMiami is one.  A good visit for the general curious, history buffs, or any resident looking to learn more about the hometown.  Great job guys !"
Visit this museum first,January 2014,40,HistoryMiami,UhlBliss,"This museum gives a concise and interesting picture of the history of Miami, from prehistoric time to modern development. We spent a couple of hours working our way through the history and the centuries. We enjoyed the sections on piracy, the Spanish American War, the building of the railroad, and modern day. A museum staffer whose father came from Cuba on an innertube boat added a note of immediacy to the immigrant story. Seeing this museum early in your visit to the area will make the rest of the time here more interesting. The museum is located next to the main library, which is also a nice place to visit if you're a curious type."
Well worth a visit,January 2014,50,HistoryMiami,Ed S,"For someone like me with a high level of interest in history, this place was like crack."
"Nice, but very crowded with groups",March 2014,30,HistoryMiami,MarcoDownUnder,"We visited this museum today and found it difficult to go around in a chronological order because there were many groups from schools that we had to avoid to get close to the exhibits. The employee at the cashier told us that it is pretty much like that all week long. However, the exhibits and pannels were interesting."
Not that interesting,March 2014,20,HistoryMiami,Jon1796,"Right next to dade county library, I wasn't too impressed... A pretty classic museum that covers natural history from the foundations of original inhabitants of the region. Great if you're a grade schooler in the region... Not so interesting for an adult who was hoping to see a display of post Batista impact on Miami. $8 entry fee"
A hidden GEM in downtown Miami,February 2015,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Yoly M,"A beautiful Catholic Church in downtown Miami. After you enter its doors you are WOWed by its grandeur and European architecture and style. The church carries its charms of years gone by...the wooden confessionals, the art work, the statues of Jesus, Joseph and Mary, the gold trimming, the altar...Pastor Father Eddy is amazing as well. A devoted and spiritual man. If ever you are in the area of Downtown Miami - look up "" El Gesu"" you will be happily surprised as you walk in to the house of GOD."
Old and well preserved,March 2015,40,Gesu Catholic Church,Joseph F,"Donated to the City of Miami in the 1800's this church has stood the test of time.  It is very well preserved and beautiful. Whether you want to attend services or just walk in and savor the beauty from times past, the church will welcome you. There are historical markers at the church that will add to the visit.  Located on the south east corner of NE 2nd street and 1st Avenue, it is very close to downtown Miami.  There is also a gelato spot directly across the street to enjoy after your visit.  Nearest Metro Mover stop is 1st Street Station just over a block away."
"Interesting material, poorly organized",May 2016,30,HistoryMiami,Matt F,"Overall, though, we were pretty happy.  As I said, we did learn a lot about Miami's history, which is the goal of the museum.  If you love history like I do, it's definitely worth a trip."
Nice museum for overview of Miami's history ,January 2016,40,HistoryMiami,diBiella51,A teacher who lives in the condo complex we were renting suggested a visit. We spent about 1 1/2 hours and enjoyed several parts very much. Would recommend for families and adult history buffs.
Sinatra Sings for You,May 2016,50,HistoryMiami,hope h,"I enjoyed the memorabilia- clothing and personal effects- supplied by the Sinatra family. The info includes a time line and photos of Frank through the years. Of course, there is plenty of his music available. Do catch the photojournalist, Tom Chapman's exhibit as well. Disturbing and powerful photos that will take you back to past horrors like Jonestown. See Sinatra afterwards to raise your spirits..."
Love this,November 2017,50,Domino Park,Tracey M,I loved the neighborhood friendly feel of this spot. The folks here were conversational with us sharing with us what they were doing and letting us take pics. It is a gathering spot for lovers of chess to play and hang out.
"Enjoy the Domino Park, and take photos",December 2017,40,Domino Park,lolinstar,"Nice neighborhood, and people.  The Cubans are alive, and fun! You can see them in action, and the neighborhood is so exciting, music, stores, markets, art galleries, worth at least 2 hours...but you can see it in one or less, too."
Heart of Little Havana,December 2017,50,Domino Park,Thomas V,Small park full of domino players for most of the day. This is the center of the Little Havana neighborhood and worth a look.
Only if you are down there anyway,December 2017,40,Domino Park,DebbyLA,"I wouldn't go to little Havana just to see this very little park but if down there anyway stop and see the friendly people playing dominos, chess and card games even though lots of gauching tourists."
Cute and interesting!,December 2017,50,Domino Park,Upekkhapr,"This is a typical landmark of Little Havana, Miami that has to be visited! Walking around Calle 8 you will run into it. Also make sure you visit the Little Havan Welcome Center for details about what interests you have! Enjoy the Domino Park!"
Beautiful Church,July 2015,50,Gesu Catholic Church,AlexandraMel,The services are always very nice. The building itself is really nice. The artwork inside is something special to see. 
Great place to worship in the middle of lunch break,April 2015,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Amarilys S,What an incredible place of worship in the middle of the bustling Downtown Miami tourist and corporate area. 
Traditional Catholic Church,May 2015,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Olga H,It's a beautiful old church in the center of Downtown Miami.  Mass is held several times a day in both English and Spanish.  
Excellent exhibits!,September 2016,40,HistoryMiami,Toby H,"We had some free time before our flight left on the day of our departure and were looking for something to do close to our hotel.  We visited the History Miami museum which was comprised of two buildings with separate exhibits.  The primary exhibit provided a great historical perspective of the area and how it developed over time,  They had one of the best collections of artifacts from sunken ships that I've ever seen and I've visited museums all up and down the NC/SC/GA coast line.  The second building housed more contemporary exhibits and an interesting exhibit about how sports helped shape the Miami area.  We spent much more time at the museum than we expected to and found it very interesting.  This would be a great rainy day activity or to fill a few hours before your departure flight.  Admission was reasonably priced at $10 per adult and the contemporary exhibit changes from time to time.  If you are a history buff or just want to learn more about Miami, you will enjoy this."
Opening Museum for Parker exhibit,September 2016,50,HistoryMiami,Alaindl,This was for the opening exhibit for Alfred Parker work. It was very interesting and beautiful design and architecture of homes here in Miami. I really enjoyed seeing this exhibit it's a good exhibit to show for the whole family.
Wonderful Museum to Learn about South Florida Culture,October 2016,50,HistoryMiami,Betty B,"OK, I am a bit prejudice because one of our former interns works here, but I have to say honestly that this is a well-done and informative museum with a Miami flare.  The rotating collections and special exhibitions are excellent, and there are lots of interactive activities for kids (of all ages) involving actually doing something with your hands, not just interacting with a computer screen.  Great for gaining a better understanding of this part of the US and its people and cultures.  Located right downtown and within walking distance of a lot of hotels, shops, cafes, etc. and the free People Mover train which is fun in and of itself to ride!"
Worthwhile visit,November 2016,50,HistoryMiami,MargaretJay,"We spent a morning here and learnt a lot about local history. Exhibits were very good, very informative, good explanations as to why and how things happened. Layout was very good. We did not spend much time in the temporary exhibits because we ran out of time but they seemed very good. The staff here were both pleasant and helpful."
Little Havana in a nutshell,January 2018,40,Domino Park,Mike D,"If you are stopping through LH, give it a look. Won't take you long and you won't be able to play unless you know someone, but it's kind of cool to see. But again, it's very small."
Not welcoming or very interesting for visitors,January 2018,20,Domino Park,CzWhux,"Maximo Gomez Park has been featured on TV, in travel guides and so on.  I was very keen to see it.  But it is just a very small, crowded park with some people playing dominoes.  You can't participate and there isn't much else to do.  It is an interesting cultural spectacle, but seeing it in person didn't give me any new insight.  All you're going to do is walk by on Calle Ocho and think ""oh yeah, that's dominoes park"".  They you're going to walk on and have a coffee somewhere.  It's not an attraction in its own right and it's really not worth a trip just to see it."
What A Neat Place!,February 2018,50,Domino Park,urbanguy,"It's what I would call ""culturally interesting.""  It's a part of Little Havana and not out of your way if you are just strolling up and down S.W. 8th Street (Calle Ocho)."
Just a Nice Place to Visit,February 2018,40,Domino Park,laurelboo,"We enjoyed talking to all the senior citizens that gather here to play board games. There are restrooms and drinking fountains available, too. "
Fun to watch the intense domino-playing and some chess,March 2018,40,Domino Park,Renee A,"We were fortunate to go during the Carnaval festival, where there was a tournament going on. The Mayor also showed up. One of the highlights of Calle Ocho, the main drag in Little Havana."
located in the cuban quarter,December 2016,30,Domino Park,madiestan,full of cuabn old biys playing board games and smoking cuban cigars.. worth a peek if you are in the area....
Igh!,July 2017,20,Domino Park,orly75812016,"Very disapointing; this place was closed at 8 pm by the time we got there,  it should be open later.."
Interesting Place to Visit,July 2017,50,Domino Park,869elizabethf,A definite get together place for those who love to play dominoes.  Everyone there is like family.  Very enjoyable place.
Community,August 2017,40,Domino Park,Nadav228,"My family and I stopped off at Little Havana and walked around on our own, as no one came to take us from the Big Bus tours. The Domino Park was filled with people playing the game of dominoes. It was an awesome sight. It promoted a sense of community "

Enjoyable!,March 2013,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,Miramar2009,"I took my 3-year old daughter to see Cinderella. The place is very nice and well maintain.  The show was supposed to start at 2pm, but it didnt start until 2:30.  It will be nice if they could be on time especially when this type of performance is targetting young audience: children."
A pleasant evening's entertainment,August 2013,40,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,NJArnfield,"This was our third visit to the Actor's Playhouse.  The production was well suited to a summer's evening - light, quickly paced, charming, with the hint of a message and a touching moment or two.  The dinner/theatre package that is available is an excellent choice.  "
Nice Theater and Shows,October 2013,40,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,LucindaR_11,"we have been members for many years.  We enjoy the productions and the look of the theater.  The staff is very friendly.  The only thing that could use improvement is the lobby bar, new items or a wider assortment would be nice."
"Great selection of beers, good service and atmosphere",April 2018,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,Kj2_12,"We tried a selection of beers which at first looked promising before I settled upon the Session IPA, having previously sampled the Havana and Lychee.  Staff were very pleasant and the place had a nice warm vibe to it.  Would recommend if you're visiting the Wynwood neighbourhood."
"Good fun, good range of ales",May 2018,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,sky0fblue,"A good fun craft beer brewery, one of several in the heart of Wynwood, serving an extensive range of ales. The beach-style theme includes a nice outside area, outsized games, and a fusball table. Good fun place, decent beers."
Beautiful,August 2015,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Nelson F,So beautiful. Loved the service.  Wish I was closer to go every week. Love the altar.  I have also attended a wedding here.  It was amazing.
I HAVE ATTENDED MASS AT THIS CHURCH MANY TIMES !!!,June 2016,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Frank d,"Before the Freedom Tower was converted into the Cuban Refugees Processing Center in the early 1960's, this church was the place all Cuban refugees would come to for help upon arrival in the United States. I volunteered here for several months unloading trucks with supplies to be distributed to the new arrivals. Of course I attended Mass here too. I remember there was a ""homeless man"" who would sing with such a wonderful voice that I would come to church just to listen to him. Many pleasant memories for me here."
Great Sunday Service,May 2016,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Ana A,The church was two blocks away from where I was staying. This was fantastic. I could attend Sunday service. The priest was very nice and inspirational. The church (construction wise) is a beautiful building. After that I stopped by there to donate some objects I did not want to keep and bring back home. They were very grateful. It was a nice experience
"Loved, loved the food!",September 2013,40,Shops at Midtown Miami,foodie305,"Go to Black Brick restaurant NE 1st Avenue Midtown. It is an excellent Asian restaurant. It is not rated as yet.

So many stores and places to eat,September 2013,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,Hollberry7,"If you ever break your screen on your iPhone or iPad there is a cart right outside of target that fixed my I thought lost cause iphone 5 for 90 bucks in less than an hr while I shopped, cash only accepted though.

Tons of variety from the best Italian in Miami, Brazilian upscale fast food, Sports bars, delicious Mexican food to the best soup & sandwiches in town. Stop and enjoy! Park in one of the garages and walk around before settling in on a great meal!"
Not something you see every day,March 2017,30,Domino Park,01_klynn_21,We enjoyed watching all the people playing dominoes and chess. These people definitely take their games seriously. I was surprised by the number of people playing. Definitely worth stopping by for a few minutes.
great experience,March 2017,40,Domino Park,Bulbe,how wonderful to see people enjoying each other at chess and other thoughtful games instead of playing computer games!
Cuban culture at its best,April 2017,40,Domino Park,Canesbiggdogg,Was driving around little Habana and stopped in to this historic site. There were a bunch of tables and a bunch of regulars sitting around and playing dominos. Was a nice afternoon hearing them speak and play.
Only in Miami thing,October 2016,40,Domino Park,S P,"Dive right into Miami""s Cuban community. Little Havana has been revitalized and really happening. Dont get hit by a tourist bus. If you can , check out monthly Little Havana art walk..."
Interesting to Visit,February 2017,40,Domino Park,WendyLauWong,"If you're in the neighborhood, this little corner park is worth a visit. There's a lot of character in this small, urban space. Lots of people gather here to play chess and dominoes, makes for an interesting 'bring your own' lunch spot. Grab something off Calle Ocho, eat while watching people play!"
Best Bartending Anywhere,May 2018,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Pat G,"Sara is an awesome bartender. The bar is large and comfortable. The native beer is excellent. Try the IPA and when you want a beer desert, have the coffee con flan made with their coffee stout."
"Good ales, nice place",May 2018,40,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,sky0fblue,"One of several craft beer places in the heart of trendy Wynwood brewing draft ales on the premises, it gets busy outside so we sat inside, but still a good atmosphere. It has a good selection of draft craft beers, it's table service but there is a long bar if you just want to sit on a stool and sup."
If you only have time for one Wynwood Brewery,May 2018,40,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,bagwags,Would return – our favorite out of the Wynwood breweries
Best Brewery in Wynwood,May 2018,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Gourmande_Errante,"I'd recommend the Belgian Gator Ale, but all brews are good."
Go now go often,June 2018,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,299lorraines,"We got a personal tour of the brewery then sat down for beers.  As we were enjoying, the owner brought over several other beers to taste. It was outstanding! The beer was great!"
Confusing and bad!,February 2018,10,Miami Metrorail,chrisjX2046PC,We were there from out of town and trying to get to airport.  We tried to get on at Government center and it was a joke.  The sign said to take Orange line.  There was no Orange line!  The sign said it would be arriving in minutes and then the train got there and it was a green line train.  So we waited another 20 minutes cause that is when the marquee said it would be there.  Well it never showed up!  We waited over an hour and ended up leaving to get a taxi.  Almost missed our flight.  Way to go to Miami!
State of the Art Transportation,March 2018,50,Miami Metrorail,pennski22,What an amazing way to move people around a city quickly. You travel in the sky with no driver and are whisked from one end of the city to the other. All cities should have these. 
Best way to get to the airport!,December 2017,40,Miami Metrorail,omirta,"Once I discovered this, I've never driven to the airport again! Why deal with Miami traffic, expensive parking, or pricey taxis?  For 2.50 the metrorail takes you right to MIA."
Quick Visit,June 2016,40,HistoryMiami,Ernest J,"If you're already downtown and have an hour to spare, this is a nice place to visit. Try to go on one of the frequent ""fee free"" days."
Civil War Reconstruction.,January 2017,50,HistoryMiami,John B,We traveled by Metro Rail to downtown Miami to History Miami for a  Seminar on the Civil War Reconstruction era. There were several speakers who  researchers  who had sturdied this era and had written several books. They gave the group present a well informed presentation.

Old Folks playing Domino Park,June 2016,30,Domino Park,J52Mesa,My uncle used to play here decades ago.  Do not make a special trip to see this tiny park. If you go walking among 8th street then stop by.  
These guys are serious.,February 2017,40,Domino Park,Steve_of_N21,"It’s not worth making a special journey to see but if visiting Little Havana, spend a bit of time here."
Pure Cuban culture,February 2017,40,Domino Park,Motorcyclebuds,Great place to watch local people interact with each other; plus its super close to lots of other Cuban American places of interest.  Lots of places close by for coffee and / or sweet pastries.

Birthday Celebration ,December 2017,40,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Beachtraveler62,We’ll be back for the Brewery Tour.
"Good beer, terrible service ",December 2017,10,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,ricardocolon,"The gripe that I have was the treatment I received from the two waiters.  I was there yesterday with a date.  We ordered the beer sampler with four small glasses, an additional sniffer of beer, and an appetizer which we consumed over a span of about 30-40 minutes.  Since we arrived their body language was indicative that we were not quite welcome.  At first, the waiter suggested I order some additional appetizers, which was fine.  While I said no, I thought at the moment I would stay a while and order more rounds and appetizers.  Then they were constantly stoppingl by to see if we wanted something more from the menu.  That would seem to the reader like good service, except that there was something in their harsh tone of voice, body language, and persistence that made their offerings and suggestions sound more like demands to us to pile more things to the tab.  After that first round, we knew it was time to leave."
"Cool bar, good food and beer",January 2018,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,KarenGilchrist,"We sat there all night. Cool indoor and outdoor seating. The Horchata Cream Ale (nitro) was by far the most delicious beer I have ever had. I had four and had to drag myself away. The pop up food was good- we had bun things, chips and salsa and burrito. Had veggie options. "
Girls trip,February 2018,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,April K,This brewery is pretty cool! Love that you were able to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather! Great tasting beer as well!!

Good to do on hot or rainy day,March 2016,40,HistoryMiami,tony2k1w,"The museum is easy to find downtown and is a good way to spend a couple of hours learning the local history with well laid out exhibits. Sometimes history museums can be a bit bland, but that is not the case with this one. If you are going to see it, I think it is a good thing to do early on in the trip as many of the other sights and places you will see around Miami will be all the more interesting because you will be familiar with their history."
Wow!  Who knew!,June 2018,50,Domino Park,cheech0515,Stopped here while on a tour of Little Havana.  I had no idea about the men playing dominoes and the history with it -
Interesting Little Park,July 2018,40,Domino Park,Illinois_John,"Stopped here to view the domino players.  There were also a couple of chess games in progress.  The park allows domino playing by members only.  However, tourists are allowed to enter and watch the games.  It was an interesting glimpse into this leisure time activity for Little Havana residents."
Happy to see this kind of things,June 2018,40,Domino Park,Naovice,"I like the old guys plays domino in the park, they enjoy and laugh when playing,  I'm happy to see that. you can try it if you are a domino player."

Never a bad seat.,August 2014,40,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,CTanis,"Okay, some shows are better than others.  We've been season ticket holders with friends for the past couple of years.  As a package with the neighborhood restaurants with plenty to choose from, we always have a great time.  Alone, the plays are either great or mediocre.  Still, we really enjoy the theater size and ambiance.  "
Always a winning performance for young and old!,April 2014,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,wanderingbliss,Great performances and variety of plays for young and old alike!

Great venue,December 2013,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,acielesz,Smaller intimate theatre for performances.  Always reasonable.  Near affordable parking. Check on line for performances.  
Small theatre filled with talent,December 2013,40,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,IngridHA1973,I went the first time to take my daughter for some acting classes.

When I travel especially in the south I have trouble finding a brewery that reminds me of home. I was really impressed with concrete Beach Brewery. They have a big variety of beers.

More than just a brewery,October 2018,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,journey_in_wander,"This is a great spot to hang out as well as a great brewery! They have great craft beers in new and interesting flavors. The vibe is relaxed and welcoming. Board games, dominos and other options to play while you enjoy the delicious crafts beers."

Beautiful and Breathtaking Church,July 2016,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Roadtripist,"Coincidently, we were there just a few minutes before that afternoon’s mass, so were able to experience a few minutes of it before leaving.  It was amazing.  Even the presence of the walls around us with the incense, made us feel more spiritual.  It’s something that you have to experience to understand."
Historic Site in the center of downtown Miami.,March 2016,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Ana M,"This is a beautiful historic site in the center of downtown Miami.

PARKING LOT IS NOT SAFE!,July 2015,10,Shops at Midtown Miami,C R,My family and I stopped here to grab a bite and parked inside. We had just arrived from NY and had luggages inside the car. When we came back they were all gone! The security was absolutely not helpful and there are no cameras to document what happened!! What are they charging for again???
Great Place to walk,July 2015,40,Shops at Midtown Miami,LJClark34,  There was a fountain and great art in the center of it all. Great place to hangout if you are visiting someone who lives in the Midtown area

Bob,June 2018,10,Miami Metrorail,Eric L,This thing's a joke it's broken never on time no wonder nobody rides it. They should just tear it down and start from the beginning. Too expensive and not worth it.
great way to get around and it's free,June 2018,50,Miami Metrorail,seaxprs2018,"Sure beats walking in our heat and humidity, quick and convenient in the downtown and Brickell area.  "
Metro Rail a joke,June 2018,10,Miami Metrorail,renenicolasa2018,"Miami dade metro rail is a damn joke. Never on time, non reliable, AC never works and non courties. It sucks that this is the only way of transportation to beat traffic but you are still late even trying to catch an earlier train. Even the new trains AC is garbage and they are never in route. Lucky if you get a new train vs an old one. Every stop it makes there is always a “we’ve stop momentarily” bullsh*t. Where is our tax payer money going to? Their pension plans, retirement, bonuses? How about a more reliable working metro rail. Piece of crap. Good luck for you travelers."
Horrible. From 1800's,July 2018,10,Miami Metrorail,Nano_BSAS,No maintenance. Dirty . Disgusting
Worth an afternoon of your vaca,September 2017,50,HistoryMiami,Sandra S,This was a great experience. A very comprehensive account and display of Southwest Florida. Children may not care for this one. 
Excellent historical overview ,October 2017,40,HistoryMiami,paulharhen,"We were very positively surprised. We hadn’t thought that southern Florida had a substantial history but it does, and this museum presents it perfectly. Well worth the $10 entry fee. There are 2 buildings. One is focused on the hurricane from 25 years ago. It’s the other one on the 10000 year history that is the better. "
Ugly area in downtown.Shady people around,November 2017,10,HistoryMiami,LynnM112017,Don't go there is nothing inside good that is worth it.The area is one of the ugliest in downtown.It's not really a museum.This is typical for Miami.
Get a concise history of the city.,January 2017,50,HistoryMiami,floresjr-josed,"This is a veritable encyclopedia of the area, tracing the timeline from the indigenous population to contemporary benefactors who laid the foundation for the city.  A must-see for the curious."
Super cool,February 2019,50,Domino Park,nixstix143,"Loved watching the locals at game. You won't necessarily stay long, but fun to see. Go and take a look."
A small part of Little Havana,February 2019,40,Domino Park,Track1089,Then Little Havana awaits you. 
Interesting game,February 2019,30,Domino Park,Lovetotravel2719,It was interesting watching the senior playing dominoes and how they get into game.  A bit of watching the game then walked over to eat ice cream.
Very unique atmosphere,February 2019,50,Domino Park,TomFarhias,"Great sight even for me who are quite familiar with Domino. It reminded me my grandfather who was addicted to the game. For children this is also a unique experience, and it was great to see some of the players asking my kids to paricipate and help them. Probably the best spot in little havana, as you really have the chance to be part of a local experience. 15 minutes shall be enough to have a feeling about it, but you can spend more. Highly recommended."
I love this theatre,June 2015,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,rosavega2014,"I go regularly to the Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre, particularly on the Saturday matinees when they have theatre for the younger crowd. I take my grandchildren and they are always fascinated. It seems impossible that such young artists can perform so well. It is very entertaining and educative at the same time. I highly recommend this theatre."
Great Venue Performances,September 2015,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,mariaf730,If you enjoy off-broadway plays this is very nice place to visit. Their new season is starting in October. prices range from $45-$55. The theater is not as large so you have a pretty good view from whenever you seat. Their is parking in the rear and you have plenty of restaurants you can choose to eat from before the show along Miracle Mile. The theater also shows kids plays and free movies on occasion. 
Authentic old Theatre,January 2015,40,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,TimenSpaceTraveller,"Whilst living in Coral Gables we past this place and saw they were showing a late-night showing of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"", so we went in. It's a lovely old place that has been kept in great condition, well worth a visit."
Awesome Performance,December 2015,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,hopeneverquits,We took out Granddaughters to see Narnia. It was great. All the kids loved it. Super impressed with the young talent on the stage. Thank you
Evening out with the girls,September 2018,40,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Adriana0502,"What a cool spot to hang out and they had a live band we walked in on Sunday and it was popping, they play the best 'old school' Cuban music. They place gets super lively with tourist and locals. It is fantastic for people watching! The older Cuban ladies come all dressed up and have amazing dance moves. The staff was very friendly and the drinks are a bit on the expensive side but who cares you are on vacation."
AMAZING,August 2018,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,midiala l,"If you are in Miami on vacation this is definately one of the best place to visit.  Not only does it have history, you can enjoy a cigar, have a cuba libre, and enjoy great dancing. The party starts on Thursday nights. The music is old havana, danzon, tangos, and many other great music. The drinks are fantastic. The energy is awsome. You can find people dancing in the sidewalks and just having a great time. Close to other restaurants, and the famous ice shop AZUCAR (Celia Cruz). They have flavors that will blow your mind.  The parking lot is a little difficult.There are meters in the street. Its a safe place to walk at night special Thursday, Friday and Saturdays when its the most packed. Cuba glory at its best. Bring your guanavera and your dancing feet."
Artistic excellence.,October 2018,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Paul U,"Located in Little Havana. Has bars with amazing range of rums, music area (trombonist playing jazz) and an amazing art studio with many wonderful works to view. Outside on the walls and pillars there are further artworks. A MUST VISIT."
Unique place!,November 2018,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Miamkd,We walked on Calle Ocho and stop by this beautiful museum! Cubaocho ia very unique place to visit. We talked to Pedro about the place and we were impressed. Next time we going for the live music! 
Sweet brewery ,January 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,colinwehrle,This brewery is really cool. The outdoor area is super nice and they have plenty of brews on tap. You can get glasses or flights. They had a sweet list of upcoming game nights and special events they had. Worth checking out for sure!!!!!
Great Spot with Good Beer,December 2018,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,nikkitay95,"This is a really cool Brewery found in the Wynwood section of Miami. They have an indoor/outdoor bar and true to its name, it is made of concrete. They have a good beer selection that rotates and the staff is very nice. Most nights they have different food vendors to get food from. They have a bunch of games for patrons to use and I love how the display art from artists in the area. The even feature local artists work on their cans, which is awesome! It is a great place to meet up with friends or go to after seeing the Wynwood Walls. I highly recommend Concrete Beach if you are in the Wynwood area!"
Delish!,February 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,oohl,"At this point of the afternoon, after Wynwood Walls, two light lunches each, drinks, and more touring about the neighbourhood, we were full up but still a bit thirsty. So two of us shared the tasting rack of four sample beers for $10 (!!!! cheap for healthy pours!!) and experienced beer bliss. All four were very different, some were pretty high alcohol content and I felt distinctly 'happy' and glad we caught an Uber back to our accommodation,"
Beautitious Ballerinas,October 2013,50,Miami City Ballet,defaultdisplay926,"First time my wife had ever visited a ballet. The Arsht Center was beathtakingly beautiful. and the 3 ballets which began the season( 2 choreographed by Balanchine , and one of these  to music by Tshiakovsky) were absolutely mesmerizing.  All of the performers nc from Corps de Ballet up thru the Principals, were spot on , and the synchrony, of both hand,and leg movements, were frankly unreal. When the final curtain fell, I was breathless. A must see"
Worth Seeing,October 2013,50,Miami City Ballet,hervipr,"We were able to get tickets for the Open Barre event with Chita Rivera.  The Open Barre events are always worth going to.  The room is small, so it is more intimate and the seats are very close to the stage.  Any time you can see the Miami City Ballet is a treat, but the Open Barre events are even more so."
HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE- LEFT STRANDED IN MIAMI,December 2013,10,Miami City Ballet,danib333,"I am sure the ballerinas and dancing would have been beautiful, however, the way in which the company handles itself is repulsive."
Seeing the Nutcracker in Miami,December 2013,50,Miami City Ballet,Queen_Marg0t,"I would imagine that very few families that come to South Beach end up booking tickets to the Miami City Ballet.  In fact, it was a perfect day at the beach when we went to see the Nutcracker on Christmas Eve.  And we are happy that we did as it was a beautiful production by a very strong cast of dancers that kept our 10-year-old captivated for 2 hours.  I would love to see more performances by this company. "
One of the few old Catholic churches in Miami.,July 2016,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Ivonne H,"This landmark located in downtown Miami is the oldest Catholic church in Miami.  It has recently been restored and the finished product is outstanding.  For tourists who like to visit churches, this one is a must."
A Treasure of Miami,March 2017,50,Gesu Catholic Church,vino,"We came across Gesu, since it was close to our Hotel. A beautiful old Church. School kids were in many pews this Saturday afternoon practicing for Communion. Monsignor had a great singing voice. Nestled among the streets and shops of old downtown."
A heavenly Daisy,April 2017,40,Gesu Catholic Church,luckyj_12,"A Beautiful small church located in downtown Miami, a peaceful oasis in the hustle and bustle of a busy downtown."
Delayed in Miami,January 2017,50,Gesu Catholic Church,marksJ2792TL,"Beautiful church. If your visiting Miami, its a must attend. The heritage, paintings, statues and stain glass are a must see. Service are scheduled in Spanish and English. The congregation is very welcoming. Unforgettable !! "
Miami Land Mark,October 2016,40,Gesu Catholic Church,arturod71,"The neighbour around it is not secure, you must be on the lookout arriving & departing. "
Really intersting even during the day!,December 2017,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Upekkhapr,"This place seems to be a very interesting place to visit at night with live music, but even during the day you can enjoy the art, the furniture and the nice people working there! Stop by and have a nice refreshing drink!"
"Nice place, but didn't like the music",November 2017,30,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,absuhr,"Nice bar with a lot of local regulars. The walls are full of paintings and photos, and a lot of sculptures and artefacts are present as well. When we visited the bar hosted an open mic of sorts, and I have to say that the style didn't suit my taste at all."
Didn't Expect to Find An Art Museum in Little Havana,February 2018,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,urbanguy,"We happened to be walking SW 8th Street and saw this place and went in.  The Art was varied, interesting, and much was very beautiful."
Nice place for a Mojito,March 2018,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,479LuisG,"We arrived early with 2 children... we could enjoy the atmosphere, had a mojito (water for kids :) ). It’s really a great bar, that remember a little bit the “best” Havana bars"
Piece of culture with a nice drink!,April 2018,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Peter F,"Paintings, furniture you see are (most of them) for sale also."
Nice Scenery,June 2016,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,kimberlytoby29,This location is very quiet and calming.  We had the best shopping experience at the shops at Midtown Miami.  We will be back soon.
Very nice,July 2016,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,Amclymon,I see midtown shaping into another south beach. Besides no free parking it's a great atmosphere a lot of shops and plenty of dining options. I'd rather be park on the street than in the garage but that's a preference I can't wait till everything surrounding is finished.
Great shops especially outlets,September 2015,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,Agata P,"Midtown is quiet new area with great shops especially outlets. You will find there Guess outlet, Ross, Marshalls, Home Goods..and some few more. Also good places to eat or drink you will find there. Everything is open until late so even in the evening hours you can go for shopping and have a good dinner. I have been there for 3 months so I know the area and shops quiet well ;)"
Great shopping mall,August 2016,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,Edda1,"I went to the Midtown Miami shopping mall. It has a gread selection of shops. Target, Nordstrom rack, Marshalls and Guess factory shop. I did a great shopping on lower prices than on South beach. I recommend this place for lower price shopping."
Midtown Miami has it all,August 2016,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,CeliaB392,"To sum it up, we had an excellent shopping experience and Midtown Miami."
Great spot for a date night,April 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Tine057,"Veza Sur was a great spot for date night. Awesome vibe, good food and their beers were delicious, especially No Reservations IPA. The staff was very friendly, restrooms were kept clean, Jenga games galore, DJ played an array of music from old school to current day jams....the perfect venue for a perfect evening."
Super Star!!!!!!!,April 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Marty M,From Madison Wi
Vezasur Br. Wynwood,April 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,kittysutens,Nice place to stop for a drink and also for lunch. A lot of beers to taste! Games for children! Good stop!
I tried only the sour,May 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,DylanEes,"Creative beer. I tried only the sour this time - two recipes. The Pim Pam Pom Pomegranate fresh light and a bit sweet. The Lulo Sour more dry, more sour. Both excellent in Miami humid heat."
The best of the Wynwood breweries,May 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,RichiePops,"After sampling several beers at all the Wynwood area breweries, which are all good, have to give a slight edge to Veza Sur. The beers are just a bit more creative and better brewed. The environment is the most comfortable of them all and the service is excellent."
easy to use,November 2018,50,Miami Metrorail,murff2015,"delighted that we were able to take the Metrorail directly from the airport to our hotel,at a fraction of what a taxi would have cost"
Awesome!!!,January 2017,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Esther G,Honestly it is great that this place exists. I love the atmosphere and the love that was put into designing and making this place. The people who work there are extremely welcoming and the drinks aren't bad. I'd say check it out.
"fun, funky,  a must buy mojito location !",February 2017,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Marilyn K,"Walk through the atrium to Guantanamera's Cigar/Coffee Cafe where samples of fresh coffee espresso drinks await if you ask, and a cigar to boot !  Would love to see this place at night bustling with people ! Will be back next year. "
Interesting combination...museum/bar,January 2017,40,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,WVCAgirl,"I would like to come at a different time.  I went specifically to see the art.  There was a wide range of pieces.  I was shocked to see it displayed with little protection from guest, which it appears could be eating or drinking right beside it.  There was a bar, but I was never approached or offered anything.  Still, I think it's definitely worth coming in. There are things I wish I had asked about and hope to return next time I'm in town.  I came at an odd time.  No performances or goings on at that time. It's right in the heart of Calle Ocho, which at this particular spot seems to be receiving a decent number or tourists."
Party,April 2017,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,oburns,"Wow what a great place!  The pace was amazing. The place has great art work, stain glass hanging lamps Tiffany style.  The bar uses old fashioned glass decanters to store the fruit juices for mix drinks.  The bartenders were super great the MOJITOS are to die for!  The live music was great they played all type of Latin ""dance"" music they have enough room to dance the night away.  I truly felt like I was transported to   Cuba a true experience if you down by Calle Ocho in Miami Florida. Stop by and experience the Cuban culture."
Best Rum Selection in Miami and quite a few other places around the World!!!!!,April 2017,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,pablosalvadorg,The late night partying is worth experiencing.
great riding around,November 2018,40,Miami Metrorail,ChrisThom666,"used this twice and was good , plenty of trains running smoothly only issue I had was with the day pass I bought the readers struggle to read if they are loaded onto mobile phones but attendants are at hand to help out so all good "
Frequent Service,November 2018,50,Miami Metrorail,CruiseEnthusiast,A frequent service from the airport to enable you to access many areas of downtown Miami.  Carriages are quite old and could do with a facelift but a good service nevertheless.
Making the Airport accessable,December 2018,40,Miami Metrorail,hereshow565,Getting to an from airports is always a problem but the ease of getting from downton Miami to MIA using the Metrorail is great.  There isn't even a surcharge to go to the Airport like Chicago to ORD.  If you want to avoid taxi or limo fares this is great.
A must for any fan of history,June 2018,40,HistoryMiami,Arielfl,If you are interested in history at all this museum is a must see. I really took the time to read the signs. For instance I did not know that by the time the US government got done forcing the Seminoles out of Florida into Oklahoma there were only 40 of them left. They fled into the Everglades where the government was unable to reach them. A very sad chapter of Florida history. This museum is not flashy or interactive but there are great stories and photographs here documenting important historical events. I enjoyed my visit immensely.
Interesting Museum with Fabulous Staff!,April 2018,50,HistoryMiami,VikkiBee,"What an interesting museum.  It’s split into two buildings with multiple exhibits in each.  Most of the exhibits are artefacts focusing on Miami’s subcultures such as the biking community, LGBTQ, the Cuban community etc.  There’s also artefacts dating back to the 40-60s, which were used in Miami, as well as photography galleries.  The main exhibit is on the top floor of the second building which focuses on Florida’s history from the creation of the Everglades after the ice melted to the different Native American tribes which have lived there for hundreds to thousands of years.  On my way out, I asked the girl, Eliana, working the admissions desk a few questions about the area.  She was so insightful about the history of so many things!  She gave me recommendations for places to try unique Miamian foods and we actually ended up chatting for 2 hours!  She’s a credit to this museum!"
Good overview of Miami history,June 2018,40,HistoryMiami,Travelfromessex,Unfortunately we ran out of time to see the temporary exhibitions. The place was extremely quiet on our midweek visit. Many thanks to the friendly and informative lady on the reception desk.
sail away,March 2019,30,Domino Park,juliak857,This is where you see some serious domino playing. There's many people playing and interesting to watch.
Must See,March 2019,50,Domino Park,Lori B,There are nice clean public restrooms in the rear of the park.
Nice place,March 2019,50,Domino Park,txde,They were very friendly and did not really care about the tourists paying by.
Great place to socialize with the locals,April 2019,50,Domino Park,bpask,Great place to watch all the domino games and the interactions with the locals.  Located right on the corner and easy to find!
Really local domino gamea,May 2019,50,Domino Park,StephenCr0ss,Great to see the traditional games played by the Cuban community. This place is a piece of real history.
The Cuban Rio Scenarium in Miami! ,September 2016,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,271isabelam,"The Cuban Rio Scenarium in Miami! Very good ambiance, with great art work for sale, good band, good drinks. Excellent choice for a night out! I have loved it!!!!!"
"Ñoooo, Azucar!",July 2016,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Raul A M,The most important thing that you must do if nothing else is to order a mojito. It's by far the best mojito in the world. Not even in Cuba can they make a mojito this good. It's not full of sugar which is always a common mistake. Que Bòla hacere or better yet as Pitbull so eloquen likes to say... Dàle!
Very different but Excellent,July 2016,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,lorcanm842,The back area is delight too
"Antiques, music, rum collection and a bar in one stop",July 2016,40,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Jeffrey S,Well when you walk in it's an eclectic mix of antiques music and a bar.  Not sure how else to explain it buts it's a fun place to have a drink and soak in the neighborhood
Perfect place for a rest and for fun,August 2016,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Hugo d,"We had the impression we really have found the best attraction of Little Havana, and we just did not want to go out!"
Actors Playhouse,August 2016,40,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,387indy,"The Miracle Theatre production of 'Buyer and Cellar', stars Chris Crawford, he plays a host of famous people, including Oprah Winfrey, Bea Arthur, James Brolin, even Barbara Streisand. In the play Barbara Streisand turned the basement of her Malibu mansion into a shopping mall. An out of work actor takes the job as the sole employee of the mall."
An Amazing Night,October 2016,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,Mariemma B,"It was a thrill night to spend sometime watching ""MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET"" which is a Tony® Award-winning Broadway musical inspired by the famous photo and phenomenal true story of the famed Sun Records Memphis Studio recording session by Sam Phillips that brought together rock ’n’ roll revere Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins  for the first and only time in their careers. The young actors who play the characters revive these great musicians with their talents and witty. The play is superb and if you get to see it from October the 19th through January 1 2017, you'll have a great time."
Million dollar quartet ,October 2016,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,434cathye,"Absolutely fantastic. You would swear Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash were on stage and nailed it!   Carl Perkins was great but i am not too familiar with his work. Elvis,what can i say about Elvis!  Close your eyes and Elvis WAS in the building!  The entire cast ROCKED!  Narrator  Sam Phillips, owner of Sun Records, fabulous!  I felt like i was seeing a  Broadway production.  At the end of the play you felt like u were at that jam session in Sun Records studio!"
Exhilarating evening - Million Dollar Quartet,November 2016,40,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,Barbara M,"The Miracle Theater is a lovely, restored 1940's movie theater which has been divided into 2 floors. The original balcony is now a separate and quite intimate theater. This was the setting for Million Dollar Quartet. We felt as if we were in the midst of the action. It is a spirited musical about a jam session with Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. The music is great and the energy is fantastic. The actor playing Johnny Cash sounded so like him, it was amazing! The antics by Jerry Lee Lewis while playing the piano were astounding! The acting was quite good, especially by the characters of Dyanne and Sam Phillips. My 20 something niece was sure that she was the youngest member of the audience by more than a decade, but this did not mean that the musical is only for those who grew up with this music. She loved it. As did I!  Million Dollar Quartet is currently playing through January 1. We got our tickets the morning of the performance."
A fantastic night!,April 2019,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Cabos,"What a great discovery. This places brings Cuba alive. They offer the largest selection of different rums in the world. Live music traditional and top class. Staff very friendly. Atmosphere is fantastic, Full of rhythm and dancing. Prices usual for Miami but well worth the visit. "
Grown up time,May 2018,40,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Gina T,"I saw Cubaocho online but was enchanted when I got there. We loved the envirinment, music and vitality. I recimmend it ti all that go to Miami!"
A rare and unique bar - one of the best in the world,June 2019,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,CulinaryHurricane,"I love and cherish this place. From the antique furniture that everyone is allowed to sit on to the amazing collection of Cuban art ranging from the 1850s to 1959, this bar is like no other in the world. Their rum collection is unrivaled and the staff always treats us with respect."
Great place for live music 🎶,June 2019,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,chemikajhoward,"The live band on Saturday nights was awesome! Traditional Cuba food is served so go eat, drink and dance all in one spot!"
Rum Tasting and Pre-Revolution Artwork,June 2019,40,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,MSY-Pappy,"Very Authentic location, which is a must see in the Iconic Miami neighborhood of Little Havana.  The people were friendly and the place is a feast for the eyes, with numerous artworks reflecting the pre Communist days of Cuba.  The owner, if you meet him is a well of information and wit.  It has a great bar and feature live music, although I don't know the shedual."
walking down south beach ....,December 2018,50,Sobe Is Love,maria vittoria d,"Walking in the heart of Miami Beach you can find this permanent art work that represents perfectly the ""South Beach"" mood in an amzing and colorful way, for sure it will become the City Brand in future."
A Must thing to do if you are in South Beach,December 2018,50,Sobe Is Love,belliste81,Nice Concept and Nice Artwork for Miami.
The best place to take a picture in SoBe,December 2018,50,Sobe Is Love,Solschettino,It’s an amazing spot to take a souvenir picture in SoBe. Very impactful structure and stunning color. Pictures come out just perfect ! 100% recommended.
Interesting beer,May 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,MaryT98,"A nice brewery in a sketchy area.  Make sure you go with friends.  The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable.  Have a flight, so you can taste a variety of styles. They have snacks.  They usually have a good truck, and there are food places all around."
"Loved it the first time, not so much second time",March 2016,30,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,78JorgeF78,"I visited this place with my fiancé a few months ago, we had an incredible time. We decided to go back again last week. We were bored. It was a Friday night and the place was dead. We know exactly why, the DJ absolutely stinks. People kept on coming in and out of the place, they would come, sit for a few minutes and then leave. Why? the music, its horrible. The DJ has no clue who his audience is, he plays music that is not what the visitors to that place want to hear. HELLO, CUBAOCHO? we go there to listen to Latin music, salsa, merengue, bachata. Instead, he plays stuff no one wants to hear or identifies with. I DJ back in the 80s when I was in college and the first lesson I learned is, ""read your audience"", play what they like, if they are dancing, keep playing that style, if they sit down, change it quickly. He does not get that. My advise to management is, get rid of the DJ and find someone that knows about who you are and who the people that visit you are, we are mature, professionals, We don't want to hear Pitt Bull all night, we want to hear Celia, Merengue, Salsa.....also, since the name is Cubaocho, you may want to suggest he researches what Cuban music is like. Also, the bar tenders leave a lot to be desired, the mojitos were inconsistent all night, the first one was LOADED with Rum, the second, it was a lemonade, the third, tasted like a rum and coke. Get professional bartenders and a professional DJ. The service was very good thought. We will return to see if anyone reads this post. There is a bar right up the street that was packed, Ball and Chain.....everyone was dancing and having a good time, everyone in Cubaocho seemed bored. Hey management, pay attention to your place or you wont survive. Its a cut throat business, you are not paying attention to it."
Great atmosphere and art works/ambience,March 2016,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,jidoo,"This place is a cafe/bar and arts/performance center that you must see. It's filled with great artwork and the design of the space is very rich and elegant. Not sure about the food or coffee scene, as I was there at an off hour. But plan ahead to catch some musical performances and support great art in the otherwise gritty scene of Calle Ocho"
What a Fabulous Night of Latin Music!,April 2016,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Barbara L,"We were in Miami for 3 nights and had looked for a live club, but could not find anything online.  Happily, when we did our walking tour of Little Havana as part of our Big Bus package, our guide took us in here and said that we should come back for the live music.  We are so glad we did!  The Cuban exiles who make this corner of Miami home have such a ""joie de vivre"" and it was on display in full swing here and all over the streets of Little Havana.  Perhaps I am happy that this is not more widely advertised - it was crowded enough without ads!  We will be back!  A night to remember!"
Pleasantly surprise by the atmosphere,April 2016,40,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Mariemma B,This is a great place to go to listen to music and have some drinks.At the time we visited they have live Cuban music.The bar seems to be well stocked. You can seat outside if you want to grasp what Calle 8 is all about or in their courtyard or you can seat inside and admire the creative environment and the innumerable pieces of art to admire and enjoy. The place is fairly new and the concept is interesting. We didn't eat and I cannot testify to that part of the business.
great music,March 2016,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,jrios4444,"if any body would have told me that I would be partying in calle ocho to a rock band I would say they were nuts , this place is amazing the rum collection is worth checking out"
Drop by Concrete Beach after visiting Wynwood,May 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,882lukasm,"Decor, atmosphere, beer and nachos does not disappoint."
Beeeeeeer,May 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,NatandPidge,"This is a very stylish place with a fantastic selection of beer. The beer flights are a great way to sample a range of beer on offer. Beer and sunshine, what more do you need?! "
Great hangout spot,June 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,gregoryr634,Came with my friend to hang out and love the layout of the place.  Have alot of games to play and we ended up doing 4 flights of beer while playing dominoes.  Beers were decent but I would come back just to hang out and have a cold one.
Disappointing,July 2014,30,Miami City Ballet,LucianaGualda,"This beatiful and traditional school seems not to care about visitors. Our previous emails were never responded and even after we were there, no visit was permitted. They had a few reasons, but not enough to dismiss a teenager who crossed the continent in order to have the experience."
Ballet espana,November 2014,50,Miami City Ballet,DrPatty,The hall is lovely and although large has excellent seating.  Both lodge and second and third tiers excellent.  The ballet espana was doing an integrative piece that was beautiful.  Stage is large for major numbers. Nice set up for drinks and snacks.  Good ventilation in hall. Location excellent and even walkable from city center hotels. Near arena for Heat and near park and bay..  Excellent venue.
Amazing show,October 2014,50,Miami City Ballet,Vero L,i just wish they make the check in  process (ticketing) electronically as to avoid wasting time waiting in line to retrieve tickets for will call
Romeo and Juliette,October 2014,50,Miami City Ballet,Cubana31,But I do miss the Edward Villela touch!!
Think twice if you are a true ballet fan,December 2014,30,Miami City Ballet,Sunny-Susanna-P,This was the first ballet where I saw people actually putting their legs up onto the balcony railings during the performance. Of other annoying things worth noting are clapping every now and then when people just felt like it without taking no notice of music. The performance I came for was Nutcracker and even though there was an orchestra pit instead of orchestra there were 4 big amplifier placed. The performance itself was ok.
Gesu Catholic Church,December 2017,50,Gesu Catholic Church,amaliad2013,"Situated in downtown Miami, it is a historical Roman Catholic Church, with full service.  Great for residents and workers in the downtown area"
Gesu Catholic Parochial School and Church.,July 2017,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Dollfan56,I went to Gesu Catholic Parochial School and attended Mass there and made my 1st Communion. There will never be another Church that moves my heart like Gesu!
Italy in Miami,December 2017,50,Gesu Catholic Church,midiala l,"The oldest and most beautiful church in Miami.  This is a most see in your list of places when you travel to Miami.  This church has been added to the historical socitety.  This church has been in Miami since the late 1800's.  Actually reconstructed by Henry Flagler. If historical places  and churches are your thing, then I highly recommended this church.  Its like going to a cathedral in Italy, just built in Miami.  This used to be an old wood house back in the 1800's.  It was the first catholic school in Miami.back then. This church is not in a good area, Please visit only in the day time and if possible during the weekdays.  The church does open early and its open until 4pm.  There are masses during the week, sat. and Sunday.  This church is located the downtown Miami which has good places and bad places.  Always stick to the crowd when walking.  During the week there are lots of business people, police and protection.  Some places are open on saturday in this area while many are closed.  Sunday not a good idea to walk around this place since everything is closed.  No activities lots of homeless people.  Parking lot can be a problem, you must pay for it.  Better idea to go with someone that know the area.  Beautiful experience."
my kind of Catholic Church in Miami,August 2018,50,Gesu Catholic Church,ALICITA14,"Very old Church that is a history landmark for Cuban exiles from the 1950's and 60;s. plenty of space to observe Mass  comfortably, love the priest, meaningful sermons. A good sample of old Miami Architecture in downtown Miami"
Amazing place and over the top mojitos,September 2015,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,78JorgeF78,A must if you visit Miami or if you live here. The place is right in front of Dominos Park...how much more awesome can that get?

A gem at Calle Ocho,March 2015,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Yoly3140,"This has been renovated and they did a great job.  Lots of memorabilia, cozy and excellent music.  You can sit outside in the patio, inside at the bar or in one of the beautiful sofas or chairs.  A very nice place to spend an unforgettable evening, and don't forget to put on your ""guayabera"".

beuatiful Church great temple for worshipping,September 2018,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Jayme P,"Gesu is, I think one of the oldest churches in Miami and reminds me of European temples where it shows classical architecture of old churches. great place to feel connected with God and for Praying."
Gorrin Bros Hat Shop,February 2017,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,hope20172017,We stopped in to check out the hats!  Not only did I leave with an amazing hat I wore to the boat show but Israel was so friendly and helpful with suggestions about restaurants and other attractions in the area!

Great option solo or with friends,June 2017,50,Shops at Midtown Miami,EventPlanner_7186700,"This mall was recommended to me on a very rainy day by the bellman at my hotel. However he got it wrong he told me that it was enclosed so it was a good option for the rain but it's actually not enclosed. In any case I'm glad I went. They have Ross, Nordstrom rack, and Marshall's and some other big box stores in addition to some boutiques. Great place to go have lunch or dinner. Lots of restaurant options in every price range.if you're staying at the Hyatt, Marriott or Doubletree that are all near each other there is a free trolley that takes you right to this location and will bring you back. I believe it runs until 11 PM."
Perfect place for shopping! ,August 2017,40,Shops at Midtown Miami,LLWTravels,"I love this place for two reasons: great vibes for shopping and awesome deals. There are great selections of restaurants to go to and stores that you want to visit - Marshals, Target and Ross. If you have time, stop by the Venetian spa! It's perfect for a me-time. "

Get Cafe Con Flan!,July 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,DBernard1029,"I’ve gone to Veza Sur a handful of times and I’ve always enjoyed it. They serve some great beers, but most notably is the Cafe Con Flan. I live out of town and literally crave them! They have both indoor and outdoor seating and were able to accommodate our large group most recently, even on a busy night. Great atmosphere as well. Definitely a place to go in Wynwood! "
Cool Brewery in a Cool Neighborhood,August 2018,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,109ChrisM109,"In conclusion, if you want lively atmosphere, good beer and variety, and a spot reflecting the non-tourist Miami, Veza Sur is a fine starting point."
Wood brew,August 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Gasndy D,"Best latin brews in wynwood. Make sure you stop by and taste miami. Atmosphere is vibin.

When is it open?,September 2015,10,LGBT Visitor Center Miami Beach,HMS46,"After an unhelpful visit at the nearby Art Deco ""Welcome"" Center, I suppose it was not our day to visit South Beach vistor centers."
Fascinating Place,February 2015,40,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,bethpindc,"This is a fascinating bar/art gallery with millions of dollars of Cuban art well worth seeing.  They have a nice courtyard as well.  They make a very good traditional mojito so this was a nice place to rest after exploring the neighborhood for several hours.  Service, however, was pretty slow."
Nice Cuban-style environment ,February 2015,40,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,000_Roger_000,"Waiters are friendly, appetisers are good and great spot to appreciate a bit of Cuban culture. Good place to smoke a cigar and enjoy few hours of chatting with friends. Recommended."

Great Stop for LGBT,April 2016,50,LGBT Visitor Center Miami Beach,L920DZbillb,"WHile in South Beach, stopped here to get the ""low down"" on the LGBT community in the area. Most welcome and helpful."
Add this to your to do list. It's worth a visit.,November 2015,40,LGBT Visitor Center Miami Beach,antoinjstrachan,"It's been a while since I was at the Visitor Centre. If you're staying in Miami Beach and want to find out more about the LGBT culture and history of the area - as well as what to do today - you should pop in. The centre is across the street from Twist, so you already know how easy it is to find. "
Warm and friendly place to get local and tourist info,June 2016,50,LGBT Visitor Center Miami Beach,rickymiabeach,"They have it all here. A great place to stop for community magazines, organization info, what to do and where to go in South Beach and beyond. Definitely a must-stop-by."
"Small network, easy to use and it's FREE!",August 2018,40,Miami Metrorail,eseer1001,"Great way to see some of Miami Beach area.  Its' free and very easy to use.  It's not a big Metrorail system, but It was great for taking the weight off your feet for awhile.  Great for small children.  Get's busy during peak times."
Great free tour of Downtown Miami,February 2019,40,Miami Metrorail,Tracey K,The metro rail is cheap and eliminates the need for a car.It is easy to buy a pass and for just under $6 a day you can travel from the airport or Hialeah all they way to Dadeland. It connects to the MetroMover which is free and it takes you on a beautiful tour through downtown Miami. It also has free WiFi.
Free Ride,March 2019,50,Miami Metrorail,majellan03,Cheapest way to see the entire city - FREE
We have new trains - but things are always delayed,May 2019,20,Miami Metrorail,SUSANA E,The trains are now coming as they should - instead of every 12 minutes - they now come every 5 mins during rush hour.  After rush hour (about 10:00 a.m.) all the vagrants seems to ride the trains - some are aggressive - some are on drugs - sleeping on the trains - asking for money.  As to the airport - I would not recommend taking the trains - to or from the airport -again - too unreliable and homeless/criminals preying on tourists.  Please be careful - sadly - Miami needs to revamp its transportation system.  The buses are no better - only during rush hour are they sort of reliable - after that - the vagrants come out.  As to wi-fi service onboard?  Good luck with that.  I gave up trying to connect years ago - I just use my mobile service.
Blessing for people of Miami,September 2018,50,Miami Metrorail,foodtester214,used few times for going to Downtown Courthouse .. wooow was so easy and money saving . made my work easy and saved tons of $$. will recomed to all 
Part of Art Basel,December 2018,50,HistoryMiami,c3a3m3,HistoryMiami is a great Museum that provides the foundation of the creation of Miami.  Parking at the Miami-Dade Cultural Center Parking Garage at (50 NW 2nd Avenue) is a flat $5 if validated at HistoryMiami.   I saw Frank Sinatra in 2016 but now there is an exhibit which is part of the Art Basel event.   While some exhibits are permanent I found different items on the 3 different times that I visited.   They change the exhibits often.  Enjoy the photos.
A hidden gem in downtown Miami.,December 2018,50,HistoryMiami,Joe N,"This two-bujilding museum covers the colorful and interesting history of Miami very well.  I expected to spend a half hour here and was instead so fascinated that I lingered for two hours.  The location -- right next to the Government Center MetroRail and MetroMover stations -- could not be more convenient.   The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Give it a try for ""something different"" in Miami."
Great Museum,January 2019,50,HistoryMiami,XavierNY,"I wish there was a gift shop, maybe there was but I didn't see it."
A great night!,September 2012,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,MIA-2-TheWorld,"We were here for the Latin Jazz Violin Festival and it was an unforgetable night. The customer service, both over the phone and at the place, was fantastic. My fiance' plays the violin so we were very furtune to see such a great show on Saturday night with Federico Britos and Nicole Yarling. We truly enjoyed the night and such great talent. Waiting for next year festival....."
Amazing Place,February 2014,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Ruby80,"We accidentally missed the bus back and had to wait 30 minutes for the next one and so stumbled across this place for a beer.  They gave us lovely authentic Cuban beer and we chatted with lots of the locals.  The place itself was beautiful, decked out with really expensive, interesting  paintings and furniture and even some of Frank Sinatra’s furniture. They had a little courtyard in the middle with a little fountain also. We were advised they had excellent dance nights here, and music nights and was a shame we didn’t get to go to one. The lady behind the bar was really friendly and all together this place was one of the highlights of my stay in Miami.  Needless to say we missed the next 4 buses before leaving to get one of the last buses   (by the way the photo above that someone has posted is not the same place)"
Beautiful but Clueless,April 2014,30,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,Elena I,"If you have a Groupon,  beware.  If you're going to eat, you might consider eating elsewhere, and if you're into wine, just know they are not.  Our red wine was warmer than a Miami summer day."
Time Machine!,July 2019,40,Domino Park,LWRFL,Seeing Domino Park was like going back in time via a Time Machine!  To watch these people play and strategize was a real eye opener into a culture past - and present. I really appreciated this stop - maybe you will too.
A Fun Local Activity for People That are 55 and Up,June 2019,50,Domino Park,Tiffany_Horton,"On a tour I learned about the strict rules that are in place for this activity to be available for the local seniors who are age 55 and up. I am glad it is run with respect, and is available for the local people to meet and spend time together doing something they enjoy. :-)"
Need to visit,July 2019,40,Domino Park,597elsar,I stood watching the old foggies play and enjoy the day away. You have to be at least 55 to play. You’d probably have to have connections before you can play. All the seats a full. 
Fun and free to watch,August 2019,30,Domino Park,jbwhitehouse,"Walking to this square one can enjoy the sights and sounds of these domino enthusuasts.  Alas all the signage is in Spanish; we did not understand much, but it was fun to watch."
Finally an awesome theater!!,February 2018,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,Rudolf H,Parking is always painful in the big city of Miami.  There is a paid garage near the area where the rates are reasonable.
Wonderfully talented performers,March 2018,30,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,halikiki,"Cute venue, small and intimate.  For the price, the technical glitch with the microphone on the lead female was unfortunate.  ""Once"" was a great love tragedy and the music was great."
Once More with Feeling!,March 2018,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,Marsha L,This is the second time I have been to this theatre and it seems to get better each time. The musical Once was playing at this historic theatre on the Miracle Mile in Coral Gables. Parking is easily accessible behind the theatre. Lots of restaurants and shops around to keep you occupied until curtain time. The seats were comfortable and I don't think there is a bad line of view in the house. The production we saw was top notch and had me tapping my toe. All around it was a great night out.
Million Dollar Quartet,June 2018,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,hlanthony,The show was amazing. Fabulous. 2 hours of pure fun. The jam session at the end was the best and very uplifting that everybody on their feet. But especially especially especially Jerry Lee Lewis he got his on her feet plus he was humorous and put a lot of humor into the shower. Jerry Lee Lewis was my favorite
Outstanding Show!!!!,June 2018,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,maggie5963,"Amazing cast, really good and entertaining. The fact it was in a smaller theater made it better, seeing  them up close and never miss a thing. Highly recommend, loved it."
Weekly thang,March 2018,40,Frost Museum of Art,LulaBK,The museum is a highlight for any visit. I feel fortunate to have it in my backyard!
A Must See!,June 2018,50,Frost Museum of Art,Annalisad65,Admission is free and parking is available in several lots and garages close to the museum.
Very good for kids any age. Best if you take all-young kids or all-older kids.,August 2018,40,Frost Museum of Art,Jose Andres D,"Me and my wife went with our 2 kids (a 5 yr old girl and 12 yr old boy) and 2 of their cousins (6 yr old girl and 10 yr old boy). The little girls got bored if we started to watch one of the many educational videos, so the older boys could not suck up all the great info that the Museum has to offer. But overall the experience was great. We got there at almost 3pm and we had to run on the laste exhibits. Try getting there sooner and with already lunch in your belly (we had had already lunch when we got there). Highly recomended. Oh, one other thing. We were expecting a indoors museum so my wife and I went in pants. Better off in shorts and light clothing. Exhibits are under AC but a lot of things (and all connecting corridors, stairs and elevator) are not. So no pants are required."
Everyone should Go,August 2018,50,Frost Museum of Art,TobyBlades,"We went to the Frost Museum with another couple,  we were there for hours.  We missed so much of the Museum that we are going back.  Lots to see and do. We sort of got mesmerized by the aquarium part of the museum.  The planetarium was wonderful also.  Not sure how we missed 3 floors of other exhibits but we did.  Very interesting place.  We took the Brightline down to Miami and then the people mover to the museum.  Best time"
"Glad I went, but won't go back.",May 2018,20,Frost Museum of Art,scastleman1,"My family took me for the first time, for Mother's Day 2018.  I was so'ooooo excited because I have never been and wanted to go since it opened.  Well.... I came, I saw, I was happy I went, but I won't being going back.  It was boring.  There are three things to see there that are cool, but nothing else."
Surprising,November 2019,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,KayeS111,"I saw this was a museum and performing arts centre and I was waiting for my husband to finish a cigar so I thought I would open the doors and check it out, and it was a bar!!  I was completely surprised.  It is really well set out, I loved it.  The drinks were great as well.  I would certainly recommend going here."
A relaxing view at history,October 2019,50,Cubaocho Museum and Performing Arts Center,ElsieN99,This is the property that was owned by the brother who created Viscaya.  It is a much more relaxed comfy home.  Don't miss the wine cellar and the bakery.  It is also a wonderful place to get a view of the sunrise.  Look for the Seafood Feast when it comes around.

It is it's title!,September 2018,50,Sobe Is Love,Dana C,SOBE is love!  Washington St. is a wonderful pedestrian way to watch the dog walking training classes where the dogs are taken into the shops and on the elevators and even have bowls of water put out for them by some shop owners as they and their trainers enjoy lunch at one of the many restaurants along the way.  People watching is undescribable so keep your eyes opened!
No Longer there!!!,August 2019,10,Sobe Is Love,ReneeSaliba,"If it is then I must be blind but I went there 3 times, walked the entire area, searched online for news of the new location but NOTHING. all bus stops are called ""Sobe"" but its not there! I was soo looking forward to this even if it is just a sign but the meaning of why it was made means a lot to me. I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!"
Confirmed- installation removed.,August 2019,50,Sobe Is Love,11DubsL,Hope it makes its way back soon!
Beautiful parking garage - excellent location and access,October 2017,40,1111,JCP1212,Architecturally the most extravagant parking garage you'll ever park your car. Excellent location on Lincoln and Alton road across from the movie theaters.

Lovely exhibits,May 2017,50,Frost Museum of Art,markmd,"The Frost does not have a huge selection, but what they do have is well presented in a lovely setting. The Australian women modern Aboriginal art is particularly appealing. While there, don't fail to look at the outdoor art which is quite spectacular."
Science or art museum?,May 2017,40,Frost Museum of Art,adlr99,I do agree with the comment about the very expensive parking. You are really forced to use the onsite garage. We were there 3.5 hours and our fee was $20.
Fun time,June 2017,40,Frost Museum of Art,Thebignate5,A lot oriented towards little kids but overall still a really awesome time. Buy tickets in advance so you can see a planetarium show. It was the best part. 
First time visit,June 2017,50,Frost Museum of Art,ireneo631,Went to the Frost yesterday with my daughter for the first time since purchasing the family membership. It is beautiful!!! There is a big marine/aquatic presence plus space and body health science. The museum opening had big expectations for Miami resident and it does not disappoint. The building is modern and the exhibits are beautifully done.  I did not do the planetarium this time around but will do it next visit. 
Mwah,May 2017,30,Frost Museum of Art,isabellaguevara,Very little to see. Done in less then 30 minutes. I was not very impressed. Its far from town.not much of a museum.
Absolute worth seeing,November 2018,50,1111,PetriKoo,If you go to Lincoln road mall then walk few blocks further and you can see this great building. Must visit if in area.
Striking and Unusual,February 2019,40,1111,TheExplorerFamily,"The building was referenced on the Tour buses, as well as on the Duck Tour that we took. It has become a landmark and quite a tourist attraction for photographers. It is beautifully lit up at night, and worth a visit, at least once."
Nice,November 2018,40,1111,BigoBoca,This building is a unique architectural phenom on Lincoln Rd. The restaurant and the vistas from the roof are unique. 
"Great Beer, Great Ambiance",March 2019,40,Concrete Beach Brewery,suzikay1,Loved this place! A very casual environment where you can stop and have a beer while checking out all the murals in the Wynwood district. I tried several beers and like them all.
Great find,October 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,PaulGrr,Strongly recommended for when you've had enough art and need a decent brew (or two)!
Our favourite in Wynwood,October 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,Beanie14,"We loved this brewery previously and after visiting some others this time, this is definitely our favourite.  The beers are great and the staff are so friendly.  There's a lovely chilled out atmosphere.  Love the merchandise too, our selection of tshirts is growing."
Best brewery in Wynwood,December 2019,50,Concrete Beach Brewery,xzmattzx,"A beer show in Philadelphia said this was the best brewery in the Miami area.  It's a block away from J. Wakefield and Veza Sur, and after visiting all three, Concrete Beach was my favorite.  There was a greater variety of styles of beer, and the sours & fruit beers were better and more flavorful."
Great dance and welcome ,September 2016,50,Miami City Ballet,Christophemiami,"Store open , area clean , people smiling."
You don’t have to love ballet to love Miami City Ballet ,June 2018,50,Miami City Ballet,Sanford6810,"I recently saw Miami City Ballet perform and it confirmed everything I’ve read about the company, and performances I’ve seen in the past of it and other companies. This is one of the great companies in the world. They dance the ballets of the great  choreographer Georges Balanchine better than any other company around as well more modern choreographers like Justin Peck. They possess energy, talent, wit and offer a fresh look at some of the great classics. If you are in Miami between October and March make sure you get tickets to see this company perform! If you’re not a ballet lover now, you’ll be one by the end of the evening."
Miami City Ballet's The Nutcracker,December 2017,50,Miami City Ballet,Annalisad65,"Miami City Ballet is one of our city’s greatest and most beloved treasures. In its more than 30 years, it has emerged to become one of the leading dance companies in the United States. Each and every performance by Miami City Ballet that I have attended, has been beautifully and flawlessly executed. Although I have enjoyed many of the ballets in its repertoire, I’m noting the production of George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker which they performed at the Ziff Ballet Opera House at The Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts this past December. As this was a new production with updated costumes and set designs by the famous team of Isabel and Ruben Toledo, I had secured front row seats where I could view the performance, the artistry, the costumes and the orchestra from my enviable vantage point. I hoped that the redesign would live up to the buzz that had surrounded it for months. Miami City Ballet didn’t disappoint, and the great reveal was worth the wait. As much as I loved the previous version, which I had seen several times, this new production was stellar, gorgeous and glorious. The costumes, which invoked the tropical colors of South Florida, featured intricate designs, updated silhouettes and moved beautifully on the dancers. Large new sets made for grandeur and fantasyland on the stage. Special effects enhanced the backdrop and made the opening snow scene and the soaring Christmas tree particularly enchanting and memorable. Most important, the dancers were effervescent, exuberant and a joy to watch. Even the program was special with whimsical and lovely illustrations by Ruben Toledo. My favorite scene: Arabian Coffee in her beautiful jewel-toned costume, her languid and sinuous movements combined spectacular jumps! The enthusiasm of the orchestra in unison with the artistry of the dancers made for a phenomenal and magical performance. Continued success and well-deserved applause Miami City Ballet!"

Lovely art museum on FIU Campus,January 2015,40,Frost Museum of Art,TouringLawyer,"With a combination of touring exhibits, a permant collection of art and some student shows, the Frost is a sophisticated art gallery on the campus of Florida International University. Admission is free and parking on campus is accessible. The Frost has a diverse collection and is definely worth a drive to the suburbs."
A minimal collection with good exhibits,September 2014,30,Frost Museum of Art,foxsmjr,"FIU's art museum is worth a trip in itself to take in their small permanent collection and constantly rotating exhibits of emerging artists.  It not big, easily managed in under an hour, and with free admission, there is no reason to miss it.  Worth the trip"
Cartografias del Agua (Maps of Water) by Rufina Santana,September 2015,40,Frost Museum of Art,canaryfrank,A beautiful building that showcases artists connected with the University.

Subpar customer service,December 2019,30,Miami City Ballet,carsoncita31,"I bought a $100 gift certificate for a hard-working paralegal who loves the ballet and wanted to take her daughters to see it. She lost the gift certificate and didn't tell me until much later. I contacted the MCB to ask about reissuing the gift certificate and learned that it was only valid for the 2018-2019 season, and so it was too late. I also asked about any kind of discount for future tickets in the event that they could not reissue the gift certificate which was clearly unused, and they offered NOTHING. Pretty disappointed in their customer service, and certainly will never purchase a gift certificate from them in the future."
Beautiful Church,April 2019,50,Gesu Catholic Church,bpask,Went to the service for Palm Sunday here but it was in Spanish.  There is a listing on the website about the offerings for the masses.
A beautiful and historic church.  A must visit for the faithful.,June 2019,50,Gesu Catholic Church,Maristar77,Gesu Catholic Church in the heart of downtown Miami is the oldest church in Miami. Mass is held weekday's at 12 Noon and it is a wonderful way to step into the past of old Miami and follow your faith.
This is historical and architectural jewel in downtown Miami,April 2019,50,Gesu Catholic Church,SergioR2013,"Many people coming to Miami just see the flashy things that tourists tend to visit ( most worth enjoying), but people might miss this historical and architectural jewel in downtown Miami. This a place of beauty and contemplation in the middle of all the activities. It has been beautifully restored under the Pastor Alvarez. There are relatively few great, preserved buildings in Miami, being so relatively young as a city. This is one of them. "
Amen,December 2018,50,Gesu Catholic Church,astrid m,"I'm so blessed that they never closed it, I first went back in 1988 and is one of the most original beautiful church left to see visit and admired"
Historic Church in the middle of downtown.,November 2019,40,Gesu Catholic Church,Stephen A,This old church is right in the midst of some older buildings downtown.

Trip to midtown,July 2018,40,Shops at Midtown Miami,3018trishab,"imagine my surprise at discovering this place. Being crew of a ship to find stores like Target, Marshall, etc in close proximity to one another and bigger than downtown Miami was a treat along with some interesting food stops. It was also pleasingly less crowded than downtown Miami."
Nice shopping centre,October 2018,40,Shops at Midtown Miami,chrisking8,This is a nice shopping centre that is very modern and clean with a very good selection of shops.  We particularly liked Target.  Lots of nice looking restaurants as well.
The Shops,May 2019,30,Shops at Midtown Miami,buddhakouri,"There is not much going on at Midtown shops except if you want to go to Target, Marshall's or Ross. There are other smaller shops to go to though. Home Goods is another place to go to or the Sporting Goods. But other than that, there's not a lot of interesting stores to go too. However it is good for those on a budget. There are some high-rise condos nearby, and there is a great public park nearby, two to be exact. Its close to Downtown and close to Miami Beach and Miami International Airport."

Great food and beer,October 2019,40,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Beanie14,"The highlight of our visit was the food from the food truck, absolutely delicious.  The beers were great too but the staff weren't friendly."
"A pleasant surprise for nationally owned ""local themed"" craft brewery",October 2019,40,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Scott W,"Stopped by last weekend and really enjoyed this place.   It definitely has a South American/Latin American vibe, not purely a Cuban vibe as many places in Miami.   The beers were all really good and reflected the flavors of the region.   Outstanding was the lulo (naranjilla) beer which was amazing.   We did the flights of 5 oz pours and they give you free samples of other beers if you ask.   Lots of other tropical flavors and all were very smoothly blended.   We sat at the bar and were there around 1 pm and the place began to fill up (inside and also outside patio) around 2.   They have numerous food specials (Peruvian and Argentine/Churrasco seem to be the main ones) but we didn't eat.   Parking is on the street pay by phone parking.   They also have a ""rewards"" club that earns you discounts pretty quickly.   Will definitely go back.   I was reticent to go here due to the AB InBev (Anhauser Busch) ownership but found it to be authentically local."
"Great atmosphere, beers, food",April 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Jim G,"Specializing in Brazilian style beers, my favorite at Veza Sur was Arroz Con Mango which is the first, and so far only, pepper beer I've ever liked."
Loved it great staff ,November 2019,50,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,Deedeewalsh,Great beer selection staff were lovely!!! Highly recommend! We were in Miami for 8 nights came here twice! Wynwood area in general is a great scene. Food cart is delicious too!
Brewery ,November 2019,40,Veza Sur Brewing Co.,LollysLook,Veza Sur Brewing co. In Wynwood was a good stop after visiting the walls. We got a table and sat at a couch outside. It was a nice area to rehab and try some ipo beers. One of our favorites was the caffe con flan—a coffee beer with sweet flan foam on top.

Need better hours but has lots of info,November 2018,30,LGBT Visitor Center Miami Beach,pspoker,"Well I am sure I'm not the first to say, they need to be open more hours. The first time we went they weren't open. But the 2nd time made it worth it as we got lots of info as to the local bars for LGBT. Also just good to know that something like this is here. You don't need to be gay to go in, they will have helpful info for you no matter who you are."
Helpful Center,November 2019,40,LGBT Visitor Center Miami Beach,Thomas V,The staff here were quite helpful and they have some good handouts.  Note the limited hours.  In a nice building in the center of town so easy to walk to.

Good way to commute,October 2019,40,Miami Metrorail,TravelDiaries_Pulkit,"I did not take the metro a lot but liked the fact that it is fast and clean. The only issue I had was the frequency, I guess it was 10 minutes between 2 trains."
Its Free....use it!,September 2019,50,Miami Metrorail,MRVEGAS711,"The MetroRail is something that should be used. Its free and while it doesn't cover all of downtown Miami, you can save a lot of walking by getting around with this system and saving the roads."
A great way to get around Miami.,November 2019,40,Miami Metrorail,hmsdos,"The rails are getting rather old, but pretty dependable.  The price is very reasonable and seats are generally available, timing generally reliable and great views when ""zipping"" through Miami-Dade.   The train is available for South, North and West exploration, including downtown Miami.   Also goes to the Miami International airport.   Overall very good. "
From Airport to Greyhound,June 2019,40,Miami Metrorail,Scott P,Miami's Metrorail as any other light rail transit system delivers speedy delivery of passengers to their destination whether it be to the downtown core or to the Greyhound or Amtrak terminals a few blocks away.

Fascinating but shocking history of Miami,May 2019,40,HistoryMiami,Debbie R,"One part that shocked me was the photographic exhibition on the first floor of the second building, a very graphic image of a human corpse with head and limbs cut off! This along with some other photographs make this section unsuitable for children."
Well Worth A Visit,February 2019,40,HistoryMiami,David A,"We were there for the Miami Pop Festival photo exhibit, which was interesting and well presented about the festival that paved the way for Woodstock."

Next door to the Public library and Metro mover.  Parking is easy as there is a garage attached to the building.  Great place to start to explore downtown. 
Just a true place of culture,October 2019,40,Domino Park,Alan H,"Very small, not much there, but it is a living piece of Cuban/American history.  See it, take a couple pictures, walk along the entire street, worth spending a couple hours on this street and eating along the way."
Interesting peek at old time Miami,October 2019,50,Domino Park,ElsieN99,Never a dull or quiet moment.  Enjoy watching as older cubans enjoy playing a game of dominos as they recount stories of days gone bye

Beautiful upscale shopping,November 2017,50,Shops at Merrick Park,G C,"A really beautiful upscale, 3-level outdoor mall with nice landscaping and water features.  A great place to spend a few hours.  I don't get the whole road going through the middle of the thing, it makes it awkward and not pedestrian friendly, but other than that it is amazingly well-done."

I was so impressed!,August 2019,50,Actors Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre,ChristineEsq,"I was here a few months ago to see 'Murder for Two' and I was beyond blown away by the quality of this two-man show.

Very Nice!,July 2019,40,Frost Museum of Art,kyanthetraveler,"I recommend it to everyone, and it’s definitely a MUST when you visit Miami"
Good time with family,August 2019,50,Frost Museum of Art,WilbertDJS,Great place to visit with kids. Lots of interactive art and very educational for young kids (and adults well). The planetarium at this place was amazing and was worth experience.
Intimate art museum,September 2019,40,Frost Museum of Art,Mktpro99,Nice art museum that you can see in about 1 hour. Terrific exhibitions on LBGTQ art as well as photos of old Miami Beach. Very pleasant receptionist. FREE.
LBGT art (at the moment),November 2019,40,Frost Museum of Art,scott r,"Enjoyed the experience, and the fact that someone curated an exhibit basically of and by (though not necessarily 'for', anyone can benefit from a view) the community.  Striking architectural space.  Make certain you want to see what's exhibited at the moment - interior photos posted here were not the collection presently on view.  Parking is hard to figure out - there is a paid lot with visitor spots, but getting into it is not (!) intuitive.  Sadly the desk clerk did not bother to explain that there's a lot more to see on site than just the art museum itself, and I left without realizing that - bummer, and a little annoying in retrospect / but I had other stops that day, so OK."
Lots of great stores ,March 2017,40,Shops at Merrick Park,michaelbeetoronto,"A few restaurants, but not many.  Lots if name brand department stores. Beautiful outdoor mall.  Worth visiting. "

Pleasant Alternative to the Mall,May 2017,40,Shops at Merrick Park,Travelspirit,"Merrick Park is a beautiful place to visit.  Whether shopping, dining, or relaxing - there is something to keep everyone happy. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously maintained.  There's room to sprawl out on the lawn and play with the kids, or sit in the shade and enjoy a treat from one of the vendors during the weekend pop up farmer's market. Will definitely be back."
Good shopping ,July 2017,40,Shops at Merrick Park,chapa7113,It's has good shopping with variety of stores. The food and restaurants I am not a fan off. The parking is always easy 
Free admission and  interesting art exhibit!,July 2019,40,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",WencyB,We went there an hour before they close so not many people were there. I find the art exhibits interesting and some quite familiar. 
Great place. Free.,September 2019,50,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",Melby7,"Great place. Free. Several different small exhibitions. Some very interesting, some less so, depending on your tastes. But you can easily spend a hour there."
Delightful Saturday Afternoon,August 2019,50,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",josephwert,"We decided to spend Saturday in the Wynwood and the Design District and included the Institute of Contemporary Art in our visit.  What a terrific adventure to see so many thoughtfully and artfully curated exhibits! The museum space itself in very impressive, and an ""easy on your feet""  environment ... a much more enjoyable experience than the Perez! Great place to include on any itinerary to Miami!"
Would it go back,October 2019,30,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",S8D3T,"I have been to many art galleries previously but this one was particularly stark, the staff were very uninterested and made you feel very uncomfortable. "
"Great space, not so great exhibits (when I visited)",November 2019,30,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",scott r,"I assume this review is conditional - depending on what's showing you may enjoy this much more.  Unbfortunately when I came the artists showing were mostly the worst sort of contemporary:  ""here is my concept of cultural pain, as told through used building supplies and paper products""  ""This empty plastic bottle signifies the ecnomic and environmental degredation to which we are all forced to submit by"" … whom exactly.  And really, haven't we seen the colored neon tubes before?  Galleries are still displaying this?  Might have been the day, might have been the indifferent staff, might have been the scowling security who float through looking both bored and vaguely hostile....  However, all of this is FREE, the building itself is worth seeing (from an interior perspective it really is good ), you're next door to the de la Cruz which is much better and landed in the design district which itself is worth a wander - so it's all good in the end."
Sunny Shopping & Dining @ Merrick Park,October 2016,50,Shops at Merrick Park,KriticL,All the brands you want with great dining options are gathered in this 3 story 'private' and intimate outdoor shopping mall in Coral Gables. Ample parking. $$$

Miami Shopping Tour,December 2016,50,Shops at Merrick Park,DAIsidron,"This is a wonderful outdoor, high-end mall with premium stores.  Lovely to spend the afternoon strolling in a cool day in Miami.  Outdoor cafes and restaurants offer a variety of options for dining; however, we were unable to decide on one.  We shopped at Victoria's Secret, Sephora, & Vineyard Vines.  There were no crowds or lines anywhere and we found parking to be easy.  Great experience.   We will be visit again. "
"Beautiful, outdoor shopping and dining!",December 2016,50,Shops at Merrick Park,mari15Miami,Great shops and great food in a beautiful outdoor setting. In beautiful Coral Gables! Spend a few hours or spend a day. High end movie theater with food and drinks is the perfect ending to a day of shopping and dining!
Shops at Merrick Park,October 2016,40,Shops at Merrick Park,NChardon1,"The Shops at Merrick Park is another beautiful open mall in Miami / Coral Gables area. It is a more high-end place. Centrally located, nice open space environment. You must pay for parking. Some good restaurants there as well. "
Nice visit,December 2018,40,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",PetriKoo,If you are heading to Design District - visit ICA as well. Museum is fully free - it isn't very big but their parking garage is worth the visit just by itself.
A profound Art experience ,December 2018,50,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",cwbyesq,This museum is located in an eclectic neighborhood which is worth visiting. There is no fee for this special experience. I suggest taking the 45 minute tour unless you are familiar with the artists. The excellent guide enabled me to appreciate the art and the artists. Some of the art was experiential. I found the experience to be profound.
Miami Art Scene's newest museum,December 2018,50,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",Mark G,"Free admission for the public, Norman Braman's gift to the community. A first quality new museum  with a fine collection and excellent contemporary artist shows.Next door is the de la Cruz Collection of Latin American Art. Best of all you can wander around the new Design District, with it's dozens of all new and architecturally wonderful designer stores, with art and sculpture all around. There are tours and guide books available for the neighborhood. A recent Miami redone neighborhood, well worth a visit. Near Wynwood also."
Disappointed,January 2019,30,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",rschagrin,They have a very nice sculpture garden without much sculptures. The museum is 3 floors with spare exhibits and those are bazaar.
Not impressed,July 2019,20,Hyde Beach,marcocE9236ZD,The party itself is not that bad. But if you are travelling alone and decide to get in you won't have a nice experience. You will have to spend 100$ at the bar minimum which is okay but if you don't have a reserved table there's no way to leave your bags anywhere and you have no sunbeds or a table to seat. It's probably a place for rich people so if you are just a regular person and want to have some fun I suggest you to stay away. They don't offer good option for people travelling solo. And if they offer any options they didn't tell me about them because probably they thought I wasn't rich enough to afford a table by myself.
Shopping in style!,May 2016,40,Shops at Merrick Park,Trioletos,And parking is on site and not expensive!

Expensive!,July 2016,40,Shops at Merrick Park,Diane L,Nice but really? If you're bored it's nice. 2 hour parking is 3 bucks unless you buy something  and get it stamped.  Loads of shops outside. Big name shops and small ones. 3 levels.    
Amazing new space!,January 2018,50,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",147rjd,We went today and love it! It’s really amazing! Great space and great works! Very happy to be there today!
Great!!,January 2018,50,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",mauriciot611,"Located on the renovated area of miami (design district), a great building with a lovely garden, with a really challenging exhibition of true contemporary art.. deserves a visit, really really worthy it. "
"Beautiful space, interesting exhibit",February 2018,40,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",3GMB,"Our friends introduced us to the ICA about 2 weeks ago.  We were so impressed that we just took visiting family there.  As mentioned, there is no entrance fee.  The outdoor garden gallery is lovely and is a great way to begin.  We then proceeded to the top (third) floor and worked our way down.  We thoroughly enjoyed the current exhibit, The Everywhere Studio.  The gallery space itself is beautiful and is a great addition to the Miami Design District and the Miami art scene. "
My timing was off,March 2018,40,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",zarielcreative,"My visit coincided with major construction outside and a change in exhibits so I was only able to visit the ground floor and wasn’t able to fully appreciate the outside artwork to its fullest. I loved that it was free to enter the ICA and found the staff incredibly knowledgeable and friendly (because I wasn’t familiar with the artists). After going through the gallery, I really loved the Felix Gonzales-Torres work. It was so cool to interact with a piece of work that asked you to take a printed poster away with you! That was pretty amazing - especially when the De La Cruz Collection next door had another installation piece that asked you to take candy!!! Worth a pop in!"

Santa's isn't the only attraction here.,August 2018,40,Tropical Park,L8604CFdanielar,"Right off the Palmetto, at the entrance of Westchester, lies Tropical Park. It has a bit of everything and really comes in clutch for those who love to exercise outside and for free! The parking here is free and there are plenty of different spots in the park where you could workout with friends or host a BBQ or a birthday party. My childhood was filled with some dope outdoor birthday parties at Tropical Park. They have the huts you can use with a charcoal grill and picnic tables...just beware of raccoons. There truly so much you can do here and I suggest entering a different way each time, whether through the main entrance on Bird Road or on Miller or any side streets that lead into the park. It will always give you a new perspective."
Huge park in South Miami with local floras,October 2017,50,Tropical Park,Liliana N,"This park has a wide variety of sport areas including baseball , soccer, boating , bysicling, lots of picnick tables with adjacent bbq grills around the lakes and spread throughout the park.

History but no freedom,January 2019,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Lilian D," This used to be the tallest building in Miami many decades ago and it was empty for many years. When the cuban boat lift ,in the 60s, the building was used to process all Cubans that were arriving escaping from Castro’s communism. It is now a museum donated to Miami Dade College by a group of cuban business men. The 1st floor is dedicated to the cuban migration. Very interesting but incomplete, as it only shows the beginning of the cuban struggle for freedom. "
America's generosity,February 2019,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,dotcho,A good explanation of how America reached out to the Cubans who were oppressed under the Castro regime.  Interesting photos and feedback from that time.  Separate historical exhibition of times long ago with many artefacts and documents.
Great architecture,March 2019,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,NewOrleansfirstgal,This building is so unique and it really stands out in downtown Miami.  There is a museum in it but we didn't have the time to visit.  I am sure the history of the Cuban arrivals is very interesting.
Intimate art space,May 2016,40,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",Miamismith305,"This space located in the Design District is dedicated to contemporary artists. It is a small space, but it serves as a platform for new and established artists from Miami and the world. Great place to spend time alone, immerse yourself in the art world and best of all it is free."
Lovely contemporary art space,October 2016,40,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",daniel_dinzi,"Free entry! The lady at the front desk was very helpful, providing not only information on the exhibits but other recommended places to visit in the district. When I went they had four exhibits, the Susan King exhibit was my favorite."
Little disappointing ,March 2019,30,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Jadetb,"Attended here on a Wednesday, only opens at 1pm, $12 entrance fee for an adult. Pretty building with a large part to play in the Cuban culture & history in Miami, unfortunately I feel as though it was lacking in this area, I feel as though there is more money spent on the art installations and shows. I wanted to learn and see more with regards to the Cuban history. "
Buildiing with 9 Lives or at least Several,April 2019,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Greatswag,"This building started life as the Federal Customs House due to Miami's position as one of the main ports in the Southeast. It was used during the 1950's and 1960's as a backdrop for the Florida East Coast Railroads streamline passenger trains from the Northeast and Midwest, although not the actual Miami train station. Now this beautiful Beaux Arts tower has a new life as a Miami museum and exhibition hall with its new name, The Freedom Tower! "
Just a Bunch of Expensive Restuarants,February 2019,30,Coconut Grove,BigSkyTripper,"We stayed in the area for too long... 10 days.  Nothing special to do there except spend money in overpriced, crowded restaurants. Vizcaya Museum and Gardens was the highlight for  me. Found things to outside Coconut Grove in close proximity."
KILLING TIME ON THE MIRACLE MILE,January 2019,30,Miracle Mile,Rumplestiltskinned,In was a cold (48 degrees) in January and very windy.  I walked the length and saw a huge variety of shops and people. I liked the walk up Starbucks with the ordering window open to the street.  I believe this is the oldest (1924) Miracle Mile in the country.  It has the best restaurants of any such shopping area in the country.  A great place to see beautiful women (but South Beach is better) and to sit and people watch without buying a thing.  The shops and restaurants are uniformly expensive.  I do think they could use a little more updating.
"Lovely place to shop, eat, drink and people watch",January 2019,50,Miracle Mile,sge31,"One of the first 'Miracle Mile's in the States this area is full of shops, restaurants bars and cafe's, all branching off Coral Way. There is plenty of parking available, I parked behind California Pizza Kitchen off Salzado Street where there is a two floor parking lot. Many places to recommend here but I enjoyed John Martins Irish pub (expensive beer though!), Tap 42 at Salzedo and Giralda, and Seasons 52 on Coral Way. Definitely a nice place to spend a few hours."
One of Miami's prettiest and most visited parks,October 2017,40,Tropical Park,rvmiami,"Tropical park has been a place for family fun and sports for as long as I can remember. Thankfully the park has been well maintained and offers everything from places to picnic, sports, equestrian activities and more. A local park open for everyone."
Huge park!!,January 2018,40,Tropical Park,lalocadr19,"Running park, this park has it, running track, bench, trails, horses, bike rental, pavilion rental, tables first come first serve. No fee to enter."
Relaxing,February 2018,50,Tropical Park,BigWash,I came here just to read the paper and eat lunch!  The park is clean and safe!  I even played a little Pokémon go!
Not good anymore,December 2017,10,Tropical Park,Maritza C,"To many homeless living there and the pee and poop in front of you no matter what and the police can't do anything about it unless you take pictures of it happening..  Had to cancel our Christmas party there because of this.  When my kids were young we would go every Saturday and have picnics, rent bikes and paddle boats but now no way.  Went with the grand kids to check out the shelter that we rented for the party and this guy just pulled it out and pissed in front of us, the place stunk or urine and poop.  The administrator was very apologetic but we cancelled and went elsewhere.  Some of these people are sexual predators that have no where to go but they should not be in a park."
Great if you can avoid the idiot rangers,May 2017,20,Tropical Park,Don F,"Was hassled by some uneducated park ranger about having a camera on a tripod. ""Yoo filmin' you need a permanent"".  Doesn't even know or pronounce the word 'permit' but is somehow in charge of my leisure time and activities. Only COMMERCIAL photography needs a permit, you know...equipment trailers...dollies...a group of actors or producers. Still the only word that sticks with these morons is 'photography'. I believe if she carried it any further it'd be a violation of my rights, so I recommend if you're approached to turn on your video and tape it and remain completely silent until they either escalate it or go away.  I remained silent and she vanished. There are some who will try to escalate it, as when I was assaulted on the public sidewalk at Watson Island by another low IQ guard. Stay cool, silent and get it all on tape! In case they call a cop you might want to use ACLU Blue so they can't snatch your phone and erase it."
So many wedding dress shops !,February 2019,30,Miracle Mile,Caroline W,We found several nice places to eat near our hotel (Colonnade) but Miracle Mile is nothing special really
Tuna Tartare was fresh and direct from the sea!!!,March 2019,50,Miracle Mile,carlosaP9438EH,Ortanique on the Mile is a unique delicious gourmet dining experience. Cindy Hudson the award winning chef  creativity is in every plate on menu...It's creation of the Tuna Tartare is an absolute delight...as always  the  service is excellent.
A street,March 2019,20,Miracle Mile,peterpiperpickedapec,"A long street with shops, bars, cafes, wide pavements, noisy cars, and a euphemistic name. Best avoided if you ask me."
Like his name say it,June 2018,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Naovice,"Freedom tour is one of the symbol of Miami may visit it if someone  is interested on history, easy to get there."
It would have been nice if their website had been updated to let you know there is a Fee.,October 2018,20,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,travel_agentAtlanta,"The outside of the building and the Lobby are spectacular!  You know the building is historic.  But, that's as far as we got.  The literature and info on the web says it's free to tour.....but it's not. So we wound up not going inside to tour.  The night of our bus tour , the building was illuminated by red light.   It is a different color every night....it's some sort of ""secret"" what color it will be each night.  I am rating it 2, because they should let tourists know in advance there is a fee  to tour the building, because all their stuff, including their pamphlet says it's free."
History Reminder!,November 2018,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Cottonelle,This is Miami's Pier 21... It was the go to place for Cuban refugees and it was a beacon of hope and freedom. We did not go inside.

Interesting history,November 2018,30,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,207arnew,Standing in the large hall and imagin it filled with newspaper workers was fascinating. 
Would be perfect if they ever complete the construction ,January 2018,40,Miracle Mile,lifecameraadventure,We have stayed in the area a few times over the past few years and the sidewalk has been under construction every time.  Otherwise it has lots of great shops and restaurants and even with the construction it is easy to walk the area.

Big outdoor location in the middle of residential area,March 2017,40,Tropical Park,Osgales,Big park where you can practice a variety of outdoor activities.

Oasis in Miami,March 2017,30,Tropical Park,celainej1,"On my most recent visit to Tropical Park I decided to do a review because I was both pleased and disappointed. The park is located in a fairly central part of Miami so access is pretty easy. Right off main roads and SR 826 it's no trouble getting there. First the good. You can jog, fish, go boating, play tennis, basketball, have picnics, just about anything you'd like. It's free to use so that's another good thing. There's also a snack bar with a really helpful and friendly staff. Now the bad. On this particular day I noticed tons of garbage where it didn't belong, as in a garbage can. The trash was lying next to the cans and nobody bothered to pick it up. At the basketball courts you had lots of young people playing and screaming every obscenity you can imagine. There were park employees right there and no one said a word to try and stop it. I'm certain that type of language isn't acceptable in any public park. Its still a nice place in the middle of a huge city but the employees should pay attention to the little things. "
Afternoon Stroll ,December 2018,40,Miracle Mile,nibaldom2015,"Miracle Mile is in the area of Coral Gables, and it’s the Main Street to walk and see lots of restaurants as well as some boutiques. You get a variety of different establishments, and with the changes made to the mile it is much more pedestrian friendly. Great place to come with the family and spend the afternoon walking around and enjoy the South Florida weather. Enjoy"
Holidays!,December 2018,40,Miracle Mile,April B,"So much to see and do on Miracle Mile aka Coral Way in Coral Gables. From restaurants, to gadget shops and wedding dress shopping to top salons and outdoor furniture Kettal to the US Post Office and everyone goes to Barnes and Noble. Try Hillstone for dinner and California Pizza for lunch! Great place to people watch. You can usually park behind Barnes and Noble and get your ticket stamped in B&N or park in the city lots around or get the pay by phone app and locate a spot on the side streets."
Nice area to walk around and shop or eat,December 2018,50,Miracle Mile,hectorfrommiami,"Stores, cafeterias, art galleries, restaurants, bars, parks, nice views.  For about 5 blocks with the streets that run across each one of them there is plenty to see and enjoy here.  From smoothies to alcoholic drinks, from a burger or a spanish style empanada to a serious meal, be it Thai, Japanese, Mexican, Mediterranean, American, and more, there is a lot offering here. Once a month there is a fest when art galleries open their displays of masterpieces and offer wine and cheese to visitors.  During the end of year Holidays it is an area not to be missed."

Disappointing ,July 2018,20,Miracle Mile,debmink,"We were so excited to go to Miracle Mile on our last trip to Miami. We lived in the area several years ago and this used to be one of them most exciting places to visit. Now, there are many bridal boutiques and restaurants. There are a couple of bookstores but nothing special. I would rather go to the beach or even to one of the many malls if I’m going to shop. Miracle mile seems to be a “has been”in place. How sad. "
Nice for an evening stroll,August 2018,40,Miracle Mile,sazzamarr,"Lots of interesting shops, bars and restaurants. Spanish/Mediterranean influence is evident in terms of the buildings and food and drink. We especially loved the ‘umbrella walkway’ just off the miracle mile."

There are lots of places to picnic, especially near one of the lakes they have in the park. It's also a great place to ride a bike (you can also rent family size bikes). A favorite is the hill where you'll find people flying kites, riding bikes, or just rolling down the hill."
Relaxing in the nature,December 2015,50,Tropical Park,Heidi O,"This is more than just a park.  You can play sports, basketball, tennis, etc here, or you can take a long leisure cycle ride with your bicycle as the park is huge!!

Very nice park!,June 2016,40,Tropical Park,Maria O,"Tropical Park is one of the few parks in Miami.  It is big and has lots of shelters where families gather to celebrate parties -- mostly birthday parties.  There is also an equestrian center as well as a few soccer and baseball fields AND a dog's park.  I believe that they now have the food trucks once a month as well as free concerts.  I truly enjoy walking the perimeter of the park which takes about 1 hour (walking at about 15 mins. per mile).  All and all Tropical Park is a very nice place to visit with family, friends including those friends with four legs!  "
Must visit for events,December 2015,50,Tropical Park,Jenna H,I have been here several times for Santa's Enchanted Forest and it is huge. Always fun and very inexpensive.

Always something going on here.  Nice green space in a very busy area.   I have also seen picnic tables/shelters for family events.

The architecture is stunning, it's legacy and now the incorporation of art has added so much flavor to this iconic location. "
"Iconic building, not much to see",March 2017,30,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,SerendipityIndia,"Freedom tower is visible from a distance once you are in the area of Biscayne. Situated near AA arena, we saw this often as we were staying in the area. It symbolizes the history of Miami immigrants and served as a great landmark when we were walking in the area. However, like some of the other towers in US, there is not much to do here."
Neat area but don’t plan a day out of it,June 2018,30,Miracle Mile,Brandy_N1975,"A lot of high end shops, mostly bridal. On the flip side, the restaurant choices were plentiful.

The Closest to Nature for Westchester,January 2016,50,Tropical Park,Mel_Medd,"There is so much to say about this little gem.  THough many may say this isn't the best park, this is the ONLY big, open space of land and nature we have around our area. With 275-acres of land, this park is almost always filled with kids, adults and teenagers. There is lots to do: you can lounge by the lake, walk, run or bike on the trails, take your kids out to play - tennis, baseball, soccer, football, and basketball. You can rent double or 4 seater bikes, enjoy the view of the sunset falling behind the trees, take your kids out to play at the playground, and there is plenty of space for hangouts and BBQ. There is a fairly big hill to stand on top of so you can overlook the park which is pretty neat. They have fit camps, and workout sessions. You can throw parties and have bounce houses and there is also a dog park.  There really is a lot to do for just about anyone. And how can I forget to mention the famous Santas Enchanted Forest! I have been coming to this park since I was old enough to walk, and it has never failed me.  It is a great place, good atmosphere, and there is always something to do, even if that means snapping some pics of the sunset.  It really is a gorgeous park."
"Beautiful, Safe Park",February 2016,50,Tropical Park,BGoudieSOMI,I love Tropical Park. It is great to exercise in (run up the hill a few times) or to simply relax. There are many sports venues and a great dog park.

It's also a very inexpensive park."
Oasis in the middle of the city,September 2015,50,Tropical Park,Miris S,Tropical Park is a relaxing spot in the hustle of the city. Locals have birthday parties and picnics in the park. It the perfect set for such occasions with lakes and rolling hills. Its a must see when in Miami.

Waltzing on the mile,February 2018,50,Miracle Mile,Victoria H,I love the specials and shops. Perfect combination of dining and shopping with almost all types of food and dessert places. Even beauty parlors and my favorite wedding shops...they are beautifying so traffic can get crazy during construction times... but the variety is worth it if you walk from a garage. Many garages... for cheap parking.

A park instiution,June 2015,40,Tropical Park,cazu247,We have been going to tropical park since we were kids.  It is a nostalgic place for us since my parents and family celebrate all our outdoor festivities there.  It is still a great family park.
Not what it was 10 yrs ago,April 2018,10,Coconut Grove,Watsondg,We returned expecting coco walk to be the nightlife happening spot it was 10 yrs ago and was very disappointed. Shops boarded up only a few restaurants left Cheesecake Factory gone. No longer worth the drive from South Beach.The Green St cafe was great though.
Don’t bother,May 2018,10,Coconut Grove,432deboraha,Having read about the tree lined streets and lovely boutiques and eateries my sister and I were looking forward to escaping the tacky vibe of south beach and spent good money on an Uber to get to Coconut Grove. Breakfast was ok but rather spoiled by the endless stream of construction traffic. The few retail units that were occupied seemed unable to grasp the concept of actually opening their doors - they were supposed to open at 11am and by 11:20am most were still closed. Coconut Grove does not have any vibe at all. Waste of time. Don’t bother.
Family oriented great area!,June 2017,50,Coconut Grove,coachmanel,"I love this area, it has many green spaces, low buildings filled with families and local business. It is a Nice area and there are restaurants and one shopping center which is currently under renovation (Coco Walk shops). Totally relaxing neighborhood with some good hotels and plenty of Airb&b offers to stay well located."
Great shopping!,April 2018,50,Coconut Grove,coolmom50,Must see when visiting Miami. Great shopping and restaurants.Great for strolling around in the evening.
Just another marina,January 2018,30,Coconut Grove,Peter L,"We went there in Jan this year.  Since it was off season and during the week, there were not much to do in the area.  However, it was a nice quiet place to walk around and see different sailing boats..  There was a nice eatery in the area.  The food was reasonable priced and tasty.  "

A lot of hype but good for a stroll,December 2017,40,Miracle Mile,MooresRoad,Nice shops and building decor. Nothing much else to do. The Coral Gables Museum is a place to spend about half to one hour. 
Nice change of pace. ,December 2017,50,Miracle Mile,Pineapples-a-Plenty,"The family enjoyed the walk up and down the boulevard. There is a massive project that is almost complete to upgrade the street and sidewalks. Very pleasant!  Nice shops, and excellent restaurants.

Large open park with beautiful lakes,July 2013,40,Tropical Park,yreyes216,"I love all parks, but this one is on the top list. It offers so much space for any outdoor event you wish to do. Running, riding bicycle with the family, picnic areas, fishing, even boat padding. The only negative is you can't swim in the lakes. Other than that, it is a nice place to spend the afternoon. And if you don't want to jump off the grind, it offers free wifi too."
Very nice park,May 2013,50,Tropical Park,jrlastres,"This park is free there is a lot to do, play with the kids football. But take water you'll need it. Again only bad thing is how hot it is there."

Splendid for outdoor activities,July 2014,50,Tropical Park,lidyh,"This is an amazing park to have meetings and parties with family and/or friends. We enjoy every time we visited it with large group of friends. You will always find a spot. You can run freely and deeply breathe and you will feel mind free, nature activities are always better than indoors. Actually I think this should be a must for every family because this is a way to put us in contact with healthy activities. Highly recommended!"
nice views,February 2018,50,Coconut Grove,73glennk,"sailboats, yachts, view of downtown, and gorgeous water. This is worth a couple of hours of serenity "
Too much construction,February 2018,20,Coconut Grove,Suzanne S,"We went around the art festival. That was the highlight of the area. Everything else was covered by scaffolding. Couldn't take pictures. Did see a few nice places to eat, but everything was packed. Parking was expensive if you don't get a meter."
One of the Best Kept secrets in Miami,January 2018,50,Coconut Grove,CocoGroveMike,Coconut Grove is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Miami.    It has great bayfront water views of Dinner Key and Biscayne Bay.    The Grove has become the best Foodie location in Miami.
Love this town,February 2018,50,Coconut Grove,TLVento,"Since moving here, CG has been one of my favorite places to go. I love all the restaurants and the small town feel. It will be even nicer with all the improvements they are making. Be sure to go to the annual art festival in February. It's not to be missed."
Empty neighborhoods ,March 2018,20,Coconut Grove,Melanie_do,"We went there to see the neighborhood and do some shopping, but it was really empty and all shops are closed due to some heavy construction works. "

There is a grand festival usually the first weekend in March called Carnival on the Mile with stages filled with all kinds of music , food stands and pure fun."
Under Construction,July 2017,40,Miracle Mile,scoutdreams,The city is doing a major improvement on the Miracle Mile so it was a little tough getting around. We were there late on a Sunday so there wasn't much pedestrian traffic and a lot of the shops were closed.  We were more restaurant shopping along the mile than merchandise shopping at that time. 
Great Park,August 2012,50,Tropical Park,ohiotravelerer,"It was so nice to find such a large green space in the busy city!  This park has so much to offer - soccer, baseball, tennis, boxing, lakes, exercise trails, paddleboats and so much more.

great park,March 2012,30,Tropical Park,lalocadr19,"Clean park, this park is huge. baseball , soccer area. I like the hill which you can run up and down."
This place is for the dogs!,December 2012,40,Tropical Park,Troy G,"If the gate was operational and if the park was opened at the time it was posted to be open, this would have received an Excellent rating from me and my 8 year old."
Just a bunch of playing fields surrounding a couple of ponds,November 2012,20,Tropical Park,Cricket A,"I am a local resident and only visit when a league game is played there, or a private party is scheduled there.  If you're looking for recreational areas, there are a lot nicer places to visit in Miami.  How about Pinecrest Botanical Gardens, Fairchild Botanical Gardens, Deering Estate?( All within 20 minutes of Tropical Park)"
Quiet place to stay if you want to be away from the city,December 2017,30,Coconut Grove,NatSteveC,"I liked Coconut Grove because it was quiet but still had enough bars, boutique shops and restaurants.  It is a close drive to Miami Beach and Downtown.  It was decorated lovely for Christmas and felt like a safe place to walk around at night.  We stayed in the Mayfair Hotel, so we were right in the heart of the Grove.  The Cocowalk Mall is a strange place, with most of the shops closed down, not sure what is happening there, but the cinema is still open.  However, it's great for parking here and reasonable if you visit the Grove."
Nothing much,December 2017,20,Coconut Grove,Tuan S,We had lots of expectation when we went to this place but there was hardly aything to see. It was deserted and most of the shops were closed in the evening. We are not what are the attractions in this place. Waste of time. 
Upscale Construction,January 2018,20,Coconut Grove,runaway2travel,"It is an upscale area for those looking for a change from SOBE, but there really is nothing here honestly. You can drive through on Main St and say you had done it as you head on to your next adventure."
Fun little place to visit,December 2017,40,Coconut Grove,Bobbie U,We showed up there on a random day out and did not have a specific destination in the area. We found some fun little shops and walked around for about an hour taking in the sites. 
AETHETIC PLEASING,January 2018,50,Coconut Grove,jessofmed,"The coolest, highly classy vibe of MIAMI. Highly recommend checking it out. It also has a variety selection of asian cuisine which I always need. Very nice buildings give off a NYC vibe. "
The Best City Park,December 2012,50,Tropical Park,stareyes13,"I visit Tropical park various times a month.  They have so many activities from sports leagues (softball, baseball, football, soccer kickball) to agriculture and cattle shows.  They also have tennis, basketball, and raquetball courts.  Every December they host Santa's Enchanted Forest a Holiday amusement park.  This park is an amazing place to discover, with walking and biking trails to playgrounds for kids.  They even have Geocaches hidden throughout the park, which are treasures that are found using GPS.  Take a day, pack a picnic and share this place with your family."
Part of Miami Dade College now...,July 2015,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Sid K,The building is part of the ever expanding Miami Dade college now. If you are visiting Miami and want to check it out get on the Metro-mover and take the Omni loop [the guard at government center will direct you to the proper mover]. The mover is free. Get off at the Freedom Tower stop. Often [not ever week] there is an exhibit in the building. Just go through the doors and ask the person inside. Tell them you are visiting the area. If there is something worth seeing they will let you know. If there is no one sitting at the desk just wander around. No one will get upset.
"A quieter place to walk, dine or shop",June 2017,50,Miracle Mile,Carlos N,This place is quieter than Miami Beach's boulevards. Lots of restaurant's of every price level. I recommend Hillston and Le Provenval. The Merrick Village Mall is near by. There is a theater on the mile and a independent movie. Plenty things to do. Happy hours on Thursday and Friday are great.
Shopping and restaurants ,June 2017,40,Miracle Mile,1817MaryannS,Nice place to still and have a meal. This is a upscale street. You can tell they are trying to make it the go to shopping place. It's not quite there for people out of the area that are use to upscale but maybe if you are from an area that doesn't have this type of area it might be worth it. Parking can be tricky. Just keep driving.  
Not pleasant,June 2017,30,Miracle Mile,Diane A,"generally a good place for restaurants and shops, coral gables has been constructing a more pedestrian friendly coral way and the construciton is horrible for traffic, foot and vehicular.  stay away for another 5 months or so. then, it should be fabulous"
pleasant street,December 2016,40,Miracle Mile,madiestan,"pleasant street to walk around, plenty of shops albetr mainly wedding attire, lots of restaurants too"
Avoid it!!!,June 2017,10,Miracle Mile,FAM1955,"Miracle Mile has been remodeled since several months ago, and they are not close to finish it!! It takes forever to drive through, so avoid it (use other streets to get to Douglas Road, go to the crossing with Coral Way and cross to it. The construction ends at the end of Miracle Mile."
Rather Small Exhibit of the Cuban Refugee Story,May 2016,30,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,AreWeHavingFunYet,"The Freedom Tower is the only older style architecture in the area, and for that reason, it's worth a visit.  Inside there is a small photo exhibit of the Cuban exiles in the 1960s, specially the children who arrived alone in the US via the Pedro Pan effort.  The exhibit is free.  There is paid parking lot behind the Freedom Tower on the next block."
Cuban Icon in Miami,April 2016,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Darnel-HDI,"This tower is located in down town Miami.  I did not enter inside, but the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour Guide tell us about this building. It was used as processing center for incoming Cuban in 1960's. The tower looks unique among high rise building in the area."
Building was made for pictures,May 2016,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Grover R,"I recently was in Miami and whether eating at downtown restaurants or driving through downtown, this building provide great views.  It was made for pictures as well.  I wish we had had time to visit but even just the exterior is great to see."
History I was not aware of,May 2016,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Nirmal S,I was not aware of Cuban children airlift and part Freedom tower played in it. Photos as well as artefacts are beautifully displayed in various halls. It is a place one has to visit to learn about the humanitarian mission played by USA. 
"Used to be very interesting, not as much, only toursit restaurants mostly, and some stores",November 2017,30,Coconut Grove,lolinstar,If you like touristic restaurants this is the place....and some boutique stores.... It used to have many more.... Parking is pay by phone mostly...
Gorgeous Florida historical village by the sea! Free Coconut Grove Trolley.,November 2017,50,Coconut Grove,mclay2015,"Hop on the free Coconut Grove trolley and have lunch in the village in one of the oldest neighborhoods of Miami. Super charming, lots of restaurants and a marina to explore."
Great little town on the water just south of Miami,November 2017,50,Coconut Grove,HBeachTraveler,"Since our grown children live in the area, this is a great little place to go out to dinner or breakfast.  The downtown is fairly small, but since it sits on the water, it's a really nice place to visit.  You can also head south on Old Cutler Road to see the large homes in the area.  And it has a long and tree covered bike lane that goes on for miles.  "
Gorgeous shopping and dining with historic areas,October 2017,40,Coconut Grove,Candy_Florida_Girl,"Gorgeous area to wander and shop and dine! Small downtown area where other shops and tiny coffee houses and tea spots. Parking is around the streets or in the garage nearby; lots to see and do, wear comfy shoes and have a cocktail outside, dine al fresco and shop and people watch."
Nice spot for overnight,December 2017,40,Coconut Grove,Patrick E,"We had just one night in Miami before a cruise, and picked the Sonesta hotel on the edge of Coconut Grove. Fun neighborhood for an evening stroll, outdoor music  and a couple of good breakfast spots. Strolled through the Barnacle after breakfast, nice little historic park."
Great spot to shop and dine ,August 2017,50,Miracle Mile,995amandac,"Miracle mile is great to explore/ many places to dine, whether for a quick coffee or a three course meal. It's easy to get around and there's lots of parking."
Freedom Tower - Miami,February 2016,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Juanfane,Make sure to check them out as they are always hosting new exhibits.
An iconic Miami landmark which was once the highest landmark of the city,April 2016,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,talentpicker,"Of historical importance and an iconic landmark in downtown Miami,over the last decade or more it has been dwarfed by high rise hotels and condominiums.its persona has changed as much as the exterior colors and remains a much photographed building,worth a closer look."

Great building and museum,September 2015,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,oranhese,"Historical building in the city of Miami, very beautiful and with a lot of character. Inside the building there is a museum in which you can learn a lot about the Cuban immigration"
After 46 years ,July 2016,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Brainchick1,"Words cannot express the emotion I felt walking in through these doors after 46 years .. The Freedom Tower which is now part of Miami Dade college was once the refugee center for Cuban exiles .. On July 7th , 1970 my family and I who just arrived from Cuba were taken here to process into the United States . As a seven year old girl I was frightened and lost and these amazing people made it all wonderful for us until our families came for us three days later . I will forever be grateful for the beautiful white patterned leather shoes I received .. Going I there with my best friend who was also celebrating her anniversary as well was the best .. "
"NOISY. CONGESTED. TERRIBLE AMBIANCE. CARS ALWAYS RIDING THEIR HORNS, RUNNING RED LIGHTS. BEEPING AT PEDESTRIANS. AWFUL",January 2018,20,Miracle Mile,JimKev65,Peace.
Good to visit,August 2016,30,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,tomaiusa2002,"Good place to visit, to learn about the city, to take pictures, to eat around but it is very hot and humid during summer. "
Take Visitors there (At night),August 2016,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,anferpico,"Taking people to this area, and specially to the freedom tower at night makes the best pictures! Totally recommended."
Miami Landmark to see,June 2016,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,s4everfree,Freedom tower is a landmark and holds many memories of people who migrated to Miami in the 20th century.  The building holds different exhibitions throughout the year.  
So much history!,November 2015,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Nelly2876,"If you love architecture and history, you'll love the Freedom Tower.  Located in Downtown Miami, it's easy to get to and well worth the trip!"
Nice Old Landmark,October 2015,30,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,arturod71,"There is not much to see, only a great beautiful salon, it had an exhibition when I went but that is it."
Another Beautiful Area of Miami,August 2017,40,Coconut Grove,LouLouTravel74,"This area is worth a walk round. Some lovely cafes, restaurants and shops. Nice Harbour to take a stroll around. Not necessarily directly related to this area, but worth noting if you are not from the US. We parked in and dutifully paid by phone to park. On our return we had a parking penalty due to parking the wrong way up the road. This would not be a penalty in the UK and we were totally unaware that it was an issue here. It really ruined our visit."
Nice area to visit,August 2017,50,Coconut Grove,DagmarYlva,"This is a nice area to visit, lots of restaurants with friendly personnel, lots to do, go to a cinema, drink coffee at different places. "
 Not what I expected...,August 2017,30,Coconut Grove,FelocinNF," Considering the other reviews,  I was expecting a place where we could spend the afternoon,  have lunch,  and do some shopping.    This was true, but Coco walk was so small we did it all in 2 hours and still had time for a walk down by the marina.   Plenty of places to eat,  but I wouldn't recommend it for the shopping!"
One of the best parts of Miami,April 2017,50,Coconut Grove,LGolden33324,"This is one of the best parts of Miami. Central Coconut Grove has restaurant, shops, parks, historical houses. Just a nice place to park and walk around.  If you take Main Highway south you drive through tree covered streets with some of the nicest houses in Miami.  Always relaxing and interesting to visit."
Enjoyable art festival,February 2017,40,Coconut Grove,ZenMama17,Nice area and one can find the odd decent restaurant here as well. Not really a culinary destination but has good vibes. Spending few hours at the “art” festival is a decent diversion.
Presently going thru renovation Feb. 2018,February 2018,10,Miracle Mile,Teavelmia,"Usually a nice place with upscale stores, mostly bridal shops and jewelry stores. A couple of good restaurants."
"Carnival was good to walk through, nothing much there",March 2018,30,Miracle Mile,CharlotteKirsch,"Other than that, there isn’t a great deal other than loads of restaurants and shops. It’d not be my first stop on a Miami visit without an event. "
Freedom Tower - Museum,October 2016,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,IvetteD68,"Great History, Well Kept...Beautiful place to learn about this meant to immigrants.  Right across from bayside with gorgeous views but best of all great interesting place to learn."
Inspirational,August 2016,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,CarTin10,"Iconic building! This is where all immigrants were 'processed' during the influx of Cubans during the Missile Crisis, fantastic piece of American history."
What a story,November 2016,30,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Lynda L,We drove by this on our hop on hop off bus.  It is very nice looking and the story behind it is quite interesting.  Not sure if you can go inside but worth knowing about.
Short visit but loaded with history,November 2016,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Aneta2012,"Great place to visit to find out a little about the Cuban emigrants. If you have a relative or you are an emigrant yourself, you will relate to so many of the stories there. Quite emotional. Free entrance."
Essential for Understanding Cuban-American Experience,December 2016,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,RNatha,"This art deco building has served several purposes during its almost century of existence, but it is known as the Freedom Tower because many Cubans passed through it when escaping Cuba in the early 1960s.  The exhibit in the building provides a great overview of the Cuban-American experience in Miami.  There are also art exhibits with no connection to the building's history.  Plus, the building is pretty from a strictly architectural point of view."
Nice area,April 2018,50,Miracle Mile,rosalg02,This is an area to go for good restaurants and a nice stroll.  Inexpensive parking nearby at Andalucía Avenue. 
multi activities park,January 2016,50,Tropical Park,Jaime R,"great outdoor fun for the family, any and all kinds of family activities, bike, roller skate, baseball, soccer, tennis, volleyball, etc"
Important Part Of History,January 2017,30,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,SagaloutsTour,"This where all Cuban immigrants were processed when they first came to Miami. Worth seeing, again you can see it on the Hop on Hop off bus and get off to wander around."
"Interesting history, art and architecture",July 2016,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Jeffrey H,The Miami Dade College art collection is definitely worth a look as is the building and the murals on the first floor.  Must see the exhibit on the Cuban diaspora in the 1950s and 1960s.
Nice place,July 2017,50,Coconut Grove,Fahim N,"Beautiful place,, worth seeing. A must see location and nice development around the harbour. We had  nice time."
Not impressed,July 2017,30,Coconut Grove,TheRealGelatoGirl,"Or maybe I was just too tired or it was not sunny enough. Yes, It is a nice village like district with many cafes and some nice architecture. The marina with the boats and yachts are nice to look at and there is a lot of green. In general, tho, it did not strike me a something super special..."
Nice place,October 2016,40,Coconut Grove,Jazmin R,"It's a nice place to hangout, there's a fat Tuesdays and a pizza place that are really good. There's also a hookah bar in close proximity to the pizza place, although at times it can be very packed. I have visited on not so busy days and it's nicer to me because you have more room to walk or sit on the tables. I have gone during Halloween and it's fun however young kids should not go as it gets extremely crowded and there may be problematic teens and adults. Overall, it's a nice place to visit, nice area and stored to walk by. Coming at night is nice because they decorate with lights, especially in the holiday seasons "
Coconut Grave,June 2017,30,Coconut Grove,lsd f,"If you've got access to a time machine (or to Doc Brown's Delorean), set it for the 1970s (pre-Mayfair) and visit the Grove. Heck, even if you miscalculate and wind up in the early 80s (about the time of the Biscayne Baby night club), you'll enjoy yourself some. Now, its nothing more than a tourist trap. The last vestige of the vintage Grove, the waterfront Scotty's Landing bar and restaurant, is mostly a shadow of itself now, having been taken over by new corporate-minded owners. The Grove is gone, dead and buried in its grave."
Beautiful and Fun Area,July 2017,50,Coconut Grove,stbhatter,Great place to stroll and go to parks and restaurants. Parking was available. I highly recommend a list here when in Miami.
"The Freedom Tower. To the Cuban exile community this building is our ""Statue of Liberty"".",February 2017,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Mario L,"For many years this building was the ""Cuban Refugee Center"", this was the placed where Cuban political exiles came to be processed as they arrive in this line of LIBERTY. It served as processing center not only to be checked by doctors and other personal services but also provided information to the American government in other areas "

Quite the boulevard!,June 2018,50,Miracle Mile,Pineapples-a-Plenty,"The tropical setting with the gorgeous palm trees is stunning. It all makes for one terrific experience. Take a stroll along Giralda, one block north. A welcoming pedestrian mall. "
Very nice area to walk around!,January 2019,50,Coconut Grove,O82SHpetere,"Very nice area south downtown Miami. Walk around the streets with lots of trees and nice houses, walk down to the harbour and marina for a drink, food or walk in the parks there, and enjoy a nice ""city centre"" with restaurants and other nice places."
Walk around ,January 2019,40,Coconut Grove,1STEP4WARD,"Little historic buildings . Shops , restaurants, movie theatre in the area. Nice to take a walk . A lot of construction going on in the area so looks like a bigger shopping Centre will be opening in the future. Paid parking available."
Quaint and lovely,January 2019,50,Coconut Grove,LegallyDiva,We stayedc3 days in Coconut Grove. A great place to walk. No peacocks in Peacock Park but a nice stroll. Had a fantastic dinner at Jaguar! 
Spend the day,January 2019,50,Coconut Grove,catmanbruce,"Coconut Grove is a fun place to spend the day. Lots of small shops and outstanding restaurants. Presidents’ Day weekend it is home to one of the largest art shows of the year. Around 750,000 people over 3 days. Great artist and food as well. Big area set aside for kids, also bandshell with continuous entertainment."
Great Neighborhood,September 2018,40,Coconut Grove,M5406ATthomasl,"Coconut Grove is nice because it is just outside the heavy fringe of people traffic that Downtown Miami has.  It's a comfortable place to live a bit more laid back, nice grocery stores and a Home Depot when needed.  Close to Downtown Miami clubs, the Metro Rail, and Financial District.  Just has a laid back vibe, I love it there."
Love this area of Miami,March 2019,50,Coconut Grove,AmosC_13,"When we come to Miami, we always spend some time in Coconut Grove.  The restaurants are good and it has some nice shopping.  It is a very safe area as well."
Lovely area,March 2019,40,Coconut Grove,NewOrleansfirstgal,I am sure there must be many lovely homes but alot is behind walls or vegetation.  We couldn't see much from the bus.  There are some yards that have peacocks wandering around
Small hip Miami by the water,February 2019,40,Coconut Grove,RRaposoMiami,"Coconut Grove has changed over the many years I've spent time there. Still the Annual Coconut Grove Arts Festival is a must do each winter season. Once a hip and hippy artist hangout area, then a more corporate yet still somewhat hip local. You really have to walk the area to appreciate it. On the north end by the waterfront you'll find the tranquil David Kennedy Park, the as you make your way south along Bayshore Drive you come to the classic Grove restaurant, Monty's Raw Bar next to the marina. It's a must to try specially at dusk to early evening. You can continue south and check out The Fresh Market store, they sell everything in a unique place. There's Dinner Key and the Miami City Commission building next to the waterfront. While some large condominiums dot the landscape, the road if full of palm trees and the the feel of the water. The road ends and turns into McFarlane Rd. right at the historic Coconut Women's Club and Peacock Park. When a block later, the road meets both Main Highway and Grand Avenue you'll find the commercial center of the Grove. The 2 large shopping malls, CocoWalk and Mayfair. Cocowalk is now being remodeled to a more modern looking place. It has features lots of restaurants and boutiques over the years. The more interior designed Mayfair was once a high-end mall, now is mostly a corporate office complex and a hotel. There are several hotels if you want to stay, from the high-end Ritz-Carlton, the Sonesta Coconut Grove, to the less expensive Miami 4 Star Hotel Waterfront Oasis home of the Mutiny, and the Courtyard and Residence Inn, both by Marriott. Both Malls have large parking garages. A walk down Main Highway and you'll get a small feel for what the Grove used to be, small boutiques, restaurants and lots of large shade trees. You can enjoy and outdoor cafe like Greenstreet Cafe or Taurus Bar a little further down. The Barnacle Historic State Park is in this area, a former Victorian estate and bayfront park. On this water side of Main Highway there are lots of small streets with the tropical feel of a small town. If you go a couple more blocks south you can check out the Plymouth Congregational Church and it's lovey stone facade. Some Private Schools are located in this end of the Highway, so avoid it during drop-off or pick-up times. Otherwise it makes for a great drive further south into Coral Gables and Old Cutler Road."
Loved returning to Coconut Grove!,May 2019,40,Coconut Grove,oneupstatenewyorker,"The area is small, lovely and safe, on the ocean, with nice shops and good restaurants.  It's a great place to stroll around, particularly at night, when the temperature cools down a bit, and a good way to experience some of Miami's bounty.  Would love to spend more time there, but we've done long holiday weekends with friends, and it's been great."
"Miracle Mile, excellent place to dinner & walk with friends",May 2019,50,Miracle Mile,gladysmartinelli,"Last Friday I enjoyed a nice dinner and a walk along Miracle Mile; it was a pleasant and fun time because, after the renovations, the mile has resumed its natural beauty and pleasant atmosphere; visiting Miracle Mile is a very good option when you want to eat and walk through a classic and elegant place, with wide sidewalks, vibrant restaurants and bars, with shops whose well-decorated showcases catch the eye immediately."
"The rennovation is complete, but we have vacancies on the mile",May 2019,40,Miracle Mile,David B,"The rennovaton of Miracle Mile completed and some new shops have opened but we have several vacant storefronts now (rents higher?) on the mile.  The rennovation looks nice, but the Giralda Street rennovation may have taken away some restaurant traffic?"
More like a block or two. ,June 2019,30,Miracle Mile,barkus1968,There’s not a lot to do. 
"Safe location, lots of dining options ",January 2019,50,Miracle Mile,davidnmidi,"Miracle Mile is located in Coral Gables, Florida. It is an outdoor (possibly mile long) strip that offer lots of dining options and shopping. The area is generally safe, but definitely well kept.  Street or garage parking is available. Street parking requires you to download the Paybyphone app to pay for parking. "
Beautiful and Great Restaurants,July 2019,50,Miracle Mile,Q7946ZUjosep,In the heart of Coral Gables.  So much to do!
Great and amazing staff but not worth the hype,January 2019,20,ARTECHOUSE Miami,Sam_fl04,"We were drawn to Artechouse by posts on social media. When we arrived, parking was very hard to find and a parking garage nearby charged a steep and hefty price. Once we made inside, there are only ten instillations spread out over a small and compact area. While the staff is amazing and very kind and helpful, the entire walkthrough lasted about 20 minutes. It simply isn’t worth the admission price, a $10 entrance fee is much more reasonable for the amount of entertainment provided."
Amazing Digital Art Gallery,December 2018,50,ARTECHOUSE Miami,darkintersection,I look forward to their future exhibits.
Art,February 2019,40,ARTECHOUSE Miami,PetuliaS,This was a great interpretation of Art and a fun place to visit ... just wish it had more Exhibits as it was over too soon
Sparked an idea in my daughter,October 2019,50,ARTECHOUSE Miami,nomari2015,Well worth doing as a rainy day or a get out of the sun activity.
Must Visit!!!!,November 2019,50,ARTECHOUSE Miami,KlX1176UG,"One of the three ARTECHOUSE exhibits (NYC, DC, Miami) - came here during Thanksgiving week and had the whole exhibit to myself which was absolutely incredible. Stunning digital immersive art with the most friendliest staff. Just come, you will Not be disappointed.  "
Miami's central large park,June 2019,40,Tropical Park,RRaposoMiami,"Tropical Park has a bit of everything for anyone looking for nature and sports activities. Have been here over the years for many company and family picnics, for little league baseball and adult softball games in one of the several lighted fields including for soccer. There are ball courts and many rentable shelters and the pine trees and other landscaping. There's a lake and a football stadium as well. Cross Country teams love to train using the little hill near the Miller Road south side. Visited recently to view my son playing a night softball game."
A Gem in south Miami,December 2018,50,Tropical Park,foodtester214,"The place is awesome,, service by staff is great, clean and huge park. we had a christams pary in 2018 , 2017 2016 2015 2014 and so on . Thanks"
Family place or not,December 2018,50,Tropical Park,astrid m,"Great place to do anything even a Market place on Saturday.  Kids parties, events biking any excessive or any events to plan"
Best park in South Miami,October 2019,50,Tropical Park,The_travelingkitten3,"This has to be my favorite park in South Miami. It is huge and has a lot to offer. From classes to the track... the equestrian center and famous ""hill"" it is a wonderful park. Tropical Park also hosts events such as adoption events and games. "
Beautiful,December 2019,50,Tropical Park,Alejandraposadacid,"Family oriented, clean, good for training,  the have different sports classes,bootcamps,  good for kids parties,family gathers,etc"
"I was put off by the price, but it was worth every penny!",July 2019,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,VHikerChick,"I didn't think a two floor museum would hold my interest for 4 hours but it did! I had never heard of operation Peter Pan before so that in itself was worth the entrance fee. I manage programs for refugees and immigrants, so it was interesting to see what the refugees were given upon arrival. The museum was very educational and I highly recommend a visit there!"
Geocaching bought us here!,August 2019,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,wing6rider-Australia,"Well, a virtual cache based on the building.  This meant we got to appreciate some of the history of the building and have a look around.  We were not sure about the museum component as we wanted to do other things today.  So, might return, perhaps on a rainy day!  YMMV"
Freedom Tower,August 2019,40,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,tresmelange,"Although I didn't go to the art gallery in the Freedom Tower, I was able to appreciate the architecture from outside while taking a Big Bus tour across Miami. If you have an affinity for historical buildings, this one is great!"
Beautiful tower,October 2019,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,Boris M,"Freedom Tower is located just across the street from the American Airlines Arena, you can't miss it. I personally loved this tower, and it was lightened up pretty good."
A fun peak at History,October 2019,50,Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College,ElsieN99,The lobby and staircase are lovely.  It is a peak of what early Cuban exiles experienced upon arriving from Cuba 
"Nice People, Great Place & Fantastic Restaurants.",August 2019,50,Coconut Grove,Loucious,Coming to Miami? Stop by Coconut Grove and hang out with the locals! Stroll into CocoWalk for some shopping and even a bite. Then take a walk down to the local Peacock Park and check out the waterfront view of Biscayne Bay and it's mangroves. Always a delight to visit! GetSome!! 
Enjoyable afternoon...,June 2019,40,Coconut Grove,huggio,"Fun place to walk through, window shop, and stop for a bite. Seems like it would be a fun place to live near..."
Beautiful restaurants walking distance to our hotel!,September 2019,50,Coconut Grove,BrittanyRobey,"We stayed with icoconutgrove.com short term rentals, it was an amazing deal, beautiful place and didn't have to go far to have a relaxing day full of fun. Went to Greenstreet Cafe for breakfast, walked off the carbs through the trees of Barnacle park... then casually strolled around town into some shops ( all walking distance ). Decided to spend the later afternoon at our rooftop pool, showered in our room got dolled up for the night and headed to Lulus for drinks and dinner. The day/night was surprisingly effortless and easy!"
Fun view of Miami,October 2019,50,Coconut Grove,ElsieN99,Great place to see a variety of old  and new Miami.  Peacock Park and the Marina is always beautiful.  There is also the Barnacle House that is available for tours  Tons of great places to eat.  Drive south on Old Culter Drive to see some great older neighborhoods
Lovely place to visit,November 2019,50,Coconut Grove,CatherineA1461,LOVE this area! Definitely a keeper! The atmosphere is so laid back and upscale. Very pet friendly too.
The Miracle Mile is a joke ,September 2019,10,Miracle Mile,C9656MNsimonb,"Visited here on the way to Cuba. Walked the Miracle Mile looking for signs of life - failed to succeed. More bridal gown stores than I’ve ever seen in one place (what’s THAT about?!), lots of empty frontages disguised by posters, not a single store that you’d walk into. Do yourself a favour, just go to Plomo and get on the tequilas. "
The new Miracle Mile,September 2019,50,Miracle Mile,henri m,"Miracle Mile has been one of the most respected addresses for shopping, dining and theater for over 50 years but like anything it needed a refresher and our city beautiful government went into action and they have transformed it and I would tell my readers while in Miami come and see the upgrades that has been done in the last few years."
Great Place for Food & Shopping ,September 2019,50,Miracle Mile,1207las,"Since I was a kid have always enjoyed Miracle Mile in Coral Gables. There’s blocks of shopping, restaurants and bars. A bit pricey but there’s something for everyone. Must visit when in Miami. "
The place to be in Coral Gables,November 2019,40,Miracle Mile,cashcow100,"Lots of shops, restaurants and hotels available. Light night activity as well. Only problem is you must pay for on street parking 24 hours, seven days per week."
Coral Gables...a must visit!,October 2019,50,Miracle Mile,Prunellanj,Great downtown to walk around and visit some of the many great restaurants and beautiful architecture.
Do not go here!,August 2018,10,Hyde Beach,Crystal B,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! They discriminate!!! My husband and I went here on a Sunday afternoon, with maybe only 10 people in line, the bouncers completely ignored us. Two girls in front of us were told they wouldn't get in ""dressed like that,"" because they both had on one piece bathing suits and should have worn a bikini with heels if they want to get in. The girls were so discouraged that they said ""I guess we aren't hot enough to get in"" and stepped out of line. This is disgusting that an establishment would make people feel insecure about how they look. Cover charge was $50 for girls and $100 for guys...not to mention they will charge your card $250 with a ""holding"" fee and will not be reimbursed to your account for days. This place is pretentious and they should be ashamed of themselves!"
Do not go to the Hyde pool party if you are of colour,November 2018,10,Hyde Beach,Chaza13,Plenty more pool parties of better quality in Miami!
I felt like I was discriminated against,December 2018,10,Hyde Beach,Yasha T,I felt uncomfortable from the moment I walked in. The wait staff gave me dirty looks. I sat in the chairs along the poolside and no one helped me. I was there approximately an hour and no one asked if I needed a drink. The Waitresses avoided eye contact with me. It stinks because it's very nice aesthetically.
EXPENSIVE,December 2018,30,Hyde Beach,AlvinAbraham99,I drank in my room and saved a lot money. 
Fantastic First Visit,January 2019,50,"Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami",Dr_Kello,Don’t forget the sculpture garden because it is a quiet place where you can reminisce about the art you just witnessed.
A Beautiful Botanical Garden,November 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,CarpeDiem0212,"We highly recommend this garden for its grandeur, beauty and all those amazing trees, plants and flowers. It was an Amazing day at the Fairchild. Thank YOU!"
Dbcooperisalive gives this a 5 star review,December 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,dbcooperisalive,We drove for 2 hours to see Fairchild Botanical Garden for our first time. We loved this incredible place. We spent the day here and came back to see the Nightgarden light show. We bought a family membership so we will be back. A great perk is with a member you get in for free or discounted at other participating botanical gardens in the National botanical garden network. Great day yesterday
Night garden is stunning,December 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Jay D,"Look for the night garden fairy app before you go, it was well laid out with plenty of guides to help you along, the talking tree was especially funny.  Have you ever been to Avatar Land in animal kingdom, it is similar to that style of glowing gardens..."
Visitors from up North are entranced!,April 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,metracy2017,Entering the tropical atmosphere is thrilling.  Northerners are so happy with the warmth and humidity.  So much to see. The tram ride is just great!  You always learn something new.  Always!   It’s on my Must Do list for my frozen pals.
Night garden was outstanding. The place is beautiful.,December 2019,50,Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden,Greg P,This is a must to see the beauty of the garden is a delight to the eyes. We were in the night garden and our party was very impressed. Would recommend this to everyone in the area or who are visiting.
Viktoria Rocks!!!,November 2016,50,Hyde Beach,DoroDesigns,We went to the French and Famous night and enjoyed the live percussion with dj mixes and Champagne! Special thanks to our hostess with the mostess Viktoria who took care of us and made us feel chic and special! Great place in the evening on a beautiful Miami Beach night.
Outstanding bachelorette party,November 2016,40,Hyde Beach,contrerasmajo,"no easy to handle 12 mexican girls in a bachelor party, YOU ARE THE BEST"
Victoria is the best! ,November 2016,50,Hyde Beach,rikkiallen,"Last week I had some family in town for Thanksgiving. Being from Miami I really wanted to impress them. I took them to Hyde beach and Victoria made sure that our day was a memorable experience. Her inviting smile made everyone in our party feel comfortable, and her suggestions for what we should order were on point. She is lovely and friendly, and her service was impeccable. I highly recommend Hyde beach- and if you go I hope you get Victoria as your server! "
Excellent Experience at Pool Party; Jose is Great!,June 2017,50,Hyde Beach,Tom M,Jose and the rest of the Hyde team did an excellent job of encouraging a fun atmosphere while also controlling the chaos.  I will be back soon.
Pool Day,July 2017,40,Hyde Beach,Experience636048,"I visited this place Saturday 4th of July weekend. It's South Beach so be prepared to bring your check book, drinks are not cheap. This is a party place for sure. We order some Rose, bottle or Tito's and some wings. Service was good. Food was decent. I would recommend.  "
Wow. Stunning art,January 2018,50,Graffiti Gardens Miami,. G,"Not the nicest area to drive into but felt very safe and there are bus trips here from the hotel district. Wow, it's breathtakingly stunning graffiti art on old and derelict buildings and industrial installations such as cement works and warehouses. We paid to park in a parking lot for an hour thinking naively that was long enough. Advice- pay for 3 or 4 so you don't get wheelclamoed for overstaying paid time. There are cafes and restaurants and so much to see I wish we had had at least half a day there. It got very busy but we still managed to get lots of family photo shots. Don't miss out the shops on the street. I loved the plant shop particularly. Faces and designs in mosses and lichens on the walls. If you weren't flying home and could take them with you I would have bought someone a great birthday present. The coffee shop we went in was SO popular worth the coffee wait to use the toilet. A great find. Very highly recommended "
Tranquility in the middle of the city,July 2019,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Renata F,"Really nice park with natural swimming pool with a good structure to spend the day. There are bathroom, shower, restaurant, parking lot, etc."
Great spot for kids!,July 2019,40,Matheson Hammock Park,Mindfulalleycat,"Easy parking for the car, beautiful drive through the mangroves. Great little bay for the kids to swim. Lifeguard on duty. There was lots of seaweed there that day, but I understand they do clean it regularly. "
Love This Park/Beach Lagoon & Marina,September 2018,50,Matheson Hammock Park,George N,"This is a beautiful location to take pics, on the lagoon with the breathtaking view of the Miami skyline in the background - too bad the Red Fish Grill was destroyed in Irma and probably wont reopen - it was a delicacy amongst restaurants in Miami, possibly the best ambience of them all. Its was 6 Star +"
Nice small beach to go with kids,August 2019,40,Matheson Hammock Park,OlaFleur,"It used to look better as Hurricane Irma completely destroyed the are 2 years ago. But still a good place to go, specially with kids, as the area is very safe and there is just a few people swimming."
Matheson Hammock Park,September 2019,40,Matheson Hammock Park,387indy,"Matheson Hammock Park has trail, picnic tables, facilities, on lagoon, lifeguard, parking. Miami skyline as backdrop, and near Fairchild tropical botanic gardens."
North Shore,June 2019,40,North Shore Open Space Park,387indy,"North Shore Open Space Park is a beautiful area, has facilities, sand, parking,  maintained. Things to do in the area, restaurants, shops."
Unfortunately overrated party since other good options in South Beach,May 2015,20,Hyde Beach,Kevin S,"The Bottom Line - Overall....meh.  Unless you have a rich friend who wants to dump a few grand on a cabana, look for other fun beach spots with (slightly) less expensive drinks and better servers.  Crowd is just as pretty at the W."
Hyde,March 2015,30,Hyde Beach,JoannaMGR,I'd suggest Hyde more for pool parties in the day (holler big rubber duck!) and if you wanted a chill laid back beach bar vibe.
Pool party perfection,August 2015,50,Hyde Beach,Jamila P,"Davis, Sana, Tania and Jimmy. Gave us THE best service. The DJ was great, the pool was nice and the birthday presentation was the most tasteful but flashy way I've ever seen to tell everyone in the area that someone is celebrating a birthday. Sana and Davis made sure our drinks were never empty and Tania made sure the presentation and poolside pillow were in the right place at the right time. Jimmy made us feel like our things were always secure even when we weren't paying attention. All around this is an awesome time well worth the money. If you're looking for a pool party on South Beach this is the place."
great party with promoter,September 2015,50,Hyde Beach,miami v,the best pool party but use a promoter unless you want to be standing in the crowd of people for a few hours. Hyde beach promoter 1-850-228-1667. 
"Great staff, great crowd, great atmosphere",October 2015,50,Hyde Beach,FLBill,"Aside from South Beach prices, this place is a great spot to hang out and get out of the house. Classy crowd, great staff, awesome atmosphere. Music is loud enough to enjoy but not too loud to have a conversation. Pool is beautiful too!"
Nice Park,March 2018,40,North Shore Open Space Park,jointfilms,Was walking around and came across this park right along the beach. Restroom facilities. Picnic tables. BBQ grills to use. Exercise trail for fitness. Was here on a weekday and it wasn't very crowded and pretty quiet.
A beach in the south,October 2018,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Renato E," Family oriented, this is probably one of the best alternatives if you’re in the south and you don’t want to drive all the way to South Beach or key biscayne . It has a small beach protected from the ocean, I love it"
Family Time,December 2018,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Anadearmas,"Great place to walk with your family or just with your half. The sea breeze invite you to just contemplate this spectacular view. The bay was design for the little ones to swim, there are life saver. It is really a place for all ages."
Friday at Matheson Hammock Park,March 2019,40,Matheson Hammock Park,Pam L,"It was an idyllic day trip to Matheson Hammock Park! Located on a beautiful, nature park in Miami. It was quiet, relaxing at their small beach that has water coming in from the bay. At the shoreline, you can see some fish. Further in the water, it has grass which isn't my favorite, but the rest of this beach is perfect for sun bathing, reading a book, relaxing time with your spouse, or playing with your children. I use to bring my son here over 20 years when he was a toddler and I have fond memories."
Gorgeous Place and Gorgeous View,February 2019,50,Matheson Hammock Park,David A,"We took our kids to swim here decades ago, and still love to visit. The views of Downtown/Brickell, Key Biscayne, and South Beach from across the Bay are the best there is. When we take visitors at night, they literally gasp at the views. Can't wait for Redfish Grill to reopen."
Relax time,March 2019,40,Matheson Hammock Park,Ana_Ueda,"We went there on a Tuesday morning and there were few people in the beach, mostly families with babies (this place is very good for them indeed). It is a real nice place to relax, but unfortunately there was a part of the beach blocked for reform."
North Shore Open Space Park,February 2018,40,North Shore Open Space Park,LollysLook,North Shore Open Space Park is a quieter beach where you can find a stretch of sand and just relax without the crowds. There are lifeguards and restrooms.
RIP OFF,March 2014,10,Hyde Beach,Jim M,"Bought tickets to their Avicii Hotel events, and the main performer Avicii did not even show up.  Hyde beach club's response you scanned you ticket so even tho we did not give you what you paid for there will be no full or partial refund.  Hey Hyde I WILL NEVER COME BACK YOU ARE THIEVES!  YOUR CLUB SUCKED TOO! What bad service to steal from people after not giving them what they paid for. JERKS!"
Delicious Cocktails & Awesome Service,March 2014,50,Hyde Beach,CassieGrace26,"On Saturday, I spent my day at the Hyde Beach Club for a Bachelorette Party. The atmosphere was beautiful and had drinks at the hott trendy pool party that goes on at hotel. My drinks were all consistently perfected and Ricky my bartender was fabulous! He has a positive upbeat personality that kept me coming back for more. He was very busy but always attentive to my group of people. He made the party even better. We will definitely be coming back in a few months. Fantastic venue  !! "
fun nice atmosphere,June 2014,40,Hyde Beach,ocean68,"It is a really pretty well decorated lounge by the pool. Just don't expect to sit down unless you order bottle service. That will run you 500 and up. Drink are also expensive, 3 drinks 65.00. Not even fancy drinks just Vodka and soda. The music was great. We left because standing in high heels for hours hurts!"
Spectacular Hyde by Dimitri,July 2014,50,Hyde Beach,stamatios p,"2 pools, one quite and another one is more energetic. Great food and drinks selections, customer service is exceptional"
Simply amazing!!,August 2014,50,Hyde Beach,kfranklin43,"We have been to Hyde Beach for not only the pool parties but also dusk cockatils and partying at night. We have never been disappointed!!  Dave, the day server assistant, was so cool!  Super friendly and loved to talk!  Our day bed server Sandy was great!!  The hostess Jessica was so sweet!!  Super helpful! There was two other hostesses that worked during the day that were way stuck up really REALLY snotty.  Jessica was amazing!!  We will go back everytime we go to Miami!"
Macy's ,June 2017,50,The Falls Shopping Center,RawEsther,Associate Francisco in the men's shoe department was awesome He was super busy yet he help us completely with coupon and also suit cover for a suit.
great place,October 2019,50,Jungle Island,Wander36750885074,This is a very fun place to visit with a lot of activities for all ages. It is a bit expensive but overall very worth the cost.
"Terrible parking, too loud, animals bothered",November 2019,20,Jungle Island,joshdonath,"Hi I was super excited to bring my girlfriend to this event. Overall in theory it was pretty cool. Major issue is the parking, they’re charging $20 on top of the ticket price and there was no available parking, people illegally parked everywhere. Other issue is they were blasting music in random parts of the park and not in others it made no sense. Felt more like a child’s birthday party. Lastly some of the animals were still out and clearly upset from the darkness combined with loud music and kids yelling and people flashing lights in their faces for videos. Animals were clearly trying to hide in their enclosures and were pacing around. Pretty disappointed."
Luminosa,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,Orietta F,The lantern display is great! An opportunity to enjoy with friends and family. Jungle Island has really done an excellent job!
Great small beach for a quick swim,April 2018,50,Matheson Hammock Park,VacaCouple2014,We have been here many times. It is a small beach with an inlet. Shallow water. you will see families having a picnic with small children or teaching them how to swim. It is a lovely spot near Fairchild Tropical Gardens and you can spend an hour or more under the shade of the trees. Very nice spot for a swim. 
wonderful park,October 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,solenned212,"A beautiful park hidden in the grove. A really nice place to enjoy the beach or to go kayaking. Whatever the time of the day you go, it is gorgeons."
"Secure, comfortable beach area",August 2017,40,Matheson Hammock Park,expeditionkitty,Definitely a family area! Cant wait to visit again some time.
Nice attraction for kids,November 2019,30,Jungle Island,Joanna D,It’s a lovely place to go if you have kids. But if you go in a group of adults it’s not worth it. You’ll get bored really fast.  Also keep in mind parking it’s 20 dollars per car. So per person 40 a couple will end up paying 100 dollars. So try to not go in many cars otherwise you’ll end up paying much more. My recommendation it’s to buy online you save money and also time. Again it’s an attraction to go with kids. Not as a couple or friends. 
Relaxation,April 2018,50,Matheson Hammock Park,jeeplvr,Good place to visit to relax in the breeze and enjoy a view of the Bay. We go to watch the wind surfers and to relax
Nice relaxing area but need improvement.,August 2017,30,Matheson Hammock Park,sandradjanira,"nice relaxing area but the ""pool"" does not look clean at all. bathrooms are not clean, great parking. i have a service dog for my husband and we were given a hard time becose of it."
Great place,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,Yakdevo,"My one MAJOR complaint was that we splurged and took the picture with the parrots on our arm. The parrot on my arm turned its head just as the picture was shot. I said something to the lady, and she brushed me away and said it was fine. I asked her to look, and she said it was fine. Sure enough when we went to pick up our picture, the parrot on my arm had it's head turned to the back. I bought the picture anyway, but was definitely annoyed. Was a great visit, but to be honest, not worth paying full price. We got discounted tickets, and enjoyed ourselves very much. However, I think it's a one time visit place :)"
I love the solitude,April 2017,50,North Shore Open Space Park,TravelingJ2014,"I really enjoy walking or running up here after spending time in South Beach.  So disparately different, and yet the same beach.  Lovely spot for an early evening watching the sun low in the sky"
Nice and to crowded,December 2016,40,The Falls Shopping Center,HenkC123," If the wheater is nice and you don't like to much crowd, than this is a good option to walk around and look for the bargains in one of the shops."
Wonderful experience,October 2019,50,Jungle Island,DanielaKarla,I went to jungle island for the light show exhibit they have going on every night from 5-10pm. And it was truly such a beautiful sight. I went with my friends and they all loved it as well. I would definitely recommend everyone to check this place out for an experience you do not want to miss. 
Fun evening,October 2019,50,Jungle Island,GrandTour606096,We were in town only for the evening to leave for a cruise the next day.  I was scrolling the google map around our hotel and cruise port before we went for a fun dinner or something to do.  This is how I found jungle Island.  This was our favorite thing we have ever done in Miami. We got there early enough to see the bird show ( my husband loves birds) then we saw the Chinese acrobats. After that it was perfect darkness and weather to see all the lights.  This was so fun. 
Camp Day - 10/25/2019,October 2019,50,Jungle Island,anaiscorrea,"My kids loved the camp day. The organizer (Dana) answered all my questions and explained all the details pertinent to the food and drop off / pick up times. The activities we very well organized, they had an amazing, educational and fun time. They are looking forward to the next one. The only suggestion I have will be not to charge for parking, since we are only dropping off / picking up and it did not take any more than 5 minutes. "
Nice little gem of a park,March 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,916angelof,A very nice picnic spot for anyone.
A bit tired and needs some new stores,December 2016,30,The Falls Shopping Center,Travel2andFr0m,One good spot are the restaurants - good selection.
My hometown park in ruins😥,December 2017,10,Matheson Hammock Park,susanhorn4life,This is the happy place of my childhood. Even in Ruins it's got my whole entire heart. I do not recommend you take your families at this moment this covered by tape destroy building in boats. That we all I know you can still go out there and rent a kayak . Matheson hammocks will rebuild
"A Very Old, Pretty Swimming Hole",January 2017,30,Matheson Hammock Park,fhdkf,"My father used to bring me to Mathewson Hammock when I was a child, about 50 years ago!!!  I still go there.  It's very pretty. It could be cleaner and when the tide comes in and out it can be a little smelly.  But if you are a tourist, take a ride out there.  Very pretty spot."
Nice place to spend sometime enjoying the sunset,July 2017,40,Matheson Hammock Park,Willians M,"Matheson Hammock Park is an excellent place to come and enjoy the sunset. The best time to come is during the week, this way won't be so crowded and you'll enjoy it better. There are parking spots very close."
Rustic,December 2017,30,Matheson Hammock Park,Pineapples-a-Plenty,"Lots to see, and pretty basic in terms of infrastructure. You can get a good view of Miami, and Biscayne Bay. The palm trees are beautiful!"
Luminosa was amazing!,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,tarajewelz6,The place was great! Only thing is I would have loved to buy something at the gift shop but the prices were outrageous!
Great relaxing beach,August 2016,50,North Shore Open Space Park,seanbelanger1,"Relaxing, peaceful beach, great area for bbq and rentals for kite boarding and paddle boards on the weekends."
Rated R,September 2016,40,North Shore Open Space Park,peteivonne,Cool place for spending time in the sun.  Lots of people  It's right in the middle of all the action but don't bring the kids 'cause they'll get more than a tan here. Bathing suit optional
Fabulous shopping,August 2016,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Poolegirly,"This mall is fantastic, it is semi-open air and has a really good range of stores. We came in particular to Yankee Candle, where staff were really helpful, also went to several other stores including Abercrombie and Fitch where again the staff were excellent. Would certainly recommend for a good retail therapy resort, not huge but well considered stores. This is not an outlet mall so you are paying full retail prices, the service is reflected."
Nice place to visit ,September 2016,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Saja S,There is PF changs near by  
"Too expensive, poor quality of food and service",October 2019,10,Jungle Island,Tal B,"For 2 adults and 3 kids we paid approximately 150$ for the tickets, 60$ for a hot dog and 2 kids pizza and $20 for the parking. Honestly, it wasn't worth the expense. "
Luminosa!,October 2019,50,Jungle Island,Carolina L,"LOVE IT!! Me and my parents enjoy it very much... we didn't know this park, is very pretty and is totally recommended... thanks"
Surprisingly cute,January 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,javiguemes1,"The last thing I was expecting was to find a beautiful ""swimming pool "" in the middle of the ocean surrendered by great vegetation and amazing views. Great facilities like restroom and changing area, pick nick area and Also next to the parking lot, water sport equipment for rent. This is a nice scale fir the traditional Miami Beach. "
Lovely atoll with great views,July 2017,40,Matheson Hammock Park,Gator2knight,"Highlights of the park are the view of Miami skyline and the atoll. The atoll is a protected swimming hole which is great for kids because there are lots of things to see there including starfish and all kinds of sea critters. Lifeguards are on duty. Sand is quite hard. The atoll is also lovely to walk around. This is a good place to launch your kayak--also you can rent kayaks here. There is a dinner only restaurant, Red Fish Grill which is quite lovely but has mediocre expensive food. There is also a busy marina with stations for cleaning your fish. Large iguanas can always be seen hanging around the marina"
Great place to visit for families or couples in love.,April 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,622elianap,"Whether you are there with one or many, Matheson Hammock has much to offer.   The Red Fish Grill is a lovely and delicious restaurant.  The beach area is small but has a great view of the bay and lots of beautiful boats speeding by.   There are also wooded areas great for picnicking and playing family/group games.  There is a very nice boat launch, but come early as the wait can be quite long."
lovely views,January 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Diane A,"marvelous place to bring children...a nice lagoon for smaller ones to toddle in, the walks are lovely..and the added bonus of a fine dining seafood place nearby."
Pregnancy photoshoot. Spectacular park!!,November 2016,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Flor D,"Hi guys!! Flor here. It has been a while. I gave birth to twins recently. I am back though!! Ok, first this park. Had my pregnancy photoshoot at this location and I was IMPRESSED by its beauty. It is a breathtaking park. It has a small but nice beach and the vegetation is so lush, you will NOT believe you are in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Coral Gables!! The trees are its best feature, giving it a feel of a tropical forest. They made my pictures so dreamy!! See attached pics. It is perfect for picnicking and relaxing because sea breeze keeps it cool. It has a rental cabana for parties (perfect for baby showers), restaurants, and a nice long trail for bikes or just walking and enjoying nature. A must see if you visit Miami. Cars pay $5 during weekdays and $7 on weekends. Really worth it! LOVE IT"
"Dirty, animals uncared for",October 2019,10,Jungle Island,tsujnami,"So much under construction, paths weren’t clean, animals looked dismal, poor condition overall. Do right by these animals, at the least. I don’t mind a dirty path if the animals are cared for better. Saw multiple birds dead in the flamingo pools..."
Not worth it,October 2019,10,Jungle Island,susie697,"Would not go back. Overpriced and my kids were bored. I was also bored. Monkeys also looked sad and bored. I would’ve walked out as soon as I walked in, but well i was already there and had paid."
Excellent for kids,October 2019,50,Jungle Island,Pipo R,"Everything was extremely clean and talen care of, fun place and coourteous crew! Must visit if u hace small kids"
Very Nice,April 2016,40,North Shore Open Space Park,Luvs2TravelAnywhere,Very nice park and beach with restrooms and jogging/walking path. I found this on one of my morning walks and really enjoyed the change of scenery on the path with the trees. 
This place is AWESOME!,May 2016,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Emily K,"Having so much outdoor space this close to the beach that is both sunny in spots and shady in spots was incredible! We had a post-wedding BBQ here with friends who were married the day before. The pavilion was great and it has outdoor showers and bathrooms available. We spent the entire day here eating, playing games and soaking up the sun and sand before heading back home. It was very family friendly with lots of kids in the water and building sand castles. It was very different from the South Beach end. "
Outdoor Shopping Mall,March 2016,40,The Falls Shopping Center,Marlon N,Hardly ever crowed with a movie theater inside. Outdoor shopping mall. Parking is usually always available and you have plenty of dining options on the outer parts of the mall.
Beautiful Waterfalls,May 2016,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Anissa L,"great restaurants, amazing food...everything you want you can get at The Falls."
Beautiful Mall!,January 2016,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Christine C,"We visited this shopping place in January 2015.  This was on my birthday trip. Beautiful warm weather during winter.  We love it!  I bought a nice whiter sweater at one of shops there.  And we went to a movie there, too.  Fun!"
A bit small,May 2016,40,The Falls Shopping Center,SimonR661,This is a smaller mall with a lot of class. It is themed around a tropical stream which is very attractive and calming. It has two large stores and a myriad of higher end smaller outlets and independent shops. It has several restaurants. One of my favorite is Friday's. It also has a cinema but unfortunately because it is an older mall the seating reflects this. No amphitheater like with the newer ones.
Good luxury shopping.,June 2016,40,The Falls Shopping Center,102susie,"This mall is very nice. It has a theater, you walk around outdoors amidst ponds and waterfalls. It is more for the high-end shopper."
Beautiful peaceful setting,April 2017,40,Matheson Hammock Park,fhalvarez22, park is really worth seeing. They have nature trails through mangrove trees.It has a Pond and a Marina. You can sometimes see an alligator in the pond. It also has a very beautiful picnic area among the oak trees and at the very and there is a beach lagoon that is very peaceful and is very good for children as it has no waves.
Nature's Delight,February 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Loubna N,Best place to watch the sunset away from the noise and crowds. The area is a hidden gem magically behind a huge park and surprisingly striking and full of life. The pictures tell it all. 
Easy and quick getaway,February 2017,30,Matheson Hammock Park,MayaLacayo,"If you are looking to get to the beach without the hassle of driving to Miami Beach, then Matheson is the place for you. You have tons of activities, from biking to kayaking and paddle board. You also have a atoll - pool where you can take the kiddies without the fear of them swimming out to the deep blue. Definitely family friendly."
Restful day with our feet in the sand,April 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,jodyj321,"It was a tough week in the business, I was exhausted, tempted to go to Friday night happy hour. We went to the beach at matheson hammock instead and sat in our beach chairs watching the sunset. Better choice, calming choice. It's one of the best views in Miami. "
"Calm, beautifulo, relaxing!",May 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Joseph E,"I've been going to Matheson Hammock Park since 1954 when my family moved to South Miami.  Although there have been some changes, the Park has remained just as beautiful and relaxing now as it has always been.  Probably my favorite place in all of Miami area!"
I LOVE THIS OPEN PARK RIGHT ON THE BEACH !!!,June 2016,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Frank d,I have a niece who used to live just across the street from this park. We used to come here for picnics every time I visited. This is the way Miami Beach and other communities along the coast used to be when I lived in the area. I believe this might be the only open park space still available for public use at no charge. I hope it remains this way for many years to come.
Great place to visit,July 2016,40,North Shore Open Space Park,Jackie E,"Relaxing beach; not crowded. Park is nice & shady, accessible bathrooms & outdoor shower, grills. Paid street parking $2/hr."
Homeless Rule!,August 2015,10,North Shore Open Space Park,U2387MHraymondl,"Paid $350.00 to reserve a pavilion for a family gathering at the park. Arrived at the reserved pavilion only to discover it occupied by 5 homeless people. After explaining that we had reserved it, they reluctantly moved 15 feet to the next pavilion. As our younger members began to arrive they were introduced to the park by the cursing and fighting among the now 10 mentally ill homeless people in the next pavilion. During our barbecue the homeless sent a representative over to beg for food. About an hour later, two park maintenance men in a truck showed up. They warned us not to leave any valuables lying around because the homeless are known thieves. This made being close to the beach totally superfluous. It is obvious that those responsible for the park security have completely abdicated their responsibility for safety and security of legitimate users and renters. This is truly a horrible place to try and relax and enjoy the amenities."
LONG WALK,August 2015,50,North Shore Open Space Park,IMLeonTerzi,"OMG! We never thought we would get back to the car! Its a long walk, and be sure to do it early in the morning or very late afternoon. Sea view is absolutlely fantastic! Dont miss it."
They said this is the best mall in Miami!,July 2015,40,The Falls Shopping Center,hyprsts,I love the water features! I love the relaxed pace. Most shopping centers/areas are teeming with so much activity that you can't enjoy it. It was a relaxing day for shopping.
Best option in South Miami,July 2015,40,The Falls Shopping Center,MCN73,"The Falls Shopping Center is one of my favorite malls in Miami, if you are going to be around the South.  It has all the stores you typically look look for and need, and even some stores which are sometimes difficult to find elsewhere, for example American Doll (which is huge, even with a place to have ""coffee"" with your daughter and her dolls), Abercrombie Kids, etc.  The mall is the outdoor type, so it is nice and pleasant to walk around, and has restaurants and a movie theater if you want to take a break.  Since it is not the typical ""tourist"" mall, it is not crowded and service is personalized.  It is also not as large as Dadeland Mall, so I find it easier to go with kids and walk around and not be afraid to get lost from your group.  You find plenty of parking space which is comfortable with your shopping bags and it only has one level so not to worry about stairs or elevators. Perfect!"
"A pretty setting, but shopping was ok.",September 2015,30,The Falls Shopping Center,Ruth H,"We were here during the week and it was like a ghost town. The selection of stores is ok, but nothing new or different."
The Falls Shopping Center.,April 2015,30,The Falls Shopping Center,SX92,This is a mid-sized mall with a limited selection of stores. Not a good place to go when its raining
"The La Hacienda Restaurant, The Falls Shooping Center, South Miami FL",October 2015,30,The Falls Shopping Center,aguacal,The waiters are not that happy looking but they are attentive. Lunch for two: $18.oo
"Clean park, nice environment, good atmosphere",June 2015,40,North Shore Open Space Park,rmathijssen,Nice park to visit. Everything looks clean and the atmosphere is great. Good facilities to BBQ or just picnic. Nearby the beach what's make it a good combination to give the park a visit with the whole family
"Great view, but not tourist friendly",January 2017,30,Matheson Hammock Park,David C,"It cost $7 to enter and they were all out of maps, so we had no idea where to find trails or whatever else might be available.  We did find the main parking area where there was a beach and a beautiful view of downtown Miami."
Laid back and family friendly,December 2016,40,Matheson Hammock Park,M1388HJlaurap,"Perfect to bring kids to, great for walking and good biking areas. You get a beautiful view of the miami skyline and wind surfers from the parking lot."
Nice and quiet park,January 2017,40,Matheson Hammock Park,albertom675,"Lots of trails. Even had Hobbie kayaks and kite surfing for rent. Some areas allowed grilling and great for BBQ under a tree with the ocean view. There was a wedding at the the natural ocean pool. Beautiful place to go if you don't want to go in the water, not south beach ocean but white nice sand for tanning. "
Lovely Park,December 2016,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Heidi1226,"Matheson Hammock Park is just delightful!  Lovely beach area with lifeguards and picnic tables all around.  You can visit the Red Fish Grill for a meal, or bring your own picnic like we did.  The kids explored on the rocks over-looking the water.  A must see!"
Wonderful park with lots of options for fun,February 2017,50,Matheson Hammock Park,traveljules2016,"This is a great park that offers places to kayak, swim at a beach, walk along the bay and sit and enjoy the gorgeous views. We went to see the sunset.  Highly recommend this as a place to visit in Miami.  You can see the sunset from one side and then see the skyline of Miami from the other. "
Great view,December 2014,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Zola1961,Take a walk down here and look back on the whole of Miami beach . Great to watch the ships as well . Easy to cycle there 
North Shore Open Space Park,May 2015,50,North Shore Open Space Park,T0urist7,"North Shore is a lovely, beautiful park.  It makes a difference to the South Beach. You do not find in North Shore skyscrapers, concrete boardwalk and crowd. You can choose what do you prefer."
Nice Beach,April 2015,40,North Shore Open Space Park,mmklan,"We are staying in the Keys, which don't have sandy beaches.  So we ventured up to Miami, and found this beach.  It is relatively quiet, and nearby parking is easy.  It has some seaweed, but that wasn't a big deal.  We had an enjoyable day,."
Friendly outdoor mall,February 2015,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Dushisun,This is a very friendly open mall. Spacious and lots of places to sit outside to have lunch/dinner or a coffee. Shops are for all family members. Including a Apple store which is not as busy as in Dadeland Mall.
nice outdoor shopping center,April 2015,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Jeff P,Many options from local to name brand stores.  Pleasant outdoor experience.  Nice food options also.  Lots of outdoor seating and several restaurants. 
Outdoor shopping at its best!,April 2015,50,The Falls Shopping Center,MiamiScubamom,"This is my favorite outdoor shopping mall.  I love the waterfalls and how the river and pools run along the entire length of the mall.  Macy's and Bloomingdales are the anchor department stores.  There are many other stores in between, The Apple Store, American Girls, The Gap, Gymboree, Bath and Body Works, and much more.  There is also a movie theater and many restaurants for all budgets.  The lights at Christmas are spectacular.  "
Outdoor Mall With Typical Mall Stores,December 2014,40,The Falls Shopping Center,Linnea P,"But the best time to visit in my opinion is at Christmas time when all the decorations and lights are up. The weather is better and not so humid as it is an open mall, but the crowds can be quite bad. I usually will go to the Bath and Body Works sales and that is about it. Sometimes I may browse in Hot Topic. Macys can have some good sales, but I rarely find anything worthwhile buying. I tend to visit every time I am back in town, but I wish there was more variety of stores."
"Good for shopping, strolling, dining",April 2015,40,The Falls Shopping Center,MEM1988,"This shopping center has smaller stores as well as the Macy's & Bloomingdales anchor stores. There's a nice size theater and plenty of dining available:  whether you want, pizza, crepes or icecream to fancier fare (Los Ranchos, Tuscan Grille, BJs Brewery) you will spend a pleasant afternoon strolling The Falls!"
Nice and Chill,April 2015,50,North Shore Open Space Park,X9529HCericm,This place is great! not too many people but enough to keep you entertained. Beaches are sandy and shallow for the kids. 
great option out of Miami Beach area,May 2015,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Alex d,"NOrth Shore is one of the best options when Miami Beach is full of tourist and you want to stay at Miami Beach Area, the park is very nice, is clean, and you can park on public parking. "
a peaceful place to relax on a lazy afternoon,June 2016,50,Matheson Hammock Park,henri m,I spend many afternoon and morning after my bike ride A bit of sun wind and a snack at the local restaurant located at park
Quiet urban beach escape,August 2016,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Jeffrey H,"Settle down, relax and take in a bit of ""old Florida"" at this wonderful park.  There were manatees when I was last there and the lagoon is wonderful for kids."
A beach alternative on the bay.,October 2016,40,Matheson Hammock Park,Foodiepaul,Please note that if this is your first time to area take time to enjoy drive in and out as it is surrounded by beautiful neighborhoods and landmarks. Enjoy ! 
My favorite spot in Miami to see the sunset ,October 2016,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Lrodri1498,I strongly recommend it 
Great Place to Sit but Not Much Else!,September 2016,30,Matheson Hammock Park,WD80,"I was in Miami for a couple of days and decided to visit the Grove first, then made a pit stop at the Park.  I have not been here in years and is not as nice as I remember.  The pool area is small but fairly empty.  But for the hang gliding outside of the Park, there was not enough going on to keep me interested for long.  After just sitting for about 20 minutes, we left. Also, there is a charge for parking that I didn't recall before."
Bark Beach,May 2015,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Anna K,"On the weekends from 3-7 pm, pay $25 (non-resident) to take your dog to the beach.  You need the rabies dog tag for entry and pet must be on leash.  Take a blanket, towel and enjoy the beach with your 4 legged friend. Entry between 80th and 81st street on Collins Ave.  Check out the park website.  "
"Calm, convenient beach",February 2014,50,North Shore Open Space Park,CSturgeo,"If you, like me found the crowded chaos of Miami Beach a turn off, check out this beautiful public beach with ease of parking and restrooms. This may be more crowded on weekends but for week day travelers it was a welcome respite. Located just north of 79th St. there is a parking lot across the street within easy walking distance. The parking machines will get a an unlimited time for $8. We couldn't even find a way to get out of our car the previous day (Sunday). Thjis beach is one used by the locals."
Beautiful & Quiet Beach,February 2014,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Suzanne_Schiff,"This beach was very quiet and clean.  It was a short walk from where I was staying, and there are also public restrooms if needed.  The water was calm and it was the perfect place to relax and soak up the sun!"
Excellent mall to shop or just hang out and eat,January 2014,50,The Falls Shopping Center,FloridaLadyaya,"Spacious and clean, real cool atmosphere with the water falls and the covered walls with Brito Brito's art makes it specially trendy.  I went with my family which includes teens and elderly and everyone had a great time.  Nobody was ready to go home."
My favourite mall,April 2014,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Chrisjalex,"Macy's, Bloomingdale's, A&F as well as cinema and places to wat."
Excellent Shops,May 2014,50,The Falls Shopping Center,flomarte,"All  shopping experience for different pockets. Clean, very good eatery s, relax atmosphere and romantic landscaping."
Excellent shopping expirience!,May 2014,40,The Falls Shopping Center,Analurivera,"The Falls has most of all the stores you need in an outdoor mall. The mall is nice and it's not so crowded, excellent for stress free shopping. The down side is that since is open air when the climate gets hot you feel it. Also when it rains really hard you are most likely to get a little bit sprinkled. But all in all is a great place to shop and hang out."
Open Air Shopping,June 2014,30,The Falls Shopping Center,MrMiamiExplorer,"The Falls Shopping Center has always been one of my favorite malls. It is an open air mall, which gets its name because many of the shops are centered around man-made ponds, streams, and waterfalls. These waterways were filled with bright koi fish when I was little, but have since been chlorinated. There is nice landscaping around these waterways as well. Often you will see ducks wander into the mall from the canal behind it to go for a swim in the chlorinated ponds. I hope they don't drink too much of the chlorinated water. It is a nice place to walk around and window shop, or just sit by the waterways and talk. Unlike the open air shops of Bal Harbour, Sunset Place, or Bayside where they greedily charge a fortune to park, parking is free at The Falls! It is however sometimes a nightmare to find parking on weekends. You may have to park at the far back of the mall (South Side). Another negative is the rudeness and unprofessionalism of the security guards. On more than one occasion myself and my friends have been stopped and/or harassed. Last year a security guard stopped us because he said it was suspicious that we were walking around and texting! Seriously? Many I have seen are very obese, and I have seen them use scooters just to get around. In my opinion the current ones should either be terminated, and/or required to take a mandatory class on customer service. I visited the Fresh Market on this visit and was surprised that the prices for some of the produce wasn't as bad as I'd heard. The Fresh Market is located on the same property and is fun just to browse even if you don't need any groceries. The market's interior is decorated like an old time country general store. I've brought many people to the Falls, who had never visited before, and despite the negatives, will keep coming back."
"Same beach, not as crowded",April 2014,30,North Shore Open Space Park,Emily A,"Good place to go for sand, ocean, surf, swim, basic amenities and not as crowded.  However, if you want ""the scene,"" head to South Beach."
Great local beach!,May 2014,40,North Shore Open Space Park,Kellemjones,"Clean beach, easy access.  Water is nice too!  Dog park nearby!!  Metered parking, bring change. Life guard on duty."
North shore park,February 2014,50,North Shore Open Space Park,610andrewt,"A beautiful quiet and very large park on the beach parallel to the A1A between 63rd and 81st ( about). Great for strolling ,biking BBQ and pets."
Beautiful Views/ Disgusting Atoll,July 2016,10,Matheson Hammock Park,MattL132,"The hotel that we are staying in recommended the manmade atoll at Matheson Hammock Park as a great place to swim and see some exotic fish. With this in mind we wanted to make sure that we made time to visit while in Miami. This was a huge mistake. While the park did offer some pretty impressive views of the Miami skyline, the manmade atoll was disgusting. The water was black and smelled like raw sewage. The smell was heavy in the air and we couldn't even stay long to enjoy the views. Skip this attraction, at least for now."
"""Worth a look""",July 2016,20,Matheson Hammock Park,epuya,I do not plan to go back because there was nothing there that would prompt me to visit the park again.
A sheer delight,November 2015,50,Matheson Hammock Park,bowdlerb,"You have got to make time to see this place, especially around dusk, when the colours are at their best."
Great Experience,July 2016,50,Matheson Hammock Park,Dayana F,"This park is awesome. Family friendly. The beach is great, has its private, no animal encounters. Great for picnics too."
Miami,July 2016,50,Matheson Hammock Park,lmg2727,"One of my favorite spots in Miami. Great for children of all ages, very family oriented, quite and a great place to enjoy with family and friends. "
Best Kept Secret In Miami Beach,June 2015,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Secretcustomer25,"North Shore Open Space Park is really the beach and what a Beautiful uncrowded, even when its crowded beach is great. They call it a park because they have BBQ pit, and restrooms and some exercise stuff. The beautiful beach is six to ten feet away. Don't trust me the next time you are in Miami Beach you tell me!"
Nice and quit beach,August 2016,40,North Shore Open Space Park,r4m1n,As nice as the south beach but less crowded. If you prefer busy beach go to the mid/south beach. Most restaurants are also at south beach.
"I love this mall, it is so different even just to walk around",December 2012,50,The Falls Shopping Center,denise c,This is an open air mall with Macy's and Bloomingdale's as their main department stores.  They also have Williams-Sonoma and Crate and Barrel along with many other great stores for anything you might need to buy.  They have evening concerts on weekends and a lot of good restaurants.  The mall is surrounded by small waterfalls and during the holidays the decorations are beautiful.
Great place to shop and visit,December 2012,40,The Falls Shopping Center,Jrprez,"It's also just a pretty outdoor mall and is a great place to stroll through with a date, especially at Christmas time.  "
The worst transportation connection ever experienced,February 2013,10,The Falls Shopping Center,Manoela  Talula V,Never again!
Easy shopping,February 2013,40,The Falls Shopping Center,Rosalie D,They offer an excellent variety of stores to choose from. 
Great Mall but watch out for thieves,April 2013,20,The Falls Shopping Center,NoRInBath,"This is an open air mall with Macy's and Bloomingdale's. They have the upmarket stores such as Pandora, Abercrombie and Hollister. As it is open air it is comfortable to shop in. Before we went we looked at all the reviews and decided that it was in a good area with security guards around the place. We decided to stop off on our way to the airport. We left our car for 40 minutes and when we returned it had been cleaned out. All of our suitcases had been pulled through the smashed drivers window. The car was less than 50m from Macys front door yet there was no vidoe footage as apparently according to the security guards there arent any video cameras there. I watched the security guards who ride around on bicycles but not through the carpark just around the perimeter of the shops. We met another customer there who had bought a TV and put it into his car at the same Mall when he came back the car had been broken into and the TV taken. He and we, were sure we had been watched as the windows in the cars were blacked out. this was not a one off incident in this Mall and they need to take security more seriously."
Nice outdoor Mall,September 2016,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Ana U,"The Falls is a great, nice, convenient, beautiful and big shopping mall!! You have to know that since it's an open kinda mall you have to go as comfortable as you can. They have in the middle of all the mall a beautiful water landscaping, so if your not into shopping you could just go sit and relax!! The only detail that was off for me and my family was the restaurants locations, They are all spread out and I couldn't find a food court....had to walk a lot to find a restaurant that for my taste was a little to expensive!! Don't get me wrong, food was great but when you go shopping sometimes you just want and need fast food because of your time!! "
Great place to outdoor mall shop,October 2016,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Marlon N,Has big name stores like Macys and Nordstrom and also has regular stores like pandora and apple. it is nice for a mall because it is outdoor. there is a movie theater there as well. 
Great shopping mall,August 2016,50,The Falls Shopping Center,davidgZ8895DN,"Great place to spend time with someone. Amazing decorations. Has a lot of known stores like pandora, apple, Macy etc. "
Don't go in the water,July 2015,20,Matheson Hammock Park,Jerry P,"As a local, none of us ever go there.  Too many other places to get you're feet wet.  Please don't go in that water."
At the Atoll - nice & quiet,April 2016,40,Matheson Hammock Park,Renee L,"We have here twice during our visit. It's nice having a contained, quiet area for the kids to play. A beach within a beach. Water not too deep until you get far into the middle. The second day we were there the waves had stirred up so much of the muck that was at the bottom that the water looked murky and not as nice as the first day we went. My son did not mind! Nice palm trees offering shade. Restrooms right on site - and a changing area/outdoor shower near the parking lot.It's only a short walk from the parking lot to the Atoll. Recommended if you want a quiet place to relax on the sand near the water."
Great Quaint Beach...When you find it,May 2016,30,Matheson Hammock Park,tamanishajohn,"After finally getting to the beach, it was beautiful. An actual beach within a beach that isn't crowded like South Beach. The atmosphere was really nice, chill, and laid back. A lot of little kids playing and just enjoying the beach, some people swimming. The floor (sand) inside of the water felt a bit sticky, but I believe that was to be expected. Other than the confusion of getting to the beach, it's a really great beach and the park seemed to have a lot of other activities as well. P.S. No beachwear permitted in Red Fish Grill...although it's next to the beach."
great views of miami,May 2016,30,Matheson Hammock Park,France R,"atoll beach, nice restaurant and picnic area, however cleanliness is lacking.  the kids are protected and the beach is lifeguarded. best aspect is the location, which affords a fantastic view of the sea, the palm trees and miami beach in the distance."
Beach area!!,April 2016,30,Matheson Hammock Park,lalocadr19,"Park does not have a biking/walking trail. The park does have roads that have access to beautiful beach, fishing area,and amazing forest area great for picture. Price for entrance $7.00"
BEST VENUE FOR A CONCERT!,February 2017,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,C7226DKmariar,"I also recommend you leave plenty of time to get there, especially if there are events going on in Miami Beach.  The traffic can get kind of crazy!"
I love this place,September 2011,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Keiko96,Very well kept up mall. When we lived in the Miami are we used to shop here all the time. Even as a visitor we still shop there. The stores are more higher end so if your looking for budget shopping this place doesn't really have it.
visiting the Falls,June 2012,50,The Falls Shopping Center,lori46Orlando,"Went by the Falls Shopping Center Mall to visit and drop off package for a relative of a friend of ours, who has a jewelry store located at the Falls, his store is called Mr. Fix It and is located near   Bloomingdale and a new store that is going in next to him called American Dream Girl. It's going to to a big store. We have not been to the Falls since we moved from there to Orlando area.  The Falls has changed and its even more beautiful and so many stores and places to eat and go to the movies.  We had a great visit and enjoyed walking around seeing the water fountains and flowers."
The Falls - open-air mall,May 2012,50,The Falls Shopping Center,KrysiaK,The Falls is one of my favorite places to shop in Miami because it combines great shopping and restaurants with a pleasant outdoor shopping experience; this mall features top department stores and specialty stores. This mall has benches near an outdoor waterfall.
Good venue in terrific location ,February 2017,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Pomerols,"The Jackie Gleason theater (The Filmore) is a great venue and we go there regularly.  Saturday night, I was lucky enough to see Sting!  The theater is older, with not enough bathrooms for women (very very long lines)  but the acoustics are amazing.  Also great is the wide space between rows with comfortable seats.  We always like to arrive early and park at the 17th street garage.  While valet parking is available, it takes forever to get your car back.  We also like to walk on Lincoln Road (a few yards away) and have dinner at one of the many nice restaurants found there.  The traffic is horrendous but that South Beach..."
A class experience,February 2017,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,angelak336,"Great location. Nice venue. A standard with locals, and hopefully you are lucky enough as a tourist to visit it. They have great shows, from varying styles."
Great place,November 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Jennifer R,This place has some great performers that come through here. Just be sure to have good seats and look up before you purchase your tickets. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. 
COZY VENUE,December 2016,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,629denisev,Love this venue its a part of old south beach and all the seats are good seats since the venue is not huge.
Nice place,November 2016,50,North Shore Open Space Park,mmikko,"A nice beach and park, a place for bbq or picnic. Lots of people, but still nice and relaxing place."
Good park for boaters,October 2015,40,Matheson Hammock Park,Grant K,This is mostly a miring park with a small swimming lagoon suitable for small children. There is a nice restaurant with a limited menu at night
Picturesque setting,December 2015,40,Matheson Hammock Park,dizziest1,"Visited right before sunset, there were several engaged couples with their photographers taking photos, so you know it's a beauty. When I was a child and lived in Coral Gables this was a popular place to wade in the cove. Not sure how popular the swimming is now, since we were there in the winter. The pay booth was unattended when we arrived and it was a quiet location, perfect spot to take a walk, run, or bike ride, and enjoy the spectacular views of Miami and the bay. Go, enjoy a natural setting and unwind when you need a respite from the crowded Miami Beach glitz."
Great family park!,February 2016,50,Matheson Hammock Park,RumRunner65,"Beautiful scenery and wildlife, great safe swimming in a lagoon especially for kids, nice grass areas and beach."
Nice family water hole,June 2015,30,Matheson Hammock Park,Erick J,Make sure you get there early so you can settle under the trees and get some shade.

David Cooperfield,November 2015,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,mario v,Jackie Gleason theater has always been a hot spot in Miami. i went to watch david cooperfield perform many years ago and also a few plays more recently. the place has it's years but has been very well maintained and taken care off. on the outside there's nothing to see but the inside matters
Love the venue! And I am a LOCAL!,June 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Ana S,"Great organization, ample room and strong AC! I saw Chelsey HAndler and many local school plays and such"
Cigala concert,October 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,trifi98,security was great
Great venue!,November 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,wheretoadventure,Came here for an invite only concert that we won tickets for.  I loved the old time atmosphere.  Location is great and parking is easy since the convention center is on the same block.  There are pay to park lots and a large parking garage just a two minute walk away.
Best place for concert!,November 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,EduardooSierra,"I went to see Ghost on Nov. 3rd and it was my first time at The Fillmore! Great place with good acoustic and the staff super friendly, looking forward to go to see more artists."
"Incredible Beach for the locals, sometimes has strong smells around",December 2016,40,North Shore Open Space Park,Alexander W,"The locals know this beach is just as good if not better than South Beach.  Parking available, less hassle, and more urban connection to the beach and park.  Little park connected to beach pathways offers a outdoor circuit workout path, and places a bike path to tour on bikes.  Across the street is lots of restaurants, and one/two blocks away on Collins and Washington offers tons of restaurants, shops, drugs stores, etc.  The beach is awesome,  the ocean stays at 1-2 feet for 500 feet out to see.  You can swin to the first sand bar 200 feet into the water, and then stand and the water will be up to your knees.  Nice water, great sand, friendly people, not to crowded, lifeguards all around.   Sometimes there is a little bit of a smell maybe sewage maybe dog poop but it comes from the distance via air.  Since beach always has a little smell (since it is connected to the ocean which is a thriving arena of life and death) it is easy to get used to.  People are nice, had space there everyday including Sat (Dec time period).  And walking around the blocks near the park is super fun too.   Bring beach chairs, towels, sunscreen and it says no drinking but it is not strict and if you are cool and keep it discreet no one will say anything.  Enjoy!!!"
"Overpriced, little value",October 2019,20,Jungle Island,Maria M,"Park was rather small and the price tag did not match. Show was great, petting zoo was disappointing."
Great Atmosphere,February 2017,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Fasfix,"When you don't need the crowds, this is the place to go to.  The open air shopping is very relaxing.  Good for the soul :)  There are places to eat, shop, watch a movie or just take a stroll.  Love this place!  Easy access parking."
Unique,February 2017,40,The Falls Shopping Center,capted1636,"The Falls Mall is a large shopping development built with all businesses facing and surrounding an open air courtyard . The court is a series of waterfalls, pools, fountains and landscaping. There are 90 - 100 businesses, including name retailers, several restaurants and a multiplex theater. Bloomingdale and Maces are the anchor stores. It is a pleasant place to take a stroll in an outdoor setting and away from the hustle and bustle zooming by on the streets just outside of the mall. If you want to shop, there are plenty of takers."
Nice outdoor mall!,February 2017,40,The Falls Shopping Center,n4cedeno,This is a nice outdoor mall. Great to walk around and not congested. The stores are good but not great . The restaurants are pretty good but not exciting.  they are all chain  Restaurants. Definitely visit.
"Great venue, terrible staff ",August 2017,30,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,emilycollins14,"The concert itself was amazing, the artist Khalid performed very well. The staff, however, was very rude. After the concert, I had a friend waiting in a long line to buy shirts. Having an aching back, I just wanted to sit down. In the span of about 20 minutes I was yelled at by 3 different people on the security staff. The 2nd person made me get up from the ground as if I was the reason they couldn't close even though there were at least 50 people in the line. I then waited at the side of the line and was berated by another man who demanded me to leave and when I explained that I had a friend waiting in the line, he insisted that I had to go into the crowded line with her, instead of just waiting near the door. Being in pain, I was already in a bad mood of sorts and these 3 rude people did not make the situation better. "
LAUGHS AND LOSERS,August 2017,10,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,1Trippermonth,"Attended the Bill Maher concert recently and was thoroughly entertained. While the surroundings in this old theater were quite dated, we enjoyed the show. The parking situation was an utter disaster. If you come to the Fillmore for an event, your best bet is to skip the valet parking and find a garage. The system they have is very disorganized and there was a lengthy wait after the show to get your car. All this for $25.00 plus a tip. Here's a tip, find parking elsewhere and probably find another venue to enjoy a concert in Miami. "
Great place after all these years!,August 2017,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,PhilipTurturro,Recently went to see Bill Maher and loved the show. We arrived early and parked on the street about 4 blocks away so parking was no problem. I was pleasantly surprised how well the theater has been kept up. Growing up in south Florida it's nice to visit a place that's still around! We would gladly visit again!
Great theater for music,August 2017,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,bigspyndoc1,"Don't get down to Miami Beach often, but  one of my favorite performers, Donald Fagen (of Steely Dan), was there, his only SoFL stop with his new, young solo band. Easy parking (municipal deck across the street), plenty of food and drink inside the theater--multiple bars. Had very good seats (Row H in the center orchestra) so we had no problem seeing/hearing. Can't speak for seats further back, but the place isn't that big so the sound must be decent throughout the venue. The show was outstanding!"
Dita Von Teese Burlesque Revue,September 2017,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Angelle225,"We attended the Fillmore theater for the Dita Von Teese Art of the Teese Burlesque Revue. Dita was very elegant and true to character and she fit perfectly at this theater. The show was phenomenal. We laughed and we were shocked and we were enthralled. The production, the lights, the sound everything was spot on. I removed a star for a few reasons. The first reason is due to the fact one small bottle of water cost me 6 dollars no questions asked. The second thing that I didn't really like was the seats are close together with no arm rests which makes for uncomfortable seating for two plus hours. The third thing that I didn't care for was parking. Valet parking is 25 dollars no ifs, ands, or buts. We rode to another street and parked in a garage for 1 dollar an hour which makes more sense to me. When you're paying over 200 +dollar for tickets who wants to pay an extra 25 for parking and 6 for a water.  We didn't have any of the concessions but they had several stations of food and alcohol. I wish they had a more healthy option to offer, but alas they didn't at this time. As far as the theater goes the theater itself is beautiful. It's Old Hollywood glam with its red walls and hanging chandeliers. I'd come back here and watch another live show because overall I liked the history of the theater and the beauty of it just heightens and transforms the entire experience! "
"RELAXED, PLENTIY OF BOTH SUN AND SHADE; MOSTLY LOCALS, (NOT TOURISTS)",March 2017,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Travelavel,"The park, which consists of over 30 acres of wooded beachfront, offers a terrific mixture of activities ranging from traditional watersports and beach activities to BBQs, playgrounds, a fitness training course, bicycle/walking paths, and bike rentals.  Restaurants are conveniently nearby the southern boundary of the park at 79th Street and Ocean Terrace or Collins. The park is mostly used by local residents who live nearby (there aren't a lot of hotels in the area), and is sparsely used during workday hours. Convenient municipal surface parking lots are frequently located along Collins Avenue for the entire length of the Park. There are also many public bus stops too. Enjoy this urban nature preserve and the solitude it generally offers!"
You feel very relaxed,May 2017,50,North Shore Open Space Park,marj_SPC,"I loved the ambiance so much! You feel very relaxed with the fresh airs and nice sand, lovely clear water. It's a perfect place for summer. "
Nice venue,June 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Eric B,Attended a concert here and was very pleased with the entire experience. Acoustics were good as well as lighting. No issues with entry or locating our seats. The staff was good and got everyone in efficiently. Lots of bar stations although pricing seemed on the higher end of the spectrum. Food options were decent. I would definitely attend another event at this location.
Excellent,March 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,V0lkster,"The theater is amazing, beautifully decorated, large enough to hold a well sized gathering. Saw Phil Collins in March 2016 with a silent auction and was impressed. Much history and if given a chance to see a concert there it is a must see, with the backdrop of South Beach it is a great location to the area."
"Friendly Staff, Good Theater",April 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,BigPinkBang,"Saw a show there recently. The floor was General Admission. I had a fast pass entry. They were still selling fast passes at the box office on the day of the show. The fast pass line started on the right side of the building. The first door on the right was for the VIP entry. The second door (further down) was the fast pass line. They didn't let us stand by that door until around 4pm because they were setting up the VIP line. We met the manager of the venue who was super nice. They did do a bag check once they open the door. We did not go into the theater right away. We were held in line on a ramp just outside the theater door. They gave us a token as we came through the door. You could trade it in for a free drink (beer, wine, soda or water). You also have a chance to use the restroom. When they finally opened the theater door, the manage walked everyone in slowly through the one door. He lead us down another ramp, but some impatient fans did not follow him and ran to another center entrance. The people at the front of the line following the manager still got to the barricade first."
The Fillmore nowadays,April 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,TourGuide-Manager,"The famous Jackie Gleason Theater, which is now the Fillmore and Miami Beach Convention Center are located just two blocks west.  Artist Roy Lichtenstein’s Mermaid is located on the Fillmore’s lawn.  Along with Andy Warhol, Lichtenstein redefined the way we see art today."
Beautiful Theater !!,July 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Julio G,"we went to the Jackie Gleason as our son's summer camp was having a performance there, WOW its been years since i was there, and no matter which seat you get, you have a great view of the stage, the interior of the theater is beautiful... "
Off the beaten path,May 2017,40,North Shore Open Space Park,MrWarrenM,"North Shore Open Space Park in Miami Beach is a lovely park a bit off the beaten path from the more popular beaches of South Beach, but certainly no less beautiful. True to its name, this is a beach without the concrete and skyscraper skyline that most of the other beaches have. There are picnic tables, trees, a dog park and ample parking."
A HIDDEN GEM!,March 2017,50,North Shore Open Space Park,Travelavel,Thirty (30+) plus acre tree park right on the beach (1/2 long beach) right in the urban heart of Miami Beach!
Very Nice,June 2017,50,The Falls Shopping Center,razz19,"Very nice, clean shopping center! The water features were quite lovely! Every shop imaginable on the property. We only visited a couple to prepare for our cruise out of Miami...Columbia had a great sale on their PFGs! "
very pleasant out door mall which is under cover,June 2017,50,The Falls Shopping Center,madiestan,"very pretty mall, surrounded by very pretty water features that are in the centre, so anyone wanting to just window shop, can sit and wait outside shops but in a very nice location...restaurants and a cinema complex here"
Lovely outdoor mall,July 2017,40,The Falls Shopping Center,Garrett W,"> Make sure you subscribe directly to shop email mailing lists, and any relevant clubs. A good example is Columbia, where they emailed me a 25% off voucher a few days after I joined their VIP club."
Outdoor mall that can be enjoyed in any weather,February 2017,40,The Falls Shopping Center,lotharf1954,"All walkways are covered and you can get from store to store without getting wet even in heavy rain. The mall offers the usual stores that you find in any other mall, but the general atmosphere and landscaping (water falls and fountains...) make this mall somewhat more attractive than most crowded indoor malls. None of the typical food courts to be found there, few restaurants only, did not try any so I cannot judge their quality."
Kool and the Gang Private Concert,April 2018,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Dwane M,"With a group of 300, we rented The Fillmore for a private party featuring Kool and the Gang.  Great venue for food and drink.  We had tables and auditorium seating options.  Sound system is crazy good and great lighting.  We rented the facility on a Monday night.  An over-the-top experience!"
Great place,April 2018,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,worldtravelerz2121,The Fillmore is a terrific place to attend a concert which is the reason we were here.  The nightlines are terrific and there isn't a bad seat in the house! 
Great venue for an intimate concert,June 2018,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Mrs D,"Located in a nice area of Miami Beach. Parking garage within 5 minute walk, Lincoln mall is also a 5 minute walk away."
Concert Venue,June 2018,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,kboom70,A wonderful place to see an intimate concert - the front of the stage is a standing room area and then there are seats behind and upstairs - really not a bad seat in the house! 
Great concert hall for small events,July 2018,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,daigdude,"Great location a few blocks from Lincoln Road, a large municipal parking lot (not to be underestimated in Miami Beach), and reasonably priced concert tickets makes the Fillmore a great venue for small concerts.  Grab a drink and dinner prior to your event, walk a few blocks and enjoy the show."
VERY CHILL AND PEACEFUL!,February 2018,50,North Shore Open Space Park,VP315,"I like this beach because you avoid the madness and crowds of South Beach, a perfect place to come to the beach and just relax! Perfect for families and they have grills you can use to BBQ and whip up a delicious lunch for family and friends!"
Hate this place,October 2015,20,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Krystal R,"Every time I go there is this one security guard to the right who is super rude and doesn't let people pass between acts... even when theres about 40 feet of room in the pit. I normally just go to another person at that point and they let me in but the way he acts is very mean. He can easily say ""no, sorry, can't let you through because I'm not supposed to"" or something similar,  but he says slick comments and gives attitude. Not to mention the lines are huge for everything and the bathrooms are gross."
Great Theater,January 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,citygal2004,HAd a work event at the Jackie gleason theater and was outstanding.  Large venue that is great for shows
Review of the outside,February 2016,10,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,jmparker54,This area is not safe at night.  The homeless flock to this area and there were a few people at the conference I was at nearby that were mugged when walking by.

Iggy Pop's Post Pop Depression Tour,April 2016,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,psuppicich,"The Fillmore Theater is centrally located in South Beach and just a mile from the hotel where we were staying.  When we arrived around 9:00 pm, it was dark out and the building was lit up with lots of neon.  Despite the large number of people arriving at the same time for the show, we were able to enter the theater, go upstairs and find our seats without too much of a hassle.  The theater is attractive inside and the sound was great.  We stood up for the show as did the majority of the audience members.  When the show was over, we calmly streamed out of the theater and moved on to our next destination without much delay."
Ok,August 2018,30,North Shore Open Space Park,MiltonKanno,"I recomend you visit here for short runnings, walk you dog or a very Light walking. Enjoy the beach here is not a Nice  option if you dont have a chair and umbrella, renting is not possible. Not much."
"North beach, Mid beach, South Beach all good.",September 2018,50,North Shore Open Space Park,djack320k,"Miami's north beach (79th) is less crowded, cleaner and offers a community sense. Areas of mid-beach consist of luxury hotels. The beaches in this area of Miami beach are well kept and the water is warm. There are no street shops, or eateries or CVS's on the corner, just a marina for yachts. Many beaches in Millionaires Row are private, access to many beaches are through the hotels. Public access to beaches in this area is limited. The beaches of South Beach are famously known as Miami's Beach tourist attraction for it's art deco architecture, trending shops and eateries. The beaches are publicly accessible and the water is warm. The beaches are crowed according to the seasons, and well maintained. transportation is convenient from the airport to South Beach - you can take the public bus #150 for $2.25 to South Beach. South Beach has 3 free trollies with A,B & C schedules to transport over varies areas of South Beach.."
Overpriced,November 2019,10,Jungle Island,abbe052019,Animals in very small cages. Very overpriced and small. I wouldnt recommend it. The food and drinks are not worth buyinh either.
Lights,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,jolietyler,Enjoyed walking around seeing the beautiful installations. So very very well done. Also enjoyed the bird show. Snacks and drinks are available. Worth the cost of admission.

Luminosa,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,A3510XEchristopherw,"Incredible visual experience for all ages. Definitely worth the visit. Parking on site is a bit expensive ($20), so maybe consider a ride share if you’re close enough. There’s also two acrobatic shows a night that are definitely worth seeing. "
Visit to Luminosa,November 2019,30,Jungle Island,Heather C,"It was a beautiful , but I gave it a 3 instead of a 5 because when my 8 year old got to the section with rock walls and other kids attractions we could not buy him a wristband because they would only take cash. This should have been included or made very clear on website when I purchased the tickets. I had a sad little boy who could only watch other kids having fun. People dont usually carry cash these days. Also feel like parking should be free."
"""Very nice shopping experience""",October 2017,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Stefano B,"The place offers a great different shopping experience as it is an outdoor shopping mall allowing you to come out of the ordinary. A very good shop directory, standard prices and a great environment."
Relaxing mall to stroll and enjoy,December 2017,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Moezfo27,Love to stroll around this open-air mall. Several great restaurants that have indoor and outdoor dining options.

Wonderful day for the kids ,December 2017,50,The Falls Shopping Center,leenylove,"My girlfriend and I decided Surprise our kids and nieces( all girls) for a holiday brunch outing at American girl store. The store is located in the Falls which was a delight to browse the shops, have a wonderful lunch and do some great shopping.

Perfect time of year for The Falls,March 2018,40,The Falls Shopping Center,mwooduk,The Apple store was packed as always and there are other new stores open there too.  Lovely time eating and shopping and walking around looking at the lovely waterfalls etc.

Love this venue but easy on the flashlights.,January 2015,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,864kellis,"I've been here for a concert and now a comedy show. We love this old school smaller venue. More than enough bars so you're never waiting for a cocktail and a great selection of drinks. The downside is the ushers get a little crazy during the shows with their flashlights. I understand the strict rules with recording and pictures but when you're flashing a bright light in a dark room at a person, you're affecting a good 5 to 10 person radius around them and now ruining it for those who obey the cellphone rule. It gets a little out of hand. I was blinded probably three times during an hour and half show for somebody else's ignorance. Cool it ushers. You're acting like a rent a cop."
"Lovingly restored Art Deco building, good acoustics, horrible sight lines",June 2015,20,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,LPSTP,"Recently attended an acoustical concert here. Beautiful restoration of the theater.  Good thing the acoustics in the auditorium were so good, because we sure couldn't see the stage.  Purchased the best seats as soon as they became available, months in advance. Row N. Decent distance from the stage. HOWEVER, the floor in that area was all but flat and with the seating (folding chairs no less) tighter than most airline rows, we were smack up against the people in front of us.  Seats were not staggered so the lady in front of me with the straw hat obscured my view (thank you so much for not removing once you were inside). My husband had a 6'4"" man in front of him.  Wish we had purchased the ""cheap seats"" further back as they were regular theater seats and the rows rose toward the back... much better to actually see what was happening on stage.  Dare I mention the guy two rows ahead of us with the Go-Pro camera videoing each and every song by raising his camera over his head, further blocking the view of everyone behind him?"
What a sham!,March 2015,10,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Arkangil21484,"Don't waste your money buying a ticket to see a show here. My experience was terrible. My favorite comedian Bill Burr was performing here at the Gleason theatre and I jumped at the rare opportunity to finally see him live. While he was great, we paid $50+ per ticket and were sat on the floor level towards the back of the theatre. The mezzanine was above us and so the back half of the theatre is under a roof that is the upper mezzanine level. Thats fine, and they have speakers set in the ceiling part over us, but the speakers were not turned on. We asked them to turn the speakers on because at the back half of the floor seats, the sounds are really lost! TERRIBLE ACOUSTICS!!! I could barely here the comic! Meanwhile, for the ENTIRE show, ushers that looked like they were pulled from the streets were policing audience members one by one for cell phones, using their flashlights to call the attention of audience members sitting in the middle of the rows, so the light would be blinding everybody so they could yell out no cell phones DURING THE PERFORMANCE. Sorry but you're killing the magic when you do that and I will never pay to experience that again and strongly urge you to do the same. It was terrible, how are you going to leave a comedy show feeling pissed off? No. Wrong. Buh bye, Jackie Gleason theatre. I want my money back."
Check out a show,June 2015,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,DrDSM,Great venue to see all kinds of shows. The sound is usually really good and the venue is well kept and always a pleasure to visit. 
It's named the Gleason Theater for a REASON!,September 2015,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Michelle R,Best theater with so much performance history... I truly will lay down on the steps if the City of Miami Beach ever ever tries to tear this theater down.    If your under 30 and don't know who Jackie Gleason is youtube it.  Don't lose sight of GREATNESS
The worst venue ever ,November 2018,10,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,aldom940,Avoid going there

No domestic beer? Are you kidding me?,December 2018,10,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,joecooool,They need to fire The Un-Anerican that made this moronic decision. 
Great Russian Nutcracker,December 2018,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,387indy,"The Fillmore is a beautiful Miami Beach landmark, a very nice venue, a décor that's 1940's. Now, world class Russian artists with Nesting Dolls and Snow Maidens, perform great Russian Nutcracker."
Abysmal Venue - what a shocker!,December 2018,10,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Chantal42,"So whilst I can tell you almost nothing about the ballet performance - apart from not having a live orchestra - I can tell you you that this was the most appalling waste of a half an hour of my family’s life! This includes getting there, parking attendant drama and leaving after 15 minutes!"
Peaceful ,July 2019,40,North Shore Open Space Park,stewcavan60,"This beach is a hidden gem. Hard to find but if you are lucky to find it, you'll have a good time. Plenty of free parking around, less crowded, clean and have a beautiful scenery. "

On the beach ,November 2019,40,North Shore Open Space Park,LollysLook,One of my favorite places to enjoy the water is North Shore beach in Miami. It’s not crowded and it’s a relaxing area to enjoy the day.

The best place for families!,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,m_pastar,"Amazing place for kids of all ages, including parents! Jungle island is so close to other touristic destinations in Miami, don't forget to include it on your list. We visited with family members from Europe, they enjoyed shows, parrots, flamingos and overall tropical vibe. Looking forward to be back!"
Nice!,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,Lucerorr,I visited during the evening to see the Chinese Lantern Festival with my family and friends and it was very beautiful!!
Excellent Presenttation Space,March 2014,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,traveltrackers,It took years to develop the right sound system and the shows are great. Take some time to enjoy their concerts and shows. I remember Gleason introducing Miami Beach to the United States from TV Land.
Valet parking nightmare,March 2014,30,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Corina0909,Park 2 block away for $15
Miami Beach's best venue ,March 2014,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Byzzblarin,"The Fillmore at the Jackie Gleason is the best concert venue in Miami Beach. It has an amazing history as home of the iconic Jackie Gleason show. It is just the right size, has great acoustics, and is comfortable whether you stand in general admission or sit at a table or an assigned seat. They bring in the big names and the rising stars. I've seen many of my favorite bands and solo performers there and have yet to be disappointed. When you visit Miami Beach, see who's performing. You'll leave with a treasured memory. "
Great World Art,January 2015,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,cachid,"Thanks to this theater Miamians can watch great Music from all over the world. Valet parking is very good. Something you want in South Beach. The shows, as I mentioned are fantastic. Acoustics are good, seats are generally good."
The Jackie Gleason Theatre - One Classy South Beach Venue,November 2014,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Peter G,"From the moment one enters the vintage lobby of The Jackie Gleason Theatre, one recognizes this venue represented the class and charm of a bygone era. One cannot help but be stimulated by the color theme and decor - the gilded lilly of the past, preserved for the enjoyment of concert goers today. We first had the pleasure of seeing Janet Jackson in concert a couple years ago. From our mezzanine seating, the sound was excellent and the hall was filled to the brim with an energetic and youthful crowd. The staff were friendly and well-trained, assisting concert-goers to their assigned seats, then expertly expediting us from the venue once the concert ended. We've visited The Jackie Gleason several times since and continue to be impressed not only with the style of the place, but how well this seasoned venue treats its patrons."
Will I go?,November 2019,10,Jungle Island,X8491CIsueh,"Over the past two weeks I have been trying to book the Go Wilder VIP tour. Given the cost, I would have thought it would be a good idea to provide me with the details. I am now wondering if I should spend my money elsewhere as the impression is they don’t really care."
We loved it!!!,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,orlandosoman,"We loved the all the displays and the performances. Live music gave it a person and romantic touch for us. We’ll definitely do it again, and maybe bring the kids. "
Amazing artwork of animals and fishlife on silk with night lighting,November 2019,50,Jungle Island,kchasin,"This is a must-see exhibit for locals or tourists at Miami Jungle.  If u  saw the night garden exhibit at Fairchild Tropical Garden and were amazed by it, then you'll be mesmorized by Luminosa.  The structures of animals and sea-life are exquisite, the work effort is jaw-dropping and the lighting display is inspiring, to say the least.  This exhibit ranks with a Chihully glass show.  We went last Wednesday and purchased discount tickets on Goldstar.  U can watch an acrobat show as well, i thought it was so-so.  I'm writing this review because i read other reviews that were overwhelmingly positive but one that said the exhibit was terrible because the writer saw ""mice"" at an outdoor tropical exhibit with numerous caged animals, ie birds, etc. How silly, what else would u expect to find there?  Note we didn't see one mouse, too bad ... don't miss this, it closes in early January."
Unlike most Shopping Malls,April 2019,50,The Falls Shopping Center,RRaposoMiami,"The Falls in south Miami-Dade is a different shopping experience. Unlike most Malls that are enclosed and air-conditioned, or strip shopping centers that are a parking lot and some store fronts, The Falls offers a unique tropical experience. Most of the store fronts front a lush landscape area with beautiful tropical flowering plants, water features with large rocks, some rushing cascades, wooden cross bridges and covered walkways. It's more like being in Hawaii or Fiji. The Mall features an array of boutiques and mid sized stores and a couple anchors, Macy's & Bloomindales, on each end. You can find everything from an Apple Store, American Girl, to a Gap and Brighton. There's a large movie-plex as well. If you're hungry there are a few theme restaurants both in and around the large parking area, like P.F. Chang, BJ's Brewhouse, Los Ranchos and Brio Italian. Some smaller places for a snack or treat, like Crepe Maker, a Churros spot or Starbucks. There's also a small parking garage. During the Holidays there's aways something for the kids, like the Easter Bunny or Santa. It's especially pleasant during the cooler days of a Miami Winter, or Spring, but if you dress appropriately, even a Summer day isn't all that bad with all the stores, restaurants or movie you can pop into."
Falling Waters,June 2019,40,The Falls Shopping Center,Miriam W,"I watched the construction of this shopping center and must say that I was not disappointed in the tranquil setting of the numerous water falls that the name evoked.  Over the years, the number of waterfalls has diminished to make way for additional sotres but this is still a lovely place for strolling, dining and shopping."
Amazing mall,September 2019,50,The Falls Shopping Center,Frank O,Dedicate 2-3 hours for full enjoyment
Really nice stores,August 2019,50,The Falls Shopping Center,mss F,Great hidden mall in Miami--bookended by Macys and Bloomingdales. Lots of nice stores in between--has covered parking. We found a great store selling columbian jewelry.
Awesomeness,September 2019,50,The Falls Shopping Center,002Erfan,"This shopping center was so amazing. I spent all my life savings here. I bought 83 jackets and 37 pairs of sneakers. I can't afford rent anymore so I'm living in my grandma's house, but I had so many jackets and sneakers. I found out the other day that my grandma threw them out. But I will save up to buy a lot more!"
Great venue,August 2019,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,escapeartiste11,Went to Umphreys Mchgee show at the Fillmore and was impressed how good the sound was.  This place is small enough to appreciate the music. Pricey drinks though!
Excellent Venue. It is big enough to hold enough people but still intimate,November 2019,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,rafaelhernandezm,I went for a concert. The seating was pretty good and the sound was just hitting the spot. I enjoy the layout and sound. Good bartenders and easy to exit. They ran out of valet parking though. Only thing I'd say that wasn't great.
Miami Icon,November 2019,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,browncondo2102,Great venue to watch high-liner shows in Miami Beach.  Contains the iconic Jackie Gleason Theater.  Madonna will be there in early 2020.
Where was she???,November 2019,30,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Billzy7,"Of what was a funny evening of various acts, Dita was the least seen and least interesting person there."
Brit Floyd,May 2014,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Sharyn O,The hall was within walking distance of plenty of hotels.  Drinks were expensive but at any concert you'll find it the same.
Now branded the Fillmore,July 2014,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Tom A,"It was great as a venue, bars everywhere inside the venue, and snacks, as well as a VIP lounge and really good acoustics and sight lines.  Easy to get to from any hotel on South Beach!"
Love this theater,August 2014,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,drporsche,"A true classic. Small intimate and great sound. Saw a Queen tribute concert and the show was great very small crowd. Drinks were a little pricey, but bars were everywhere."
God Save The Queen Tribute Concert,August 2014,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Edmund438,"The lead singer looked enough like Freddie to fill the role.  He sang, danced and acted the park very well.  A must see concert if you are a Queen fan.  Played one night at Miami Beach.  Audience sang, danced and rocked throughout the show."
Tori,August 2014,50,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,Billy R,Saw Tori Amos there. Excellent as always. I believe that I will go there for more concerts. And since I can not submit with out 50 characters or less I will type non sense. Sounds like fishing for compliments. LOL
VALET IS TERRIBLE...venue itself was amazing!,December 2019,40,The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater,G7928JXsarahl,"The theatre alone was excellent, the staff and security were so helpful and friendly. But when it came to valet parking, I wish I caught the name of the company they contract, I recommend you find cheaper parking down the street. We arrived about a half hour before doors opened for the show, handed off our vehicle to valet. Fast forward we left before the last song of the show to beat traffic. We were the first few people outside, handed our ticket to the valet guy and waited. We waited nearly an HOUR for our vehicle in the middle of a rain storm. As the crowd dwindled, hearing numerous people shout “where is my car?” then to have their vehicles come speeding in to the lot, we were the LAST people waiting. We noticed all of the valet employees hanging around their office, walked up to them and asked them what was going on. They didn’t give an excuse and mostly spoke Spanish. To add, giving us dirty looks while speaking to each other. Shortly after, an employee comes speeding with our car to the main entrance. By this time it was almost 1 AM and we were exhausted on our 4 hour drive back to Daytona. Extremely unprofessional. I don’t even know how you forget someone’s car when that is the whole purpose of your job. Save yourself the stress."
Shopping,October 2019,50,Dolphin Mall,astridc2015,Yes love the Dolphin mall 4 shopping i shop a lot good prices and all kind of stores and brand i will be back in a few weeks.

Great stores!,December 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,gilopili,There's also a bowling alley and a movie theater. You can easily spend the whole day there. 
Highly Recommended Shopping Place!,December 2019,40,Dolphin Mall,Brittany1Davis,"Dolphin Mall has tons of things to do, whether you're here for shopping, dining, catching a movie, or bowling with friends. Certainly worth knowing and back again."
I enjoyed this free transportation and had no problems,November 2019,50,Metromover,Kansaskeitho,"Very impressed.  It's a little confusing going to an area toward the center of the system from the far end (like the Financial Center station), as because of the loops in the middle you sometimes don't come back the exact way you went out, but I figured it out, and appreciated Metromover!"
'Overway',October 2019,50,Metromover,MARIO J T,"One of Miami's peculiarities is to have a combination of 2 unusual trains that make an attempt to relieve the city's awful traffic. Miami has the characteristic of having a morning rush hour car caravan to the East where most jobs are and an opposite return home caravan to the West where most residential areas are. This is where the 1st train called Metrorail starts its job. Leaving from the deepest South West suburbs, this elevated rail rapid transit system runs and have stops with parking lots around the whole city and people who hate getting into traffic jams, park their cars and take the train to their jobs mostly in downtown Miami. To complete the system, there is another smaller train called the Metromover that runs along an inner downtown circle near the coast, so it not unusual to see people take the Metrorail and then board the Metromover to get to their destination. Even though you're not going to work, these 2 trains offer any visitor a good, cheap and fast way to get to know beautiful Miami, connect with people and experience something new"
Nice way to visit Down town Miami,November 2019,50,Metromover,180rikak,Nice way to go around Down town Miami. Free Metro in Down town Miami. No driver and you go around and through the buildings. 
Great way to get around,September 2019,50,Metromover,CGA2013,"It’s clean, fast and easy to master. The best way to get around town. Park your car in one place and take the Peoplemover"
Convenient transportation amenity with zero cost,December 2019,50,Metromover,practical22,Sometimes a little crowded but what can you do
Española Way,November 2019,40,Espanola Way,ABullen,"It’s not as big as I thought, only about 5 restaurants, 1 ice cream shop, 2 shops. We ate at Oh Mexico, and OMG the food was amazing!! We almost went back the next day! Service was great too."
great little road...,September 2019,50,Espanola Way,marialopez62,"Nice walk to do in the evening, lot of great vibes and nice restaurants... I particularly love one from some guys from Rome, never knew Roman cuisine can be so delicious."
pretty stroll,November 2019,40,Espanola Way,arizona-mark,lots of restaurants very pretty at night.along this walk with all the lights.  best restaurant is Havana 1957.
Beautiful Atmosphere,November 2019,50,Espanola Way,sueray1789,"You feel like you are in Europe.  Lovely cafes and restaurants in a festive, well decorated street near the beach."
A nice latin alley,October 2019,50,Espanola Way,sandymc2016,"A colourful alley with lights and restaurants, you can have a coctail, a cigar or a tasty meal whatever you like. It is crowdy but feels cozy, more than the bar-restaurants at the South Miami Beach. Worths paying a visit!"
Entertaininh,December 2019,40,Bayside Marketplace,gilopili,"I live in Miami so every time someone comes to visit I take them here. Great restaurants, drinks and atmosphere.  "
Nice but it looks a little run down.,September 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,CGA2013,Too many souvenir stores. Not enough of anything else. A couple of good restaurants. Too many drink stands. A few bars.
Great margaritas/ five guys and hooters,December 2019,40,Bayside Marketplace,ActuallyKillian,"For us, we grabbed cured our hangovers with five guys topped off with a margarita. "
"Multitude shops selling a lot of junk, picturesque.",December 2019,40,Bayside Marketplace,Elga K,"There are many shops here, selling all sorts of junk. There are picturesque walks outside with lovely views over the bay. Handy location to start tours, eg. with the Big Bus Company."
really interesting walk through / stores most cannot afford,November 2019,40,Miami Design District,scott r,"Came to see two contempary art museums and ended up spending an hour or two walking through the DD.  Parking is impossible on the street, but garages are cheap ($3 for 4 hours).  Neat place to wander - hard to believe it was once basically blight.  At the moment I'm on a budget, but even if I hadn't been, the clothing / fashion stores would not be on my list.  Fun to see, but it's clothing for g-d's sake; jeans should last 15 years and sneakers for 5, lol.  The art on the other hand, might have tempted me; just not this time.  Lots of visual interest though, touches of whimsy - and plenty of food.  A neat area for an afternoon."
Awesome Area,November 2019,50,Miami Design District,Lino D,Many may view the area as solely for those who can indulge in luxuries.  I view it as Commerce as Art and very much worth the visit.
A Miami Interior Design & Architectural Must See During The Day,September 2019,50,Miami Design District,PSthisRocks,The Miami Design District is a must-see location. It's been recently renovated with luxury stores that have some of the best designs in the world. Be sure to go in Gucci and look for the parking garage. Make time to walk around to explore too.

Miami Botanical Garden is a nice green Oasis in Miami Beach.,July 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,monicabjorkhaug,"In here you can se some animals around the park. But most plants and flowers, is a quiet place to relax and have a silent time with your self or family/friends. "
Short Walk from Lincoln Drive  - a different side of South Beach,October 2019,40,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,NA N,As a native of Miami/Miami Beach I was surprised to see signs for a botanical garden so close to home. It was a wonderful place to sit and have a quiet lunch or just relax from the sun and noise of South Beach.
I loved it!,June 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Loren D,This is a true gem for all who are into botanics. Must see location if youre visiting Miami Beach. Iam coming back!
Loveliness,December 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Gettiredtraveling,"I finally got to the Botanical Garden after learning about it on a previous Miami Beach stay. I like that there was no entry charge and its size is manageable for a brief visit. It's very peaceful and a wonderful respite from the building density and busy roads of the surrounding area. We especially enjoyed seeing the butterflies and the giant milkweed plant. It was delightful meeting garden staff, Gaylord and Michael, and loved their knowledge about the garden. Next time I hope to take the Saturday morning tour."
Little spot of paradise,December 2019,50,Miami Beach Botanical Garden,Cherith_CB,Escape the crowds of South Beach and enjoy a spot of paradise.
Was a bit unwhelming...,November 2019,30,Little Havana,mgmgmgmg2015,Travelled to little Havana as part of our visit to Miami. Was left a bit disappointed as it was only a small area with several cigar shops and restaurants. Not much else to see. Would probably only spend 30 min here at the most
So so,November 2019,30,Little Havana,sndovale,We were not impressed with this area mostly designed as a tourist attraction. We were on our way to Havana so we didn't eat here or buy anything.
Little Havana ,November 2019,40,Little Havana,LollysLook,"We did a self guided tasting tour of Little Havana. We are our way through the area with stops for drinks, lunch  and finished with cafe and pastries. "
Nice place to have a meal,December 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,Graham V,It is where the big bus changes from blue route to red route. We had a quick look around our first day and the next day after doing a boat trip we browsed the many shops and restaurants. Where we had our evening meal there which was reasonably priced
Pretty Typical ,December 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,hollyk28,"We spent a few nice hours here, touring the outer edges of the market, looking at the bay, the boats, the cruise ships, the birds and the manatees.   Inside is pretty typical middle-America mall stuff, but the walk to and fro,  and the open-air aspect on such a nice day,  made it most enjoyable.   The Starbucks there was delightful with lovely staff and great drinks."
Great shops,December 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,michael m,What a wonderful surprise. stayed across the street what an easy walk. great shops and food. right on the water. loved it

Fun location,November 2019,50,Little Havana,jmyv,"Lots of shops selling artistry from locals.  Very nice jewelry, artwork, etc.  You can watch men roll cigars and there are several cigar shops.  Lots of places to choose to eat, incluing many bars that sell mojitos with a piece of sugarcane in it as a stirrer.  Really good!  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"
love it,November 2019,50,Miami Trolley,MariannVdL,"it's free, and there are few circuits. some times you have to wait a little bit, but you can go all the collins Ave go and back."
Free trolley ride,December 2019,50,Miami Trolley,lewismd30,Here in Miami Beach but not near the Art Deco district. Free trolley ride all day and takes about 15 minutes from Eden Roc hotel with the stop outside the Hotel to Lincoln Road. Drivers are great but especially Donna who had a crowd last night with traffic problems. Easy to get around on.
Lots of Animation shops and restaurants. recommended !,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,180rikak,"Very nice place near the Marina. lots of restaurants, shops and music. recommended to visit during the day or in the evening. central place to start your visit by bus or by boat."

Best free way for travel in Miami Beach,December 2019,50,Miami Trolley,Noncsim,"It’s a relly good way for free to go around Miami Beach. There are more lines so you can reach every famous places from North to South. Get the app and you can see where is your trolley. The best driver is Donna on Collins Express, she’s a real nice entertainer, not just drive, do a sightseeing tour if you travel with her"
Convenient but not reliable time-wise,November 2019,40,Miami Trolley,Elga K,"We travelled from the cruise port to Vizcaya on this free trolley. There is even a sign saying ""gratuities not allowed"". So, very convenient but there could be a long wait, then two or more trolleys come at once. It is used a lot by locals, most Spanish-speaking. Wooden seats, not padded."

Pure Joy,October 2019,50,Britto Central,nomari2015,My daughter has been a fan and wanted to come here for five years.  It is WELL worth the uber ride to come over and see the gallery. His story is inspirational to anyone- especially artists. (And their mothers.)

I LOVE Britto,November 2019,50,Britto Central,Jetscot,I have been a big fan of Romero Britto for years. I started my collection on a Royal Caribbean ship and bought ‘The Royal Bear’. I have lots of small pieces now and have been a few times to Britto Central on Lincoln Road. I still get excited to visit. I am now the proud owner of two of his prints. The first I carried (framed) all the way on two flights back to Scotland and on our last visit my husband bought me ‘The Hug’ which was just too big to carry home so we brought back the print. My ambition is to meet Romero in person.

Really nice beach but be aware of recent sewer situation ,August 2019,40,Bal Harbour Beach,Jackfish28,"This is a really nice scenic beach, with several hotels like the Ritz and St Regis as well as a lot of upscale condos. The bay flows out and in from the Atlantic right by the Ritz. When we were there last week this section of the beach and right across on handover beach was closed due to massive sewer spill at another park on the bay. They claimed to have it fixed but beach was still closed Sunday and when we were tarpon fishing in canals across from Bal Harbour Saturday night we definitely got a whiff of a fresh sewage spill "

The docent did a great job with giving a brief history of the museum, of the founder and some of the various pieces. It is only a 45-minute guided tour. I found it not only educational, but interesting. The building itself is historic and worth seeing. "
"Phenomenal! For Art Deco lovers...and those who are curious, open-minded, appreciate art, design, history, culture.",November 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,HeatherWilde11,"The Wolfsonian is not to be believed. One man’s eye, intellect, commitment  to explore, preserve, explain, share art and artifacts of mostly the 20th century. Social and art history that is beyond extraordinary. My new wish is to meet the man who created and assembled this collection. OMG...mind blowing. And one particular painting that brought tears. (I wasn’t allowed to photograph that painting...alas.)"
Shopping,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,drmichaeldbruce,Great location food music and shopping what can I say people are great I went around 9pm just after checking in the hotel after my flight it was a nice spot and food was good 
"Shopping, eating and a view!",November 2019,40,Bayside Marketplace,Stephen A,"Yes, there are shops that you can see anywhere but there some nice local shops with fun things to buy. Local clothing, jewelry, and art. The Hard Rock Cafe is there along with other big names like Hooters and Bubba Gump. It is outdoors with lots of places for shade and drinks to listen to music. Overall, a nice place."
Meh - if you like the bus tour vibe.....,November 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,scott r,"Shopping experience paying homage to Pete Seeger's song 'Little Boxes' - ticky-tacky.  Adjacent to Bayfront Park - the park itself is nice.  As well as a parking garage that wanted $20 flat fee - really??  If you're stuck in a hotel nearby and afraid to go out into the city, maybe.  You're with a crowd of teens or just want to act like one - overexcited, loud and 'dying for a drink', sure.  Otherwise, skip."
Great place,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,Elizab4321,"Love Bayside, this is a great place to spend your day. Take a boat trip, speed boat , or pleasure boat, lots of shops to browse. And loads of really good restaurants to eat in, or just take a drink,and enjoy the place."
very cool museum,July 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,jelico8,"I definitely recommend this museum. We did it in about an hour, but there are a few short films that we didn't watch completely and they would add time to your visit."
Sociological Judaism,April 2019,40,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,JohnfromRI1234,"3) The museum is understandably focused on Miami Beach.  But aside from an excellent timeline near the entrance, there's almost nothing on Jews in Florida outside of the Miami area.  It could be called the Jewish Museum of Miami."
Great walking tour,May 2019,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,broadwaybaby30,We just did the Jewish Walking Tour of Miami Beach with Howard and had a great time. We learned a lot about Jewish history in Miami Beach and really enjoyed seeing the different architectural building styles. I highly recommend this tour for anyone who is interested in Jewish history in Miami Beach. 
ENTERTAINING AND INFORMATIVE,May 2019,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,J6958RTjays,"The museum located in Downtown Miami Beach. It is an Old Synagogue in Miami Beach. It tells the story of the Jewish People in the State of Florida. It talks about everything from RESTRICTED DEEDS, NOT ALLOWING JEWS TO RENT, OR BUY PROPERTY to how the community came about."
Highly recommended!,May 2019,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,YahmR1,"I visited the museum with my partner for the first time and had a wonderful walking tour. It was very informative and interesting. Plus the museum had several great exhibits so that was fun as well. If you've got the time and want to learn about local Jewish history, I would definitely recommend visiting!"
Shopping,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,CatsiMari,Long indoor and outdoor shopping plaza with many restaurants on the water. There is live music and lots of bars. There is an option to go on a big pirate ship. I was met with a lot of friendly people there and I recommend going here for a day trip!
"Very, very worthwhile",November 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,scott r,"Came on this by accident - walking tour met in the building; I had not knowledge of the place.  Wow - what a treat.  Give yourself at least two hours; three would be better.  Encompassing a wide range of deco and streamline modern objects, appliances, furniture, posters, artifacts, etc., you really want to try and get inside the mind of the man behind all this.  I left at closing without time to chat up the gift store people who might have provided a clue, but the exhibits themselves are top notch.  Not crowded at all, plenty of time for photos - a few marred by glass cases obscuring what might otherwise have been left on full view, but then I suppose that creates security problems or high cost for smaller items.  Still a great collection, and a much better sampling than you find in major museums that just don't focus on this era."
A Gem,December 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Frank-in-SF,"I really had to laugh at the reviews that said how they ""didn't get it.""  If they expected to see Old Masters paintings, they should try the Met, because they definitely came to the wrong place."
"Small intimate museum, great find.",December 2019,50,The Wolfsonian - Florida International University,Tim J,"You always need to check out local museums when on vacation. You can get through this museum in an hour if you are quick. Great eclectic exhibits. There are 5 levels to walk through. The Hitler/nazi exhibit was very disturbing but interesting, then you have a whole level of cartoons. Everyone needs to spend time to expand their knowledge."

Excellent historical walking tour ,February 2019,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,yorkieg3,Part of the museum was closed for repair. The video presentation in the museum was very good and worthwhile. I’d give the museum 4 stars but the walking tour deserves 5. 
This was a delightful museum,September 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,DiamondHiltonMember,Surprising the amount of fascinating information found here. I am not Jewish and found this educational and beautiful. The place is full of history most know nothing about. A real hidden treasure. A strong salute to the LBGT community as well
Take the historical walking tour of Miami Beach after visiting the museum,February 2019,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,bee k,"Spent part of our day visiting this historic former synagogue and learning about the Jewish history of Miami Beach.  We watched a video presentation, viewed the artifacts and pictures, and went on an excellent walking tour of the area learning about the people, their stories, and the architecture of the time.  Delightful presentation by our guide Howard who can answer all your questions.  Allow yourself at least an hour and a half for the walking tour itself.  The museum is self-guided and takes about 45 minutes."
More interesting if you’re Jewish! ,February 2019,30,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,sbizzle,"I was in and out in 20 minutes, just before one of the many coach parties descended. "
Beautiful island but not public,June 2019,30,Fisher Island,Mdefil23,This place is beautiful. It's a real escape but the challenging part is finding a way to get access to it.
Bring Your Black Card!,May 2019,50,Fisher Island,Miriam W,"Construction of Fisher Island began in 1919 when Carl G. Fisher, a land developer, purchased the property from businessman and real estate developer Dana A. Dorsey, southern Florida's first African-American millionaire.  It is the land of the rich and famous and the rich and anonymous.  The price to live here is beyond the grasp of most, however, the hotel is within budget with your Black Card.  Accessible only by ferry boat, it is an amazing place to  experience!"
little heaven,September 2019,30,Fisher Island,marialopez62,"Used to live there, I enjoyed how close to everything you can be but at the same time far away from traffic and noise. A little paradise in the middle of the city."
Very knowledgeable tour guide. Loved all the interactions with the animals!! Great place.,November 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,Hell2324,"A group of friends, myself and two children went on a Sunday. We had a blast! We are definitely animal lovers and getting to pet the monkeys/ baby lion and other various animals was a life long dream! Thank you all for your knowledge and friendliness."
Great experience worth the money!,November 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,schmaylaa,"What an incredible experience! Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and accommodating to everyone. The tour was above and beyond what I expected, we were able to get so close to the animals. The interactive portion was perfect for our family. My step-daughter overcame her fear and touched a snake, seeing monkeys climb on my husbands head was hilarious and being able to touch a lion cub was a dream of mine since being a small child. I will definitely be going back for the feline encounter at some point."
Animal Encounters,November 2019,50,Zoological Wildlife Foundation,231candacet,The guides were knowledgeable and personable. The special wildlife encounter with all of the cubs and monkeys was well worth the money. The quaintness of the facility is perfect size for the animal interactions. I will definitely be a return customer.
"Neat outdoor mall, but not for me",November 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,AG982,Neat outdoor mall with tons of shops and music. The sales clerks were friendly but pushy. The music was very nice - live music playing in the center of the mall.

Best food court ever,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,ABEKYT,Food court has varieties of buffet and line up restaurant and bars has plenty of cuisines from around the globe. Annoying tour package sellers though. 
Huge market with a Caribbean and cuban ambiance.,December 2018,40,Bayside Marketplace,staajabuatravel,"The market is filled with souvenir shops, restaurants, boats and yachts. It's a good spot to visit when in Miami. So many tourists. It's a good place to hangout. The 45 minutes thriller speedboat ride is WOOOOW!"
Jewish walking tour,January 2019,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,bhlaw,"The walking tour starts inside the museum, which always has excellent art shows in addition to history of Florida Jews who settled in Miami Beach, and walks about a 10 block rectangle indicating the background of particular buildings and the history of the Jews who developed them. Howard is a remarkable guide, concise and informative, with an excellent speaking style. He also brings copies of photos of the old timers who founded south beach and the original buildings that still stand today. Did you know the world famous restaurant joes stone crab was founded by joe Weiss and his wife? Or that Miami Beach wasn’t even incorporated until 1915 and at its height in the 1960’s Jews constituted over 60% of the population? We learned so much on the walking tour and at the museum. A definite must while in south beach."
Fabulous walking tour of Jewish Miami!,December 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,ElyceGtravels,"I highly recommend doing this walking tour! What a wonderful way to spend a Sunday morning. Howard's in-depth knowledge, love of history and friendly personality made for a great experience of walking back in time to learn how Jewish involvement in Miami evolved over the decades. A highlight of our trip!"
Well Worth the Time,December 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,sleppysr,"Not being a local, or even  Floridian, I wasn’t sure what to expect when my wife and I visited.  But my grandparents were snowbirds for more than a few years back in the day and so I was curious.  We spent several very interesting hours first with a great guided tour and then on our own.  The staff were friendly and informative and the displays beautifully organized.  Thanks to the folks that helped to memorialize the growth of a vital and vibrant Jewish presence!"
An insight into discrimination,January 2019,40,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,John R K,My sparse knowledge of Jews in FLorida propelled me to give the museum a go.   The film is a must see as it provides a good history of the discrimination of jews in Florida and highlights their influence on the state's development
Definitely worth a visit ,January 2019,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,T L,This was a fantastic museum.  We had a guide named Linda who was so knowledgeable about all the exhibits.  She made it a wonderful experience with interesting stories of the extraordinary families that contributed to building of Miami.  It would not be the Miami of today without the investment and hard work of the Jewish immigrants who came to this land for a better future.   Strongly recommend that you take some time to visit this museum.  It will give you a better appreciation of Miami for sure!
Cruse tour,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,Spoiledmother40,I enjoyed my boat ride with nonstop laughs the crew member was so funny and made sure everyone was able to get good pictures

Huge exhibit,December 2019,50,Art Basel,pmoeser,"This show is stunning. It is too large to cover in one day. The vibe is international with galleries from all over the world and all sorts of modern art from sculpture to painting to film, etc. It is amazing to see what creative minds can produce."
Full spectrum art exhibit,December 2019,50,Art Basel,dstrick,"Finally, scheduled to attend this festival after hearing about it for many years. I’m very happy I made it happen. I attended the Context and Spectrum shows on separate days. The vastness of the exhibits, and the fact that they are spread out across the city is impressive. It’s overwhelming in a good way. If you up to a lot of walking, you are in for a treat. I enjoyed speaking with the artists, and taking in some very interesting pieces. I also, spent a night enjoying some of many block parties occurring throughout the city. It was nice to see both locals and international folks really enjoying this event. I will definitely try to attend in future years."
Art Overload,December 2019,50,Art Basel,EspBing,"I overloaded on art in and around the convention center.  Lots of traffic around the area, too, which sucks!  But once you get in, the art will calm you down."
Be Sure Not to Miss the Experience ...,December 2019,40,Art Basel,Monalisa43,"This is a must do experience, most especially if you appreciate art and partying with artist ! I most especially enjoyed SCOPE and the PAMM. It’s simply an amazing time to be in Miami !!! "
Beautiful Stores & Restaurants on Biscayne Bay,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,Maria M,"If you're looking for a beautiful seaside setting to shop and eat and listen to live music, this is the place to be in Miami.  It is touristic but locals go too.  You will also have an array of waterway tours to pick from to see Miami from the water.  I suggest the jet boats. Only slight drawback is that parking is a little expensive."
One of the best part of Miami.,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,flavioandras,"Bayside Marketplace is an excellent place who wants to buy souvenir, clothes, or even Coconut drink! The place has a good vibe too. Most of the Boat Tours are depart from there. If you have some hours in Miami, definitely go there."
The heart of Miami lives in Bayside,October 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,Linda G,"No trip to Miami would be complete without a visit to Bayside Marketplace ~ The people, The music, The food all come to life here along its walkways and along its amazing water views!

Port worthy,November 2019,40,Bayside Marketplace,213stacyt,"This is a great spot to spend the day.  It has everything you could want, shopping, restaurants and bars.  This little port offers boat rides around the port and even to the Bahamas.  "
Amazing Walking Tour!,October 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,unknownshenronz,We went on a walking tour at the Jewish Museum of Florida on Thurs 10/25 led by Howard. It was so much fun and so informative! It was our first day of our trip to Miami Beach and it was great to walk around and get to know the neighborhood a bit better while learning so much about Jewish history. Howard is incredibly knowledgeable and has curated a comprehensive tour with historic images that correlate to each landmark. We got to explore the museum as well and visit the gift shop which has many beautiful things.
Outstanding Visit,October 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,Nanci R,"Not only standing in an actual 1929 building with such a rich history was a remarkable experience, but the overall atmosphere made our outing even more relevant when a FIU docent volunteer so graciously walked us through the exhibits.

A great time to visit Miami,December 2019,50,Art Basel,Ryan L,There is more art than one person can see.  Multiple venues all around the city.  Scope is my favorite because you can see newer artists at more reasonable prices if you are looking to buy.

My monthly trip to Bayside,November 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,Scott K,"I live right across the street and I normally walk over about once a month. While the place needs to be updated a bit, it is a great neighborhood shopping place. Good food, nice atmosphere, with fishing and pleasure boats to take a ride on if you want to.

You can then walk to Bayfront Park...the area is very nice and safe."

The guide who runs the tours was absolutely great.  So knowledgeable both about the history of the Jews of Miami and also the architecture of South Beach.  We had a great time, learn't a lot and had a few surprises along the way about jewish Miami/Florida history.  You also get Museum entry with the ticket and there is a really good permanent exhibition there and some good visiting exhibitions.  I would really recommend the walking tour and the museum in general."
Suberb and unique tour,June 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,BKMIA,"Our family was lucky enough to have Howard, as our guide. He was so knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. We spent a lovely Sunday afternoon with him, the food was great and the tour was even better. We loved learning about all the Jewish history in our own backyard that you couldn't read in a textbook. Such a pleasure to see the roots of Miami Beach by walking in front of it. Highly recommend this to everyone of all ages. Its truly a unique view of South Beach. The museum is also lovely, and worth a few hours of your time."

Beautiful setting but OK shops.  Don't make a special trip!,November 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,yota7,"Shopping wise way over hyped!  Usual beach ocean mall.  Spread out.  Clean with nice views and restaurants.  Most people were getting boats, tourists or picking up tours.  Beautiful setting and views.  Clean.  Quite quiet.  Do not make a special trip otherwise.  Free wifi did not work.  You get the infrequent 120 bus from South Beach or a taxi."
Excellent place to take your girlfriend to walk,April 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,nicolasc748,"Good restaurants and a nice view of the Miami Bayside. Many hotels are just few steps ahead, as well as many stores for shopping."
Busy touristy but fun,October 2019,40,Bayside Marketplace,watersoul6,This is a different type of mall with embroidery and 3d pictures it is geared at the gift and tourist market. Its less geared towards “real” clothing and more the novelty market but that makes it a fun change from the other malls which are all the same. 
Beautiful synagogue,February 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,John W,This free attraction is a real gem. We spent an hour looking at the displays and liked the special exhibitions about Torah pointers and art works. There is a shop and small cafe. Friendly volunteers.

Fantastic place to learn about the role  and impact of Miami's Jewish Community,March 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,Bradley R,"We had a wonderful visit to the Museum and on arrival were told that we would have a guide to take us round the exhibits. Jorge brought the whole place to life and punctuated the tour with fascinating insights and stories based on some of his own, and others experiences. The exhibits were well laid out and informative and the buildings - 2 ex-synagogues were superb with amazing stained glass windows (one donated by Meyer Lansky who used to be a member) and original art deco light fittings. This is a must visit attraction. A few days later we went on a walking tour led by Howard, of jewish Miami Beach. Howard did a great job and made it a really enjoyable tour which lasted about 2 hours."
Jewish walking tour,March 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,Elise H,We had an absolutely amazing tour with Howard Mayer. He knew so much about Miami Beach’s connection to the Jewish community that started there up to today’s latest restraunteurs and real estate moguls. He was also very knowledgeable in the Art Deco architecture and filled us in on little details about this. It was fun being a tourist in my own home town. Now I love Miami Beach even more!!!
Colony Theater review,June 2017,40,Colony Theatre,asedrickt,The Colony theater is a beautiful facility where I was able to watch several movie screenings. I was impressed by the comfortable seating and sound quality of the theater. Definitely worth a visit.
"Overrated, very expensive beer, nice view",October 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,Riplis,"However, I do recommend the speed boat trip outside of the Miami coast line. it departs from bayside marketplace. Tickets can be bought online or on site."
"Shopping and food, not much else",October 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,martymar1970,"As a native of Baltimore, this place reminded me of Harborplace.  Shopping and restaurants, with some boat tours and that's about it.  Nothing here you can't find at any mall or open air shopping center.  Location is good."

A good history of the Jews in Miami.,January 2018,40,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,Pages-Daddy,The guide was very knowledgeable and took time to explain to several non-Jewish visitors about the symbolism of Jewish house of worship.

Don't forget who made the beach,January 2016,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,JohnK329,The title of this review is their motto and I love it.  Rarely have I found a more welcoming and relaxed community.  I am a newcomer to town and have already made a few friends from the congregation.  Love the down home and straightforward sermons.
Amateur hour,March 2014,20,Colony Theatre,ABClady,"Most of the shows we have seen here have been like an Amateur Hour performance, low budget and low talent.  A French revue had 4 or 5 performers of dubitable quality.  An opera performance featured a motley chorus that was mostly offkey.  Of course, it's inexpensive, so I guess you get what you pay for."
We had a blast!,August 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,FloridaMG,You can make reservations on line or at the ticket window.  The price of the Encounter includes the park entrance.  It is all well worth it.  A thrilling experience and a lot of fun.  A memory to last for many years.
"Great location, not so great everything else.",October 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,Lynn K,"If you are on the HOHO buses this is a close location for a quick bite to eat with a beautiful view.  Other than that, not worth making a special stop."
Chili's,October 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,JBeck85,"We had a great time, our waitress was excellent and the food was great. We had so many drinks that I lost count and the bill was still reasonable."
Great Shopping,October 2019,50,Bayside Marketplace,CandyVhorst,"Great located, plenty of good options for shopping, open until late, variety of restaurants being one indoor brazilian upstairs amazing and at a worthy price. Perfect to spend all day here between walking, eating, drinking and shopping!"
"Not much there, park outside of the market",October 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,Alan H,"For the most part this is shopping with places to eat.  Nothing special about the shopping, we did eat there and it was good, nothing to make you return.  This is the location for numerous boat sight seeing tours.  You will pay to park, in the market garage it is $20 for 2 hours, at the city lots on the street $10 for 2 hours. Unless your taking a harbor boat tour skip it."
Great views but terrible restaurants and shops,September 2019,30,Bayside Marketplace,lucineia2016,"If you come to Miami, I suppose you should go to Bayside marketplace.  Nice views of the bay, marina and port. However, the buildings are old and dirty.  Restaurants are very poor, drinks are watered down, foodcourt is dingy, shops are old and crappy.  If not for the views, I would give it a one star rating.  This is also the place to catch the hop on hop off buses and there are nice boat tours of the bay. City of Miami needs to close this down and upgrade everything"
"Dirty,abandoned place.Settings are in horrible state",August 2019,10,Miami Seaquarium,daliad755,In the following photos you can see the dirt
Walking Tour of South Beach,January 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,tinacove,"Starting inside the two beautifully preserved synagogues, we joined our knowledgeable guide Howard for the walking tour of South Beach. Howard definitely arrived prepared with historical photos and interesting facts spanning the development of this portion of South Beach.  Loved his presentation which included the 3 A's propelling the development of the area, people involved, buildings and of course, the color palettes that visually brought national attention to the Art Deco district. *If interested, he also offers this tour incorporating food."
"Interesting place, knowledgeable staff",December 2017,40,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,ElenaTraveler,"The reason I gave 4 stars is that the demo of the MONAD Studio 3D-printed objects, which is supposed to be music, was quite loud and disturbing at times, playing something one doubtedly calls music."
Small but mighty,November 2017,30,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,aliceann1,"In the permanent exhibit space, The Jewish Museum of Florida addresses the arrival of Jews to the state of Forida, primarily. It is presented in chronological order and helps to demonstrate the variety of reasons that they came to the state and the variety of backgrounds, as well. There is a fun ""scavenger hunt"" for children to complete and a prize for them upon completion.  It is not a particularly interactive Museum--lots to read and lots to see though.  Several artifacts related to Jewish holidays and traditions are present. There is a temporary exhibit space and appears to present items of interest that go beyond Florida. This is a rather small space. If you're a fast reader, you'll be done in an hour or so. You will have more interest in the subject matter if you are from Florida. But, nonetheless, it is an interesting venue for those with an interest in Judaica.  Nice little gift shop offers a variety of items."
Katryna is the best!!!,February 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,nicksellsmiami,"Visited last Sunday, service was excellent. Katryna absolutely murdered it. Best spot to hang out ever!!"
Not at all what was advertised!!,May 2018,10,Safari Edventure,wendymiller3970,"When we arrived we really thought it was someone's house that was just fenced off with lots of overgrown vegetation! No parking lot, you just pull off the sides of the road! Keeping open minds we still were excited and wanted to experience the park after reading all the things to do at this park. The admissions office is literally a delopitated shed, ok still trying to be positive! Before purchasing our tickets we started asking about all the hands on experiences that they advertise and guess what, for various excuses not one of them was available!! Oh but we could still pay full price and go in, ummm no thank you!! Dont do it!!"
Average a fun show (5) with poor service (1) for 3 stars,December 2011,30,Colony Theatre,Kimberly B,"Someone (NOT Ticketmaster) lost my PAID ""will call"" order. If I hadn't brought my receipt, who knows whether they would have let me in!  As it was, I had to do some firm talking. Each live show may be handled on a case by case basis, so don't let that deter you. The actual show (Shlomo,The Soul Doctor) was so much fun!  The facility was comfortable and I liked the Art Deco styling. The theater is right on the Lincoln pedestrian mall, which is convenient for making an evening of it."
Extraordinary venue,December 2011,50,Colony Theatre,Andreja V,"One of the rare places in Miami dedicated to non commercial, artistic and simply good shows. They also hold few festivals every year."
I don't want you to know about this place,February 2012,50,Colony Theatre,abst14,I love going to shows here and having great seats for good prices. I want to support the Colony but don't want more people to go because it's so special. 
Day excursion,July 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,sandrabD7625QQ,It was ok. The orca and dolphin show was great. The manatees were interesting and they had a great group of parrots. 
Good for young kids,July 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,laurie705,Good day at the Seaquarium - they are mostly about conservation and rescue so the shows aren't very exciting if you've been to Sea World.  Great military discount.  The sea lion show was the best of all the shows during the day.
Swim or Sink with the Dolphins?,July 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,jlioakmont,For years swimming with the dolphins was on my bucket list. As a surprise for our grandsons I decided to book a swim. At $240 a head plus a mark up for my husband and son in law to watch it cost over $900. A bit steep but was willing to pay for the experience. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up when they told me we were going to do 'picture time'. Part of the 'experience' is wasted on them taking pictures to sell you at outrageous prices. And when I asked if my husband could stand behind us to get the pictures on our phone he was denied. For the price of $240 a head they should give you a free picture or allow your family member the same access to take your picture. Or get rid of the photographer completely. That is not why I was there. Ruined my experience.
Awesome Experience,July 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,patrick s,What an amazing family experience during our visit to Miami from New Jersey! We enjoyed all the wildlife and shows! Grecia Z was an amazing staff member and went above and beyond to explain about the history of the park and how to navigate through the parks and shows! Thank you Grecia Z!
Dolphin Encounter/ Waste of Money,July 2019,10,Miami Seaquarium,kimandmike302,"Took our big group with kids who were very excited to swim with dolphins. Not at  all what we expected. Rushed through our experience. Our trainer was not very friendly. Kids were disappointed. At one point during her ride on the dolphin,  one of the young girls was told  that if she if didn't get it right this time she wouldn't get to go at all! REALLY? That is why we came and what we paid for. I thought she might cry. I was able to talk her through it since her Mom was already at the other end. Unacceptable to talk to children like that. Help them figure it out. That is your job. My other problem with this encounter is that we didn't get to see our dolphins do any tricks like jump, wave, dance or anything. We got photos kissing and holding it's fin. Then swimming with it. Then while we looking at photos, I happened to look out and watch the group after us, and they were getting what seemed like to me the whole experience. The dolphins were interacting with them by jumping in the air, dancing, waving and splashing them. Wow what a total different encounter! Wish ours was like that. Our kids may have enjoyed it more. I feel like I wasted my money! Then I get inside to be gouged on photos. What a joke. I guess the worst part is when I asked to speak to a supervisor only to be told there wasn't one available? Huh? Ok that is weird. I did talk to someone who gave me a manager's email. Not sure what good that will do. I feel like you need to work on your whole dolphin encounter and your customer service. We had a group of 7. So we spent a lot of money to be disappointed. My daughter and I have done this before in Grand Cayman,  and it was superb compared to yours. I personally would never recommend this to anyone. "
South Beach Jewish Walking/ Food Tour,November 2017,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,4100galt,I would recommend the varied tours run through the Jewish Museum.  Both the young teens and the grandparents had a great time. 
FLORIDA JEWISH HISTORY,November 2017,40,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,308ronaldc,An excellent walk through the history of Jews and their influence on the growth of Florida. A  very worthwhile trip to South Beach.

Awesome experience,December 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,ami_miami22,"Wharf has the best environment and hands down best service. I love it here! Great drinks awesome music and the coolest people come by here. I've always had a good time at this bar, and enjoyed the cocktails. But Hector was an awesome bartender that was really engaging and definitely made my night. Thank you!"
Very Trendy Spot that's Friendly to Kids,January 2019,40,The Wharf Miami,RoseMeghan,"It's a really cool place, but parking was difficult to find. But once you go there it's really a trendy little spot that you can take very instagram-worthy photos. Once I entered the guy there told me that kids can stay until 6; after that it's adults only. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful time, though my kids got a little bored because the table tennis tables were occupied as were the other lawn games. The food is delicious (albeit a little pricey) and they offer a good variety of food and drinks."
Fun & Educational ,July 2017,40,Safari Edventure,beachbum7903,"This is one of our favorite rehab/rescue in South Florida.  They provide a sanctuary for the animals, many of whom cannot be released back into the wild after rehabilitation.  Very clean. They are working on building larger habitats. The educational presentation is always a must see. "
You can't hug a kangaroo anymore ,October 2017,40,Safari Edventure,Dee22321205,You can't hug a kangaroo anymore they need to change sign main reason we went was for kangaroo interaction... the hurricanes has the place a lil messy but great place to go  
Not ready for primetime,October 2017,10,Safari Edventure,Richard S, 
Family fun,May 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Aidalive,Me and my family had some time to  spend before heading to the airport for our flight back home after our cruise vacation so we decided to take our son to the Miami Seaquarium he just love the animal shows and overall a great experience we got to take a photo with a dolphin and made memories that will last a lifetime the staff was very nice and helpful  if you get too hot you can cool down in one of the gift shop areas or sit in one of the restaurants for lunch Overall great experience for young children and people of all ages they also had place to store our luggage as we take Uber and don’t drive so that was very helpful
Very good way to spend the day.,June 2019,40,Miami Seaquarium,teknoge3k,This place is a lot of fun and the animals do some amazing things. It is always great to see Flipper! The whale looks sad though. I do hate seeing any animal in captivity but the workers seem to really care about the animals.
Rained,June 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,Mobsue,"Dolphin, killer whale and sea lion shows were excellent "
Mostly average exhibits. Please read the entire review,May 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,mattyc1987,"No, I am not PETA and yes there were parts of the Seaquarium we enjoyed. I won't be back for the simple fact of the condition of the manatees, dolphins, and orca."
Very entertaining and lots of exploration,June 2019,40,Miami Seaquarium,Johnny L,Lots of interaction with the animals and very recommended for any ages.  Great place and amazing people doing a fantastic job

A reconstructed old sinagogue converted in a museum,March 2017,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,Ester Z,It show the story of the jew in Miami. the first sinagogue and the life then and today. An exhibition of clothes was shown at present.
"""Hot Couture""",April 2017,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,silvia212,"a very interesting and colorful exhibit of the ""indelible footprint"" the Floridian Jews left on the garment industry"
Educational,May 2017,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,markmd,"This museum clearly traces the history of the Jewish people in Florida and more specifically in Southern Florida. Housed as it is in two former synagogues is most appropriate.  While there, if available, include a walking tour with Howard Brayer which adds entire dimension to the experience."
Really Interesting,May 2017,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,J30J,Really interesting museum.  Tells the story of Jews in S. Florida.  Surprisingly not what you would expect.  Great judaica store with some fun and unique items.  Also they do tours of Jewish South Beach and revolving exhibitions.
One stop shop till’ you drop!,December 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,U2452PRjulianp,"Visited multiple times in our comings! The social atmosphere is heightened with good music, drinks, views, games(ping pong, bags, big jenga, etc.), food trucks, and beautiful people! The mobile bathroom facilities are even cleaner/nicer than other nearby areas, haha! I never want to leave on every visit!"
Friends brunch,December 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,Tee_305,Amazing time. Love the $50 Moet bottles. Staff was great! Remember Lauren (hostess) especially she went out of her way to make us comfortable aka fan on a kinda hot day. Salty donuts onsite saved our life... ️️️️️
Loved it!,May 2017,50,Safari Edventure,Vivi4nn,Tickets are very affordable. Great place to come to get closer interactions with animals than you would at the local zoo. The safari has a very unique variety of animals! Also the staff is very informative of all the animals shown during presentation.
Hidden Gem,May 2017,50,Safari Edventure,Maytraveler,"We visited on Mother's Day.  Had the first ""ITS tour"" at 10am.  I was blown away!  Chris was our personal guide to the animals, he was full of information and helped us hold, touch pet tons of animals. We started with the wolves, they are so fabulous. I could not believe how sweet they were, and the large black male was so mischievous and funny.  Then we moved on to the pups. Energetic fur balls that snuggled and climbed in your lap.  They were adorable.  Then on to feed porcupine babies and pet them.  Then we fed hot dogs to the adolescent gators.  The power of those jaws!  Then we fed, rubbed and held a baby sloth.  Then we held a beautiful crested cockatoo.  She was very attentive and danced, kissed and fanned her head feathers all while sitting gently on our arms.  Then we fed goats, ponies and donkeys.  Then to the show!  Tarantulas, frogs, snakes, alligators, chinchillas, opossum, an adult sloth and a baby kangaroo rounded out the line up.  Best value for your money!  Schedule the ITS tour it is so worth every penny"
awesome,March 2017,50,Safari Edventure,Sukinha24,"this is an awesome place, you and your kids can interact with animals,feed them,and spend time with them,the shows are amazing,the staff is really nice.we hd a wonderful time."
Deplorable conditions for animals,May 2017,10,Safari Edventure,Nurseerika1,I can not believe this place is allowed to be open let alone have animals. The condition of the cages and enclosures were deplorable. It looks as if they haven't been cleaned in months. I have been to many rehabilitation and sanctuaries for animals and I have never seen anything this bad. The water the alligators are in is completely green. Some of the other tanks for turtles and fish were also green and could barely see through it. One of the pigs had a huge soar on its leg which was bright red and full of bugs. Another donkey or pony had the same issue. I felt so bad for these animals. They were probably rescued or surrendered from bad living conditions and are forced to live in another disgraceful place. If they cannot properly care for the animals they should surrender them to a place that can. 
Mixed place to visit,April 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,Vicki B,Would ultimately recommend this but your wallet won’t thank you - hence the none 5 star review
Fun and educational site,April 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,susi23,I came here for the first time when my son was 1 year. And here we are again. My son is 15 now and my daughter is 10. This place is not changed a lot. The show were so nice and giving a lot of informations about sea life. My kids enjoyed a lot. 
Overpriced!,January 2019,20,Miami Seaquarium,Carlos N,"I'm not going to get into how sad is to see those highly intelligent mammals being forced to perform for us....yes, they are forced...they are not happy, specially the killer whale. What will also leave you sad is the prices you have to pay to see these ""attractions"", the food, the parking, the photo, everything is overpriced guys...you know better that this, avoid this place at all cost."
Day visit...,April 2019,40,Miami Seaquarium,V5646MXrahulg,Visited this place in April 2019. Used Groupon. Would have been disappointed if I had to pay full prices. There are 4 shows lasting 10-20 minutes each. Fairly good. 2 of them being dolphin shows. The place definitely needs a facelift.  Food is pricey ($4 for a bottle of water; $28 for a cheese pizza pie). They do a good job laying out the schedule as soon as you walk in. You can be done with this place in 3-4 hours if you plan well. One time visit. 
Good work being done here,April 2019,40,Miami Seaquarium,chazkat,Small park compared to some. Great shows ongoing. Good Flamingo exhibit - happy for that since the hurricane 1.5 years ago chased most away in the wild. They are doing good work here rehabilitating Manatees who have been injured in the wild. Fish tank has a barracuda that looks ferocious.
Know the animals first hand,December 2016,50,Safari Edventure,QuixotePanza,"This place is not a zoo, is more a farm where they love animals and make people love animals. it does not have a great infrastructure, it does not have great attractions but they really care for animals. Do not miss the exhibition when animal keepers explain all the animals and allow you to touch them and to take care of them. Finally, get to touch and pet the wolves and the kangaroo."
Fun place to hang out,December 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,blondissa,This is not our first time at the Wharf. We go quite often on the weekends because it's a lot of fun. Different age groups are there and sometimes even their pets. We ordered Lobster Roll with Fries. It was very good. Our server was very attentive despite the big crowds.  Prices are reasonable. We had a good time.
Cool spot in Brickell,December 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,Mobile588724,"Cool place to go hangout with friends on the weekends. Very laid back and relaxing. We loved the music, great selection of food, and not to mention fantastic bay view. Came there with friends and our bartender Hector made some delicious drinks! Definitely a spot to visit when in Brickell."
Great service,November 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,Ilana I,"Lovely, my family and I had such a great time. Mayte was our waitress and she was gave us such good service would definitely recommend "
Definetly recommend,November 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,Julieth M,"Great place, Mayte was a great server and gave us great recommendations about the place and the city, would definitely come back! Great work!"
Unmistakably Cool,November 2018,40,The Wharf Miami,Kitaguma,"It seems to cater to all ages, though it is dominated by the young to be sure.  If you're looking for someplace unique to party, this is it."
Hands on animal and wolf encounter,March 2017,50,Safari Edventure,rjcareys,"This is our third trip to Safari  Edventure and let me say it gets better each time! My family members are animal lovers so this is a must do when they visit from New Jersey. The animals are loved by the caretakers and most are rescues that makes it more special. The show was both informative and fun. They are very knowledgeable and patient. This is the closest expierience that anyone can get to a sloth, kangaroo, etc. . The wolf encounter is always one of my favorite , but this visit was even more special. The Wolves had two litters of pups and the highlight was holding and snuggling with them. We fell in love with them. My family loved the expierence.  If you are on the fence about going go sooner than later while they pups are ready for handling..... if your like me wear sneakers. I will absolutely return........"
Adorable adventure,February 2017,40,Safari Edventure,MarcTuna127,"Well being there twice, once with my lady and once with grand kids my lady and her daughter and son-in -law and enjoying both visits. It is a very rustic cute experience. The help are very knowledgeable and engaging. They teach you about different animals and even let you touch some during a introduction. It is a worth while place to visit "
Such a fun unique experience,March 2017,50,Safari Edventure,katiegeary628,"Went to safari edventure for the ""in the scenes"" tour with my sister whose favorite animal is the sloth. (So as you can imagine we were there specifically for the sloth. lol) they advised us upon arrival that sometimes the sloth doesn't feel like being held and hands on interaction isn't guaranteed but regardless we would be able to visit the sloth. Lauren was our tour guide and she was amazing! Super informative and friendly. But of course the sloth wasn't feeling it this morning. Glen, who I believe is the owner came to check on us and knowing that my sister loved sloths and was there specifically for him told us to come find him after our tour and if the sloth was feeling more friendly later he would bring us back to the sloth exhibit. So we went along with our tour, fed gators, emus, porcupine and had hands on interaction with wolves and their pups! So cool! After finishing our tour we were given livestock food to feed the goats and horses. So as we're feeding the animals Glen went out of his way to track us down because Merlin the sloth was feeling friendly! It was such an amazing experience but the customer service they provided (while respecting and loving their animals) was above and beyond. We definitely recommend this place and will be visiting again with friends. "
Fun,April 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Mrs_McCulley,"This was a fun place to go! We used Groupon and at a discounted price of 29 per adult, we both felt it was a great and fair value as a few areas and most food venues were closed. We spent about 4.5 hours there and saw so much! The shows were educational and fun to watch. We both loved this experience and recommend it highly for at or about the price we paid. Plenty of cool mist cooling stations and opportunities to interact with animals. We agreed when we return to Miami, we would visit Miami Seaquarium again. Great place for kids too."
Miami Seaquarium needs resources,April 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,AprilRB,I won’t leave a scaling review but I did see that this aquarium needs resources to make improvements. The orca/dolphin show was kid-friendly & entertaining. I’m not sure that I should enjoy seeing all of this wildlife held captive outside of their natural habitats. My rating is more accurately captured between poor & average.
Nice place,April 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,Cszepak,"Good place to spend 4-6 hours with your kids. Nice aquariums. Good shows. Place is a bit old, including the restaurants, etc... "
Nice place ,April 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Rizzok080,The seaquarium was very cute. We got our tickets on Groupon and did not purchase any extra experiences. We watched several programs and then just wandered around. Only one restaurant and 2 snack stands were open (I assume because it’s not peak season?) and the mangrove nature walk was under construction. 
Overpriced ........,April 2019,20,Miami Seaquarium,Mark P,We visited the Seaquarium a few weeks ago with high expectations. The small childrens waterpark is a nice idea but the actual aquarium a disappointment. Dolphin and Killer whale show was ok but we have seen better. The aquariums were lack lustre and did not have a the variety or range of fish you would expect. Some major investment is needed to overall the displays. As a family we love normally love visiting places like this but would advise to save your money.
Awesome experience!,March 2017,50,Safari Edventure,catlady100,"Wow We did the one hour tour and got to pet/kiss the wolves, hold wolf cubs, hold a sloth, feed emus, feed and pet porcupines, hold the 13 ft python, feed the alligators and learn about the animals and how they ended up in this educational facility.  There were so many animals there and the staff talked to us about each of them from the bunnies, to the tortoises to the birds, etc  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  The animals are all well taken care of.  Definitely worth going to!"
You cannot go wrong,March 2017,50,Safari Edventure,ryamss64,"Safari Edventure was very enjoyable. One in our group of 4 were able to hold the sloth, a little disappointing but okay. Touched and fed the prehensile tailed porcupines, fed the alligators (awesome - the way they come up to get fed it almost, almost makes you forget you cannot pet them), Got in the pen with the arctic wolves and timber wolves and then there was the wolf cubs. The price for the private tour, you cannot go wrong compared to other experiences in the area that cost much more. I did want to feed the baby pigs, when I went to buy bottles at the ticket area I was told it was included in the tour, it never happened. A little disappointed, but the other edventures were excellent. We did not stay for the 'show', we only caught the end to see the kangaroo and the kids were able to pet her."
Easy by boat,October 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,Excursion23000292524,"Drinks aren't too crazy, the energy is refreshing, and they tie up and take care of your boat without charging too much."
Wonderful attraction dedicated to helping animals,January 2017,50,Safari Edventure,rdh1978,"I visited Safari Edventure today and was overly impressed! Let me start by saying, we did not have reservations for a private tour because it didn't seem necessary from the website.  However, when we arrived, we quickly realized that during this time of school vacation it would have been best.  The private tours were sold out.  However, I watched the entire team here scramble to make sure they accomodated everyone  possible that wanted a tour after the sell out!  That included my husband and I and we were so grateful! I read through all the negative reviews and all I can say is that people who do not believe in zoos will always have something to say.  I, however, see things differently.  I too asked where many of the animals came from and the response most often given was that someone ignorantly adopted the animal without a permit to do so or without realizing what they were getting into.  Yes, some were obtained from other facilities and others were born there but without facilities like Safari Edventure, the formerly mentioned animals may have no choice but to be put down by the state!  I am an avid animal lover and I thought these animals seemed very well cared for.  They seemed to enjoy the attention and love they get from the staff, looked healthy and well maintained.  We were able to pet wolves, foxes, feed alligators, porcupines, baby pigs and emus as well as hold an exotic bird and a sloth! The staff seemed to really love the animals and were well informed to educate us about all the animals on premise. The presentation given was wonderful and it even gave those who didn't want a private tour the opportunity to pet and hold different animals as well as obtain photos.  I have had many opportunities to visit zoos/aquariums for personal encounters and I thought this was very well done.  The fact that they are non-profit and trying to help animals in need makes me feel happy not sad like some of the other reviewers on this site."
Good experience overall but alarmingly small cages,January 2017,30,Safari Edventure,Louise T,"However, I came away alarmed at the small sizes of many of the cages -  the cockatoos and macaws being possibly the worst - in ornamental, oval cages that were barely larger than themselves.  There were other animals (eg rabbits) who were just about able to lay down but not move around otherwise - certainly not hop or run.  And the wolves' enclosure is also pretty restrictive for such large animals.  It marred the experience and seems to contradict their whole ethos.  The cages may conform to standards (?) but I found it distressing to see such beautiful animals in such restrictive confinement."
Fun Animal Encounters,December 2016,40,Safari Edventure,Tom42532,"We visited based on the high ratings from Trip Advisor and were not disappointed! They have an interesting collection of mammals, reptiles and birds. The base cost is very reasonable (special tours are quite a bit extra) and the base price includes opportunities to hold or pet a number of animals. The place is relatively small and can be done in an hour if you are in a hurry, but their animal show takes over an hour - and is worth the time. The only reason for a 4 rating instead of a 5: a number of the enclosures are old and small and the animals cannot be very happy in them."
Not What it Used To Be. Save Your Money ,March 2019,10,Miami Seaquarium,flhbob83,I grew up going to the Seaquarium.. in its day it was a beautiful well maintained attraction with a reasonable entrance fee for the times. Now its an overpriced run down facility that needs some serious renovations. So disappointed to know how nice it used to be and could be again if they sank some money back into the place instead of just keeping all the profits. Drive north and go to SeaWorld. You wont be sorry 
A wonderful experience and fun day out!,March 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,AliceM2845,The Sea Aquarium is magnificent experience and be sure to come in the morning and stay all day too see the various shows and interactions that are on a continual schedule! It is a super fun day out!
Very Expensive Tickets and Facilities Were In Poor Condition!,November 2018,10,Miami Seaquarium,Jackie A,It was a pricey ticket and we felt like we got ripped off only minutes after entering. It was poorly maintained and the shows were boring! The water in several exhibits was dirty looking and the whole facility was run down. We would not return to this facility and definitely would not recommend to anyone visiting the area.
The dolphins and sea lions,March 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,Emerald2812,Don’t hope for much food from the restaurants. They cost quite a lot and expect to spend the entire day there especially when you are with children. Overall it was a nice experience and I won’t do it again.
Miami seaquarium,April 2018,30,Miami Seaquarium,Travelexpt,"Very expensive, the place was build in 1955 and needs a total redo in my opinion. not worth the money the shows are mediocre and the food is so,so, not much to do. Swimming with the dolphin is probably the best thing to do. The penguins experience is also ok put not great. Go to Sea World Orlando instead."
Excellent place to visit!  ,January 2017,50,Safari Edventure,KRC2014,"My children and I did a ""ITS"" tour.  We went in with and pet the wolves, the porcupines, foxes, the sloths and several other animals.  The experience was one that my children will remember for ever... Not to mention that it was very reasonably priced compared to similar places."
So Much Fun!!!!,January 2017,50,Safari Edventure,nryan5,"We took an ""in the scenes"" tour during a recent trip to Miami. It was 100000% worth it. Amazing to get to interact with so many animals and learn about how they came to the Safari Edventure. I cannot think of another place where you can hold a baby sloth and feed an alligator and still learn about wolf dog hybrids. Immensely entertaining to go for a few hours. Our tour guide, Chris I believe his name was, was great!"
Nice chill scenic,October 2018,40,The Wharf Miami,gatormiami,Good spot right on the river for cocktails and food trucks. Nothing fancy but a nice crowd- fun during the day watching the boat go past....Gabriela was super awesome and made great cocktails! Cheers!
We loved it!,November 2016,50,Safari Edventure,RainDayMom,Where else can you hold an alligator and a sloth and touch so many different animals?  Hanging out with the wolves was also amazing. Our kids loved it too!
Great experience. ,November 2016,40,Safari Edventure,TMonax,Well organized place with a large selection of animals. Feels well run. Presentations were excellent and very engaging. Definitely worth spending a few hours there. 
Nice place,November 2016,50,Safari Edventure,c0128,"This place was very nice to visit and it's wonderful what they do for the animals- they're all rescued. Wide variety of animals and you can get up close to them and go in the wolf cage and pet them, they are very friendly. You can pay $5 more to hold a baby sloth- it's so cute! The animal show was good and employee Pedro very knowledgable and super friendly! Would recommend this place!"
Fantastic experience,December 2016,50,Safari Edventure,Yikai Z,Did not expect this to be such a wonderful journey. Lots of interesting animals. The staffs are super friendly. The show is extremely fun and we touched and photoed all of them. Definitely recommend it!!!!!
A must with small children,March 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Dayter,We take our kids down during our annual Miami trip. The place is fantastic and there are so many activities to do there. A nice treat to get away from the “city” and spend some time in key Biscayne too
Sadly in need of renovations,March 2019,20,Miami Seaquarium,Marta B,"Went with my niece and her boys after 25 years of not visiting.  Other than the Flipper show area, the Seaquarium is very run down. It is grossly overpriced for what you receive.  Most of the shops and places to eat were closed.  It would be sad for Miami to lose this attraction,  but cannot see myself returning."
not so bad,March 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,LanaLavina,As a result we spent here about 6 hours.
exelent place!,February 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,hermanhauer,we enjoyed it very much! all the shows were extremely interesting! its a exelent place to go with your family
Average facility and poorly maintained,March 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,P1155DTjonathanp,I was expecting a better experience for a Seaquarium in one of the largest cities in the US.  The facility was poorly maintained and the exhibits were average at best.  I think Miami can do better!
Great little hidden treasure of South Florida ,November 2016,50,Safari Edventure,Todd B,"I've lived in South Florida for over 40 years and never knew about this little treasure. My in laws took us just recently and let me tell you. I felt like a little kid again. It's not a huge place, but it's a great place for up close interaction with wild animals. I had so much fun I forgot to take pictures. The two things I enjoyed the most was being able to actually get into a cage with 3 full breed wolves and it that was free to do. Being able to get that close and pet them was something that made me feel like a kid again. I've always loved wolves for some reason and there I was in there with 3 of them petting them. And also all of the other wonderful animals you can interact with. "
great bar experience,November 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,0therry0,"What a great spot to hang out with friends :) They have different food trucks and different bars to hang out. My friends and I went to the inside bar and our bartender Hector worked like a jumbo jet, super fast :) and always friendly. Even though it was crazy busy he always checked on us and made sure we are good. I will be back soon for a drink and this amazing lobster sandwich :)"
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES IN THE WHOLE WORLD!,September 2016,50,Safari Edventure,suzy814,"oh my goodness! I came here to visit after seeing some great reviews on tripadvisor and it was literally the best decision i have ever made! It was super affordable and super educational too! it's great for kids and families! the volunteers there are great and you can tell they love what they do! i loved being bale to hold the animals!! i have always wanted to hold a sloth and finally got to! and on top of that, i got to hangout with wolves, and hold other animals they had here! :D I recommend this to everyone !"
Best Birthday EVER!!!,August 2016,50,Safari Edventure,JenniAnderson77,"My best friend took me here for my birthday. She had said previously how amazing it was (she lives down there, but I live in Boca Raton, an hour away). We got there and saw a wonderful animal show/talk with the keepers. They let you hold and take pictures with them. Really informative and fun. We held a baby sloth <3 We loved seeing the bats. They were so sweet and beautiful. Got to pet wolves, and feed pigs, lemurs, etc :) Such a wonderful place. Please go and show your support or this place and how wonderful the keepers and animals are. It has beautiful plants ans statues as well. Great for photographers too."
An extraordinary place for a family weekend!,May 2016,50,Safari Edventure,JuliaV1074,"I visited this park with my family, including a kid and we fell in love with it! We were impressed by the extraordinary selection of animals, low prices, many opportunities for interaction with rare species, etc. It is obvious that the place is run by really devoted people, who love what they are doing. Greatly recommend to visit it!"
A wonderful and Amazing experience for everybody!!!,September 2016,50,Safari Edventure,Gloway C,"An Amazing place to visit, I went with my Wife and my 2 kids (5 yro & 11 yro) the visit was very personal, the staff is really friendly and you were able see many exotic animals and interact with them like play with the Wolves, hold a big boa snake, hold a tarantula,  hold a baby alligator, and much more. Don't miss the show!!! Guys doing the show was great!! This was a great experience for my family and I."
Best thing to do in the Miami Area,July 2016,50,Safari Edventure,FabianKrieger,"We visited last july not really knowing what to expect. Upon arrival we were imediately greeted by very nice staff members and that experience continued at the counter where we bought our tickets. We were smart enough to forget our bug repellent, because who needs bug repellent in South Florida!, we didnt even have to ask the kind lady behind the desk who imediately offered that we could use hers. She did not have to do this but deciced to do so anyways. We bought regular admission tickets and extra tickets to pet a sloth. We then walked the 'trail' through the 'park' and absolutely loved every animal exhibition. It might seem like the animals are in relatively small areas but all the animals seemed happy and none showed any signs of sadness. Feeding the monkey-like creatures was our favourite part of the already amazing day. You can buy food for them for $0,25 from a machine next to the exibit. We then continued our walk and went to the wolve encounter where we met a great staff member, sadly i've forgotten his name. He was incredibly friendly and you could tell that his goal was to educate us about the animals. He sure did! Then we made our way to the animal show. This is something you must do if you go here, i will not spoil what you will see but it is incredibly educational and fun at the same time. Especially for children (arent we all?) You can purchase snacks and water from vending machines for about a buck. Highly suggest u bring a couple of dollars to do so if you plan on visiting during the warm days. At the end of the animal show we got to hold the sloths, we we're not rushed at all and given all the time we needed to enjoy this moment. A+ for the day. We will return!"
Sea Trek is a must do,March 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Alaric H,Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Miami Seaquarium. It certainly is not the same as it was when I went on a school field trip 45 years ago. And you just do the Seatrek. It was an awesome experience.
Wow!!,March 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,holidaybeachsun,Great day at Miami Seaquarium 
Really nice,March 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Ana_Ueda,It was really nice to see all the shows and the animals and have the opportunity to get in touch with them. Reserve at least 3 hours to see the whole place and watch the shows and even more if you want to get the animal encounters.
Not worth it,March 2019,10,Miami Seaquarium,Discover452929,"The place is still the same for 30 years when I went last, dirty and less shows than before. Not worth to pay $50"
Dolphin encounter ,April 2018,50,Miami Seaquarium,957tamiz,"I visit aquariums almost everywhere I go and wasn’t disappointed in Miami. Its made more as a zoo than aquarium so its a lot of walking but you can make a day out of it. They feature sealion shows, dolphin shows and several other entertainment options or you can just walk around and enjoy the exhibits. For extra charge you can do Dolphin or SeaLion encounter "
Had such a great time.,December 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,MrScottEddy,"I love this place because you can arrive by boat (it's so easy). Anyway, staff is great, cocktails are amazing and food trucks are super delicious!!!"
We took a bus ride .,May 2017,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,La Teasegh J,Around the city and was told a little history   about the place. It so interesting   and would erk to learn the history   about the very nice colored building.  Next time will come see ir.
Fantastic find!,December 2017,50,Safari Edventure,Ciber004,It cost $18 per adult and $15 per child so it was a great experience without breaking the bank. Totally worth it. I’d go back in a heartbeat. Kids loved it.   
Andrea!,January 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,Aymara L,"Hosted an event at this venue, and Andrea was a very attentive and kind server. She is an example of the customer service we all expect. Moreover, I've been here a bunch of times and I love the day vibes. It's the definition of ""Miami""."
"Okay it's good, but not that good!",September 2018,40,The Wharf Miami,monicapQ6060LG,"I mean, in Miami it has always been like that. The ""new cool place"" is where you find everyone at. That's the Wharf now, but it could be anything tomorrow. It's a forever changing situation. I love to go on Fridays to enjoy a few beers while sitting next to the sea. But come on, there's like a million places to just do that in Miami! It's true, you can dance, there's an area for that and another one that seems more like a lounge to sit around and relax but under the stars! Biggest pros: the sea and the fact that you get to be outside. "
Awesomeness ,February 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,Denisse O,"Can I say I have been going to this place for the past month. I wouldn't have it any other way. Hector Jimenez is absolutely amazing, he is the reason why we go. He is professional and actually knows what he is doing. I told him what I did t like and he said ""I Got You"" and came back with the most delicious cocktail. My favorite place. He not only has the best customer service I have encountered, he also cares and is never too busy to hear what the client wants. I will always go there because Hector not only offer you drinks, he offers an experience."
Loved This Place!,July 2016,50,Safari Edventure,KyBriTyMom,"We were not bothered by bugs while were were there, but I can imagine that some days it's the kind of place you'd need bug spray. Also bring water."
Fun place,August 2016,50,Safari Edventure,Alejandra D,"Overall, you will enjoy this place. It's very relaxing and is a great experience for the kiddos."
A Gem,August 2016,50,Safari Edventure,Aryeh C,A little known but fantastic attraction. Good for adults and kids of all ages. Well worth the admission fee. Plan on being there for at least 3 hours. Max. 5. Great hands on fun. The kids will have great stories to share with their friends.
Fabulous Find!,August 2016,50,Safari Edventure,jerirp,"I sure did score when I found this tropical paradise down South! I wanted to do something different for my Father's birthday and he is an animal lover. This seemed like fun but we weren't sure how much time we could spend there, in the heat, so we reserved seats for a movie later in the afternoon... We almost missed the movie.... We had so much fun playing with all of the animals and feeding the ones we could, that we didn't want to leave!  We played with wolves, foxes, kangaroos, porcupines, birds, alligators, emus, mini horses and donkeys, turkeys, spiders, pigs and lemurs, just to name a few of the fascinating animals that this sanctuary has to offer. The tour guide we had was very knowledgeable and the animals welcomed the staff excitedly which says a lot to me.  I would recommend the ITS tour and playing with the wolves. Feeding the alligator was more of a man's sport but they were fascinated with it. The girls fed the emus and we loved it."
Amazing for  all ages !!!!,August 2016,50,Safari Edventure,Yiayia111009,"Imagine playing with a real timber wolf, or an Artic wolf. Think about your Christmas card picture with you holding a baby sloth. Watching piglets run around ""oinking"". Holding a tarantula and an alligator. Petting a skunk and know you won't come out STINKY!!!! Such a inexpensive, FUN day !!    ALL THESE ANIMALS ARE THERE !!"
Great surprise!,November 2018,40,Miami Seaquarium,Awa L,It was great and everyone was having fun.
Visit,February 2019,40,Miami Seaquarium,971karenv,I thought it would have been bigger than it was. Got to see some of the animals you don't get to see otherwise. One area was down due to renovations.
Terrible,February 2019,10,Miami Seaquarium,HeidiJM,"Half of the enclosures were closed/out of bounds which meant that you could hardly see any of the animals advertised. Most of the animals looked unhappy, especially the parrots; they were screeching and plucking, leaving large bald areas. Birds that are bored and anxious pluck their feathers and this is an obvious sign of mistreatment. The best exhibit we went to was the first one which was a touch pool with cleaner fish. The most interesting and you could interact with them. The dolphin show made us reconsider our actions in visiting the seaquarium. Animal cruelty? Do the dolphins like it? When you enter the park you are given a green sheet with show times on it which would be useful however they all started 5 minutes late and lasted a half the time they are supposed to. Considering we payed $50 each for our tickets we were quite disappointed by the standard of this park. "
Dolphin Odyssey really a disappointment ,February 2019,20,Miami Seaquarium,Jules777_11,"Dolphin Odyssey is supposed to be about swimming with dolphins, right? Well, out of the whole session you really get to swim with the dolphin ONE time which is about 30 seconds. Dolphin takes you across the pool. The rest of it is dolphin interaction with not just you, dolphin and trainer . It’s you, trainer and whole bunch of other people. But what makes it the most disappointing of all is the whole thing is so commercialized. It’s not about you and your time with dolphin, it’s about making few perfect pictures of you so they can sell them to you for a hefty price. To me, i”d pay a lot more to just see my child in a water with the dolphin and trainer for 15 minutes of pure water time. Erase show effects, talking and all the tricks dolphins can do. We’ve seen the shows. Not happy. Not worth it"
Disappointing,February 2019,20,Miami Seaquarium,BigSkyTripper,Was really expecting a better quality seaquarium out of Miami.  The holding tanks for the animals were far too small and some of them were so dirty... it was really sad. For as much as they overcharge to get in (in addition to the cost of parking) you would think they could provide better facilities for the animals.
Way Exceeded Our Expectations ,December 2017,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,Huskerthedog,Would I return to the Jewish Museum of Florida?  Yes and I will keep track of the next special exhibition. 
Small museum with interesting exhibits,December 2017,40,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,jronkowski,This tiny museum on the history of Jews especially in South Florida is only for people who want to learn more about this subject. I learned a lot and they had also had an exhibit about an American Jewish woman photographer and a beautiful exhibition of yads made of an amazing variety of material. A security guard wands visitors before the door is open.
The non superficial side of Miami,February 2012,50,Colony Theatre,Aereal,"besides the point the Pianist were outstanding, this old and beautiful place in Lincoln Rd. is a must see if you visit Miami."
A really good experience for animal lovers!,June 2018,50,Safari Edventure,rhathb,"This is what my wife wanted to do for her birthday and I'm glad that we had the experience. We booked the one hour personal tour and it was well worth the fee. Many birds including Amazons, Macaws, Cockatoos and Rheas and others were really entertaining. They also have foxes and many pigs. The horses, donkeys and goats were in a large enclosure that love to be fed. The Sloths and porcupines take food right from your hands. The big hit for my wife were the Wolves. A large male is really big and really sweet. He has other part wolves to keep him company. Whole Foods donate much of the fresh food for the animals. I thought that that was very cool. All in all a delightful experience. Most of the workers were volunteers who cared so much for this place and the animals. Safari Edventure needs donations as well as paying customers to stay viable. These animals come from people who can no longer take care of them and places like this are the places that make a difference."
Fantastic hands on Edvenrure,May 2018,50,Safari Edventure,ovidiokaba,"After the first visit, I had to bring family and friends. Found it to be very unique in their presentation and informative. The wolf expirience is fantastic. "
Disturbing and Appalling Animal Visit,June 2018,10,Safari Edventure,Shelly B,"We are an animal loving family who has respect for the natural world and its creatures. We left upset we had contributed to this ""facility"". The cages, the grounds in general, the fenced in areas for the goats, donkeys, horses, the tanks for the turtles were so badly kept it was disgusting. It looked like a dump which even included an old swimming pool ladder just off to the side. The vegetation, grassy areas were overgrown. The enclosures themselves were the dingiest we have ever seen in any animal care facility. I read a comment from the owner, who responded to another visitor's post about how upset they were with the conditions, that this facility passes inspection from various agencies, and I find that hard to swallow.  We immediately wanted to start cleaning up habitats and  the grounds in general which would require a huge dumpster. It was hard to shake off that experience knowing those animals don't have the option to leave and find shelter in a much healthier, cleaner environment. If anyone who has the power to make change there reads this, please get help and clean that place up!"
Memories Were Made!,July 2018,50,Safari Edventure,MaaMaaMore,"We had the pleasure of taking the ITS tour with our knowledgeable guide, Carlos. The animals that are here were animals that were abandoned or hurt in the wild and needed a place to go. Carlos took us inside the different animal enclosures to feed and learn about each animal's story and about each animal species  We met and fed lemurs, monkeys, alligators, emus, bat-eared foxes, baby pigs, farm animals, and wolves.  Petting and feeding Arthur the sloth was a once in a lifetime opportunity!   We highly recommend Safari Edventures!"
The host was hospitable and thoughtful,February 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,KokoJax,I've referred all of my friends at the University of Miami to get in touch with Lauren.
"Great vibe, great concept",March 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,rickyspa1,"This bar/multi cuisine restaurant by the Miami river has a great vibe and it has a great concept. Trendy bar with good mojito variations, about 7-8 pop up restaurants with diverse cuisine. I really liked the place and I will come back"
So much fun for all ages! ,March 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,Ameola9,This place is incredible!! So much fun and great for all ages. My husband and I went here on a Sunday just to hang out and had such a fun time. They have 9 bars and a bunch of different food trucks. Definitely get the lobster roll from OG Ceviche abs Seafood. The best part about the day was the music and atmosphere. There were infant babies all the way up to 80 year olds there and literally everyone was enjoying themselves. It’s also pretty cheap for good and drinks are VERY cheap! We will be back! 
Great Service ,April 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,Elena I,"Oh, one more thing: Street parking is $3 an hour and make sure you don't go over because they ticket like crazy - the parking authority is constantly circling the area."
Only museum in the neighborhood,December 2017,20,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,ssm222,Went to this museum mainly because it was 2 blocks from hotel.  Not much to see so felt depressing not inspirational.  
Interesting collection of information about Jews in Florida,January 2018,40,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,stevelotte,Exhibit was well curated and the temporary exhibits were interesting as well.  There was a great video to watch about Jews in Florida/Miami area.  Definitely needed an hour and half to visit.
Great Experience!!!,August 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,40manuels,"Love taking my kids to spend summer time here... kids can learn a lot and have fun watching all the amazing shows they have a long the day... Also they can splash to calm the heat.. great wait to spent quality time with the family... My kids learn a lot about sea animals and their conservation... I really enjoy being here every time, dinning options are good and everybody is very friendly and helpful if you need something ... special thanks to the customer service representative Grecia and Ilsi.. if you have a problem you can always count with them... thanks so much!!"
New experience at the Miami Seaquarium,August 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Clarissa B,I had the best experience ever at the Seaquarium! They have a new program called the shark and stingray interaction. Not only does this program have the coolest animals it has two great experts (Shannon and Mike)talking you through the interaction and telling you about the animals you’re having an interaction with. They know every animal by name and if you’re lucky you get to help train a shark(how cool is that!) I highly recommend this program! It’ll totally be worth it! ️️️️️
Heat stroke central,August 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,shatterah,"As far as an aquarium goes, this is nothing special. Typical aquarium shows and animals. Most of the “large” tanks are pretty small and I felt bad for the animals to be honest. They try to spin “oceanic conservation” as the theme to their shows but really they are making money by making wild animals do tricks. Forgetting the ethical aspect, this is Very Much an outside aquarium so you will be in the Miami blazing heat all day!!! Not even fans to create som drift/wind. So unless you don’t sweat or mind drenching sweat SKIP this place and go to dozens of indoor aquariums in the USA. "
Decent little Theater in the Heart of the Beach,April 2015,30,Colony Theatre,Allansha,This is a lovely little theater in the heart of Miami Beach but other than having a retro look and feel to it there is nothing extraordinarily special about this place. It is a good spot to stop and take a few Photos of it.
Top Notch Theater,January 2016,50,Colony Theatre,R C,"Very nice, small theater. Great vibe, comfortable seat, though not too wide. The bar is not really a bar, just a tiny counter. But there are plenty of bars on either side. We saw ""The Golem of Havana"", great venue for that show. The theater is part of Miami Beach history, before it was trendy.  I highly recommend going to a show there, easy parking, easy drinks and dinner. Fantastic people watching outside."
Nice cozy theater,February 2016,50,Colony Theatre,nabeab,Very nice!
THe Evils of History Continue On and On,February 2016,50,Colony Theatre,Rosemarie R,"Excellent! Haussman portrays the darkside of humanity that has prevailed for centuries.WHen evil people become empowered through inimidaton , violence, brutality and murder, the victims suffer, fear for their lives and try desperatel to escape if they can. From the early times of the Romans occupying Judea, torturing the citizenry  to the Midlle Ages with the Crusades to the Inquisition in Spain to Nazi Germany and on to Havana in the 50's, evil pervaded the lives of those seeking and obtaining power while good and innocent people were victimized and even killed., Will such horrible events ever stop being repeated?"
WOLVES,October 2018,50,Safari Edventure,teresahA7888JF,"I like to go on random adventures and this was definitely one of the better ones. To my surprise I was able to have close encounters with multiple animals you don't normally do at zoos like a sloth, opossum, and my favorite the wolf encounter. These people are doing a great job at educating people and conservation as well as rescue. For the price this place is under rated and a well hidden gem i the heart of homestead. Do you self a favor and go!"
"Good value, might be a little rustic for some but worth the drive.",November 2018,40,Safari Edventure,W6088CNpeterp,"My wife and I took three of our grandchildren ages 11,9 and 7.  I used them as the barometer for the fun index and they really enjoyed it.  You're allowed to roam free for as long as you wish on the grounds and they have periodic shows in the amphitheater where they highlight different animals that you're allowed to touch and carry.  The finale is getting in the wolf cages and being allowed to pet them.  Really a great experience for the kids. "
Great place to visit!!,December 2018,50,Safari Edventure,Debcfair,"I brought my two daughters, ages 17 and 22 to the Safari Edventure. We had a very nice time visiting and thoroughly enjoyed the hands on experiences. Well worth the price of admission.  Pedro was a great guide and was so accommodating. We will visit this beautiful place again!"
Don't do it,December 2018,10,Safari Edventure,Sunseekergirl77,"Bad value for the money and it is really yucky.  There are huge spider webs and tons of spiders EVERYWHERE.  We saw several rats running around as we were walking around the property.  The sloth was not to be found and no one would answer us as to why.  No kangaroos, no baby wolves.  We fed the donkey and horses, looked at some pigs and bunnies and other misc. small animals.  We went into the wolf cage which was a mistake and should not have done.  One of the other visitors still had a back pack on and one of the wolves attacked it trying to get it off of her and would not let go....it was very scary."
Very nice place to visit,December 2018,50,Safari Edventure,Pam D,Definitely a nice place to visit if you like animals and like to support animal organizations that are doing good things.
"What a pretty church, what a warm congregation",March 2016,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,Vzzg,"I stayed in SoBe over the recent Easter holiday and attended St. Francis for Palm Sunday, Holy  Thursday and Easter Sunday Masses.  The church is so pretty and clean and inviting.  The masses use a Spanish/English missal so everyone feels able to participate.  The music director did a wonderful job celebrating the season, and I loved hearing the Messiah play before Easter morning mass."
"Friendly church, beautiful vigil",March 2016,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,Broadwayfan154963,"We visited for the Easter vigil and the mass was done in English, Spanish, and Italian! How beautiful. We were made to feel very welcome and the music was beautiful."
Cute church,October 2015,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,PeruTrav,There are weekend activities to support locals or homeless
Fun Times with Friends!,March 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,Loucious,Cool Hangout place to meet & greet! Drinks are reasonable & finger food is acceptable! Great place to bring your boat too! GetSome!!
"Fun place, great food",May 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,ThaisO_13,"This place is really fun for family and friends. It has a lot of options for you to eat, like seafood, mexican food and hamburguers. It also has a great view of the river and a lot of options of drinks, beers, wines, etc. "
Nice atmosphere,June 2019,30,The Wharf Miami,nikblaarr,"Now the good... very nice atmosphere. If you can get a seat right next to where the boats pull up, there’s  a nice ambience. The staff was very nice and friendly"
Awesome 👍 Hangout Spot!!!,December 2018,50,The Wharf Miami,525marshas,"We had a great time socializing and drinking Veuve Clicquot Rose Champagne. The food option was satisfying, definitely one if my favorite spot to hang out."
Nice place to hangout,July 2019,40,The Wharf Miami,DBernard1029,"This was the first time I’d been to the wharf. It is definitely a great place to take pictures and aesthetically pleasing. Right on the water, and covered with turf. It felt like you were in a tropical garden without an urban area. They have a covered area and an open air area with umbrellas and string lights. It has a fun atmosphere. People were dressed up and down, some in bathing suits, but they do have a sign outside that says they can turn you away for not adhering to dress code (subject to their discretion). Plus side is there’s no entry fee. Typical to Miami, the drinks and food are definitely overpriced. Unless I was starving, I probably wouldn’t choose to eat there. This is not to say the food doesn’t look good, because it does, just pricey. If I went there just for food, that’s one thing, but food with drinks would easily be $50 in one trip. I got a beer for $7 and a strawberry mojito for $13. The mojito was very good. Didn’t seem like they skimped on alcohol, but it’s hard to say for sure. They offered the mojitos in a variety of flavors and they came with a piece of sugar cane which was a fun addition. I would definitely go back for a drink or two but this couldn’t be my regular spot or I’d be broke. Downside is you either have to valet for $15 or park somewhere down the street and pay about $3 an hour. "
Excellent museum,February 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,Vegan21,"What a wonderful museum outlining the history of the Jewish people in Miami. The presentations were extremely well done and informative. The building is beautiful  and the space is well utilized. We spent about two hours reading and taking in the displays. Worth the visit for anyone who loves to learn about history, culture, religion and traditions. "
Walking tour,February 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,rje12345,Howard Brayer gave us an excellent walking tour and we learned quite a bit. The museum itself was also very interesting and well organized.
Miami Seaquarium,July 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,NirajBasotia,"Honestly a bit of a disappointment. Dolphins seem to be the only attraction. spent about 2-3 hrs moving around & watching various shows, good but not very impressive"
Excellent experience with the Dolphins,September 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Kate K,We had an amazing experience with swimming with the dolphins! We got amazing photos that we will keep with us forever. My husband and I were on our honeymoon and basically got a private session with 4 dolphins. Melissa F. who was our trainer was just amazing! We couldn’t be happier. They truly care about the animals and make sure they are really happy and well taken care of. 100% worth it. Would highly recommend to everyone : )
Excellent experience ,September 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,776auraa,Maryland
Swimming with Melissa F and Rana,September 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,MiamisSweetCoco,I was pleasantly surprised went I went to swim with the dolphins.  The experience was so enjoyable with the care and patience provided by Melissa F. and Rana.  Our group of cancer survivors relaxed and interacted with those wonderful animals for a funfilled day.
The Heart of South Beach,February 2018,50,Colony Theatre,TheatreLover428,"Saw The Elaborate Entrance Of Chad Deity on Feb. 10th and...wow! I'm so amazed by this theatre and it's in house theatre company. You rarely see theatre this good in South Florida. In fact, you never see it. The shows are of the best quality and never fail to move. The venue itself is beautiful. It's vintage are deco design and grandiose feel make you feel like you've been transported back to the 1930s'. I'll take this over the Arsht and Broward Performing Arts Center any day of the week!"
Great theater!,June 2018,50,Colony Theatre,nabeab,"We came to see “The Album”, great production, amazing actors, only VIP seating, very different setting. Everytime we come here they do something different. It id an old and small nice theater."
Small but perfect theatre size!,March 2019,50,Colony Theatre,sivanmoyal,"We went to see ‘Confessions of a Cocaine Cowboy’ and the play had lasted for around 2.5 hours. We really enjoyed our experience and is a conveniently located next to bars, stores, and restaurants nearby."
Art Deco at its best ,April 2019,40,Colony Theatre,StephenCr0ss,Look and feel of the 1950ts and in the Lincoln Road area. Great old theater and well worth a stop off. 
Lots of fun,February 2019,50,Safari Edventure,veryhopeful2011,"We really enjoyed visiting this place. All the animals have been rescued or rehomed. We especially enjoyed the presentation given by a knowledgeable volunteer where we could hold or pet a python, tarantula, baby alligator, skunk and more. The one disappointment was that we could only pet the sloth while it slept in a box. Would have liked to hold it as in the pics. But had a good time and will go again."
Best wolf interaction ever !!,March 2019,50,Safari Edventure,angelogS8561DC,"Safari Edventure did not disappoint. This was by far the most hands on experience we have ever had and to have that with wolves is incredible. Now, the experience is not a full day activity but for the $15.00 entrance fee (for Florida residents), the very informative interactive animal show (we held a boa, tarantula and alligator, pet a raccoon, sloth and possum) and all the animals that you see during your visit, it is worth every penny.  Also, it is a deserving donation made to a rescue that is helping out some pretty incredible animals."
"Those poor animals, heartbreaking!",March 2019,20,Safari Edventure,Stephanie C,"My youngest wants to be a vet when he is older so I try to find animal interaction opportunities for him whenever we travel.  He actually chose this activity out of the two I presented him with because of the wolf interaction.  We also got to hold a small alligator and a very large python during this visit which was pretty cool.  The animal interactions is what really attracts people to this place.  I will say that the guy who did the education piece was great!  However, the conditions are deplorable!  My heart broke for these poor animals kept in cages, some of which seemed to be falling apart.  As another reviewer stated, we also thought we had arrived to someone’s back yard with overgrown vegetation.  This place really just needs to be shut down.  I understand some amount of damage was done by a previous hurricane, but not likely enough to cause the conditions I witnessed today."
ITS Tour with Carlos,April 2019,50,Safari Edventure,Nikki H,"This was an amazing experience. We did the ITS tour with Carlos and it was worth every penny. Carlos was a wonderful guide. His love for the animals was heartwarming. You could see how much the animals  cared for him as well. I know this isn’t as modern as a typical zoo, but the intimacy and one on one interaction you get here is so much better. My husband and I fed foxes, lemurs, an alligator, emus, baby pigs, got to play with wolves, feed porcupines (insanely cute) and have up close time with the sloth (amazing life long dream). Carlos was super informative about everything and never made us feel rushed. After our tour we went the demonstration in the little amphitheater and we held a tarantula, baby gator, huge snake, petted and skunk and an opossum. The gentleman who did the presentation was smart and funny and we really had a great time doing that as well. Please don’t judge this place because if it’s out of the way location and somewhat ramshackle grounds. If it doesn’t smell prefect everywhere, remember there are animals EVERYWHERE and only a handful of people to get everything done. Instead of complaining about the appearance, donate to help them rebuild enclosures and continue to do the amazing work they do. I definitely recommend this experience for everyone. We will definitely be coming back with our family. ** ask for Carlos and tell him we said hi! "
Lots of room for improvement here,April 2019,40,Safari Edventure,steven0107,"If you can overlook the presentation of the cages, you will absolutely love this place.   "
Little Church in South Beach,January 2017,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,Yoly M,"Always a pleasure to enter this little Catholic Church in Souht Beach. While all is wild and crazy outside, inside you find peace and inner joy. A gem of a place of worship with lots of history. "
Nice church in South Beach,March 2017,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,The-Master-Planner,"We attended a Saturday mass here.  Beautiful, quaint church in South Beach within walking distance of many hotels on Ocean Drive near Lummus Park (it was roughly a mile from our hotel at 1400 Ocean Drive)."
A very welcoming Catholic Church in South Beach,April 2017,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,98philips,Attended Easter Mass.  Great attendance at mass.  Get there early.  Monsignor Vaughan is a great speaker.  Highly recommend attending mass there.
Beautiful church for a wedding!,May 2017,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,Jennylrad,"This beautiful, intimate, old-spanish style chapel was just perfect to host our wedding. Everyone complimented the setting, service, and magical feeling felt while they witnessed our marital union. The church fills with sound and acoustics and it quickly became a heavenly choir singing the praises of our holy union. We loved this church for our wedding and could not have found a more elegant and intimate church in Miami, period."
Great Church in Miami Beach,December 2016,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,jlsheff,"My daughter said at the end of the mass how she would like to get married at this church one day as she liked it there that much.  Time will tell, but next time we are in Miami Beach, I am going to carve time to go to mass at St Francis de Sales."
Cool place,September 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,raysantesso,"They have some games to play with friends, great staff and many food options! I loved it.."
Out of the house,September 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,Eduardo C,We went to visit this place my wife and my granddaughter and it turns out that we liked it so much that we told the family and now everybody want to go
Amazing Vodka Celebration,October 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,FraserRaterOfficial,"We went here for the vodka celebration, lots of vodka stations which were awesome. The open air venue had great views and chilled vibe. "
Sunday Funday,July 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,Paul S,This is a great place for Food and fun. You will enjoy sampling food from different vendors while listening to music on the bay. There is a huge bar with a lot to drink. there is also an area for kids.
YOU’RE VERY PRETTY,December 2019,50,The Wharf Miami,F8194UJkylec,"I met one of the bartenders on Wednesday night, I kinda forget what her name was, she was very pretty."
Jewish walking tour with Howard B.,March 2018,50,Jewish Museum of Florida - FIU,cure-searching,"excellent tour! would highly recommend it to all interested in the development/history of jewish settlement and community in south beach/miami beach. Howard is an excellent guide, welcoming and engaged, and obviously passionate about doing tours, and knows his stuff. Thanks to Howard, too, for making it as easy as possible for me to participate even though i am handicapped and depend on a walker. The museum is a gem too -- not my first visit and a wonderful hub and landmark."
Fun day,November 2019,40,Miami Seaquarium,CGait618,"Had visited this place over 20 years ago. Came back with our son, had a great time. Some facilities look like they have not been remodeled or touched since then, but overall we had a great time. The shows were great, and the weather was even better (no control over that). There’s a lot more food options now, not great, but will hold you up while you’re there!"
I'm an embarrassed Florida resident!,November 2019,10,Miami Seaquarium,joefunds,We took our visiting out of state relatives to this place. What a colossal ripoff! Few animals. Lame shows. Many of the food kiosks closed. Do NOT waste your money.
Dolphin encounter,December 2019,50,Miami Seaquarium,Zandcs,So incredible to encounter the dolphins in a way that you don't get to when seeing shows...
"Clean, nice play areas for children, good animal shows.",November 2019,30,Miami Seaquarium,Nancy M,There were a few play areas for the children which is probably the highlight. The shows that were open were very good and a perfect length for children. There was a lot of walking for the few animals. Way overpriced for what we saw.
Love this theater,November 2019,50,Colony Theatre,960samuelk,"Great venue. Friendly staff, amazing shows. Great location. Good vibes, Comfortable chairs = no brainer"
World class theater in South Beach,November 2019,50,Colony Theatre,Joanna H,There is not a time I travel to Miami without checking out the Colony. Productions are always world class and the surrounding areas make for an incredible night out full of culture and fun.
Cutural Getaways,October 2019,50,Colony Theatre,alepumar,"Florida is not only beaches and malls. There are many options for people like me: art and culture lovers. The Colony Theater is one of these options. They present a very well-curated season with exceptional actors and contemporary stories. In the summer there are a variety of shows in Spanish, also of the highest level. In front of the theater, there is an excellent Italian café where you can dine before or after with an art deco fountain that makes my ""cultural getaways"" a plan that I always repeat."
The future of theater in an art deco setting,November 2019,50,Colony Theatre,Rhausma,"Who would imagine that South Beach (in Miami Beach) would be home to a theater company that is creating brand new plays that it produces as world premieres. I have seen over half a dozen plays and each one is a gem. The ideal night out on an authentic Art Deco setting. And you can enjoy the scene on Lincoln Road, which is full of energy and cool places to eat or drink. Definitely, check it out. It will be memorable. "
Theatre,November 2019,50,Colony Theatre,mc_ramirezlugo,"One of the best artistic experiences in Miami, hands down. Premium quality theatre specifically catered to the Miami community but telling universal, important stories."
Needs to be reported ASAP,July 2019,10,Safari Edventure,Katelyn L,"Horrible horrible place- I wish i could give it zero stars. I honestly have no idea why this place has any positive reviews. I assume because it only cost $15 to get in and you can take pictures with animals. I was under the impression that this was a non profit and these animals were being rescued and helped. However, the animals at edventure safari are not being cared for properly AT ALL. Multiple wolves all kept in a small enclosure where they allow huge groups of people (including children) to go in and pet and photograph the WILD animals. The workers clearly are in no way animal experts nor did they know any information about these WILD wolves. One wolf didnt move the whole time and looked very malnourished and sick (they told me “oh hes just old”). The two year old wolf was trying to escape the whole time and deff needs a large space to run around. I wouldnt allow a small dog to be locked in this space much less multiple young wild wolves. Not to mention it is 100 degrees outside and many animals had no shelter. The aligators had no room to swim and all the cages were rusted,old and most covered in webs.Also many animals looked under fed and all had extremely dirty water. Many birds were missing most of their feathers. We didnt even look at all of the animals because after seeing the wolf enclosure I couldn’t bare to see anymore. I have been to other wolf sanctuaries in Florida and they all have acres of land for the animals to rome and live in packs. So i know there are much better places these wolves could go live. I also herd the “worker” saying they bred the wolves with dogs and sell the wolf dogs to people. These people are using these animals to bred and make money and do not care about their wellbeing. Someone needs to rescue these animals from this “rescue” ASAP."
Happy and relaxed Animals ,July 2019,50,Safari Edventure,stewcavan60,"We spent a whole day here and I must say people need to understand before judging this place. If you come here with a judgemental attitude then don't come at all. The animals here are rescued, rehabbed. Thanx to the lovely people here at the safari  that these little guys can finally escape the hell and hard life they came from. I always wanted to pet a wolf, and that came true while visiting here, the sloth and the possum are adorable as well. Big thanx to Carlos that explained us the story behind every enclosure, if you need more proof of how bad their life were before, they have lots of pictures you can go through. Thank you for taking care of them and keep doing what you do. Ya'll are amazing!"
Such a great find!,September 2019,50,Safari Edventure,jbarrette127,"We did the ITS tour, and it was excellent. Carlos was fantastic and very knowledgeable, and you can tell that the staff spend a lot of careful 1-on-1 time with each of the animals. That’s what sets it apart from a zoo, the animals seem genuinely cared about. So glad we made it here - highly recommended!"
Visiting from the UK,October 2019,50,Safari Edventure,Discover300565,"There was a show at the auditorium that was amazing. The lady was informative, without being boring and we got to touch / hold a skunk, snake, alligator, bullfrog, lizard, sloth and go in with the wolves too. A great way to spend a few hours and I would highly recommend a visit here"
BEST DAY EVER,October 2019,50,Safari Edventure,Lilly171969,"The place is amazing the caretakers are doing a great job. This is a none profit organization and they take care of this animals . Is not a fancy place and is not the zoo is for endangered species and animals that people take home and when they grow they cant handle them any longer and other wise have to be put down. There was a show at the auditorium that was amazing. The lady was great knowing everything about the little creatures. My granddaughter was so happy to get to see all this animals and touch them. Skunk, alligator, bullfrog,snake, lizard, sloth. Then they take you in to see the wolves and touch them. Pretty friendly except Athena she was not having it. Love the place...."
Beautiful church!,April 2018,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,rosannemtena,I always like to check out the local church when i travel And this church was perfect for me to walk to Sunday morning.
Beautiful small church,May 2018,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,Signaturehotelops,It was a quick uber ride from 1 hotel to an early mass.  The church is beautiful and the community was very welcoming to travelers.
Beautiful Church,April 2018,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,davidinarea,I attended daily Mass here very welcoming bi-lingual Mass the Church was beautiful inside and out the people were very friendly. this was walking distance from the beach and was in a lovely neighborhood. The Priest's homilies were very helpful.
Attended Saturday morning mass,August 2018,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,Jeannine H,"Positively beautiful!!!  Loved this church, the service and the people!!!! The mass times were perfect, parking was available. Just what we needed to start our week!"
Beautiful Saturday Evening Mass,October 2018,50,Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church,John S,"Attended the 6:00pm Mass on a Saturday night.  You have the warm welcome at the door, and the feel of an old Franciscan mission.  Eclectic mix of people.  Beautiful cantor and personable priest.  Uber gets you right there, and you're less than 10 minutes from Espanola Way!"
Not the Best ,September 2018,30,Fifth & Alton,jdwhu34,"Theres also a BK opposite, a Subway and a large Vitamin shop"
One of best stadiums I've been to,September 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,WhiteLightinX,"We went to the Dolphins vs Chargers game (Dolphins lost) When we arrived the car park as shown in the picture was full of pickup trucks and people had set up gazebos. It looked like a car boot sale with food and drink. A local fan explained this was the ""Tail Gate Party"" they arrived at family atmosphere, kids played games and everyone was friendly. The stadium was one of the best I have ever been to. Plenty of toilets no queues. Loads of food outlets, helpful staff. It is not a cheap day, tickets cost $50 dollars in the ""Gods"" to $500 plus. As the stadium is hosting the SuperBowl next year tickets will be between $5,000 50 over $20,000. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
Affordable shops,July 2016,40,Fifth & Alton,TravelerFever,Weather was extremely hot and humid. I needed  cooler dresses and this was the place for purchases. Close by in South Beach and prices were reasonable. A nice variety was available and I purchased two dresses which I still wear. I went back a second time and had lunch in this district and bought more clothes. 
Office Staff Dinner ,February 2018,20,Village of Merrick Park,nibaldom2015,"We had made reservations for our staff dinner. When we arrived we were sat promptly and the hostess was friendly and accommodating to our needs. That was the highlight. The waiter came over and we attempted to order wine. The first two bottles of Pinot Noir we tried to order they had run out. Then we ordered a cab which they were also out of. Finally they brought us something that they had, not really what we wanted but that was the best of all other choices. Others had some drinks and they were average at best. As for the food, two orders were brought incorrectly and the time it took to get our entrees were about 45 minutes. I had to ask the waiter why so long, and could not answer. I would figure if the restaurant was full but it was half empty. Overall, terrible experience would not recommend returning here. Enjoy."
Game On!,September 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,MLB4234,"I went at the Hard Rock Stadium to watch a football game, which team I was cheer for lose, but still had a great time. The Stadium provided a lot of security and guest service assistance, which I did not need but all around (Thank You). The pre-game shows and activities before the game was good. The seat location (Lower Level) was a good view for me and staff in the area was helpful, excited and happy."
Very nice to enjoy on Sundays with the family,October 2017,50,Village of Merrick Park,GabyP933,"Beside that it is very beautiful. It has different options to eat to go to movies, to shop (very expensive) and to meet with friends."
"Amazing Miami open grounds, maybe good for football ",March 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,natewb17,"Even though the primary event/events at Hard Rock are football games for the Miami Dolphins, the tennis tournament “The Miami Open” was GREAT!! The facilities were nice and you could get semi-close to the players. Only complaint is that there were few places for food so lines EXTREMELY long, but for a first year of a tournament and for a tennis tournament in general — great job! "
"No the Cleanest Beach, and Homeless Sleeping there.",March 2016,40,Collins Park,KeboDC,"Awesome sunrise, but the trash (mostly cigarette butts) to be fair they were doing a clean up. In one little strip there was 4 Homeless or maybe passed out on Spring Break. "
Tour of the Frank Gehry New World Symphony Building,March 2015,50,New World Symphony,wallacksjudith,"In addition to being architecturally beautiful, the history and purpose of the New World Symphony Orchestra and School is fascinating. They offer an outstanding professional education to a small, very elite group of musicians. However, the highlight was our tour leader, Dolly, who was both informative and extremely funny! We all laughed our way through the 45 minute tour, and I doubt any of us will ever forget Dolly. I know she does the Tuesday 4:00pm tour and believe she also does one midday on Fridays and Saturdays. If you're going to Miami, don't miss her!"
My favorite shopping experience ,May 2017,50,Village of Merrick Park,Carmen P,"This is a beautiful setting for shopping, dinning & movies. I visit frequently, my favorite Nordstrom store is there. This facility is open air, & has beautiful garden which is frequently used by families w small children who play around the fountain. There are several restaurants, some open air, around the garden, in a laid back casual environment. The restaurants are medium priced, the shops, some of well known designers, are expensive, the theater on the 3rd floor is very nice, it has casual dinning & the seats in the theater are recliners. Great place to spend an afternoon in Miami."

Always interesting events take place here,December 2015,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,srakowski,Just went to Art Basel which is always an amazing fair. It is museum quality art under one roof.

Pokemon Go hot Spot in a relaxing park,September 2016,40,Soundscape Park,risitodeplata,"The kids wanted to go looking for Pokemon and we left for a walk.  we were going to a Pokemon gym and after fighting it they wanted to continue.  we noticed that the Soundscape park has several poke stops there.  When we arrived there were about 80 - 100 people there with the majority looking for Pokemon.  There was a few parents like me with middle school or younger kids, but the majority were late teens to 20's. Small groups and couples were the majority. The kids caught a lot of  Pokemon and there were multiple lures going.  The park has plenty of seating and the New World center is there.  If you want Pokemon this is a good stop or if you just want to relax.  A nice break from the hustle and bustle of Lincoln Road and only 1 short Block away."
Nice little contemporary art museum,January 2018,50,The Bass,PhilippeM10,"At walking distance froof the m Ocean drive, this is perfect if the weather is not so good and you love contemporary art. 10$ entry fee per adult. A visit can take about 1h30 of your time, The park in front of the museum in very nice and is surrounded by other nice Art deco buildings. You can have a bite and relax in the interior space after your visit. "

1st time in South Beach,September 2014,40,New World Symphony,Sue B,"Did not go in, building and grounds impressive and Wednesday evenings they show a film on the building for anyone to watch"
Great place to hangout,July 2018,50,Calle Ocho,RanjanDutta,You cannot miss the giant roosters. Good place to take a stroll and experience the local culture and cuisines. Try the local ice-cream shops.
Interesting Small Museum in Miami Beach,November 2017,40,The Bass,238MikeS,The Bass is an interesting small museum with very friendly staff. It has a mixed collection including some very nice 16th - 18th century paintings and other objects in a somewhat whimsical display setting. There were several large contemporary exhibits upstairs as well.
"A great way of spending at least half a day with your kids in a ""museum""",November 2017,40,Miami Children's Museum,IMAJonTour,"With a 2 and an 8 year old one, it isn't always easy to find something which ""works"" for both. As our son said at the end of the day: ""It was really fun, in the beginning I wasn't sure but there was lot's of things I still was able to do!"" That's our 8 year old one. I would suggest, the museum is perfect for kids until 5 - 6. But still, when 8 you will still find things to do. Except the playground, everything is indoor. Nothing really, where you child get's wet, so no need to bring extra clothing, even water proofed jackets are available for some of the activities. If you have been to the children museum in Vancouver, you will find this museum smaller but it is still big enough to spend 3 - 5 hours here. By than, your child is ready for a break. Lot's of interaction, learning by doing and hands on equipment. We all had fun and it was a great attraction. One thing you need to consider: 20 USD per person plus 1 USD per hour parking. There is a Subway attached as a ""food"" option but there are as well picnic areas outside, if you prefer to bring your own food. Enjoy and have fun."
Beautiful,September 2017,50,Venetian Pool,saritasiman,"This is a made of coral and is fed by spring water, cold but refreshing.It has a cafeteria. It is a great place to take the children,has nice white sand for them to play It is in Coral Gables that in itself is a very nice city."
Attended the ABC continuity forum,December 2013,50,New World Symphony,anabellepaulino,Attended  the ABC continuity forum and it was the first time I was in there! The place is beautiful. The stage was set for speakers like Adrianna Huffington and more and the catered lunch food was delicious.
Orange Bowl Catstrophe,December 2018,20,Hard Rock Stadium,366ScottB,If you read other reviews you will find the same. But there is no way to describe the level of disorganization and under disrespect for those who attends the event by whoever is in charge.
Closed for renovation but looking forward to the opening,October 2015,50,The Bass,MDR2100,I have seen some top notch exhibitions of important Art over the years. The last I remember was Picasso's sketches. Long before wonderful Art Basel Miami Beach was lucky to have this gem of a museum.
The msueum of art,May 2016,50,The Bass,buddhakouri,"The Bass Museum is a modern building built in 1960s and renovated from the inside out as a masterpiece. The museum has lots of the finest arts designed by world famous artists. There are classes where you can make your own art. You can request a tour guide or come here with your family, friends or even your school if you live in Miami. "
PICTURE PERFECT,September 2016,50,Venetian Pool,Heloisa M,"A huge Venetian style swimming pool made of coral. Worth visiting, swim, getting a tan or rent for a party."
Jr lifeguard Summer camp & tennis camp,August 2017,10,Venetian Pool,ERMCoralGables,A beautiful historic landscape in a beautiful city that is poorly serviced at best and horribly mismanaged.   The staff are the reason this review reflects a poor experience on what is such a special place.  Specifically those employees affiliated yo the summer camp programs.  The children attending are neglected and left to their own devise.   Be wary of the Jr. Lifeguard summer program and tennis splash camp.
Adorable!!!!,June 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Agui_11,"I just loved this place. Nice shops open air shopping, both high fashion brands and some others like anthropologie or j crew. Great dinni g options!!! Villagio great italian food!"
Lovely views,September 2017,30,Bayfront Park,Reasonable50,"The park's location is rich in history. The view of the bay and port is impressive. The park itself is not very green, with a lot of concrete and benches. There were a few homeless sleeping the day I walked the park, but I felt safe and unharrassed. Typical of a big city park. Free transportation is close....the Trolley and Metro."
Work in art ,February 2015,50,The Bass,enatnj,"Worked an event there and it was pleasantly nice. With a few more adjustments that they are currently working on, I imagine they will reopen with a bang. "

Rip off,June 2017,10,Venetian Pool,Firemedic0822,"Honestly if you are a coral gables resident I can see how this place would be a great choice for you local pool but for someone who isn't a resident this place is way overpriced.  I would have gave it 3 stars but for the price.....got it a 1 star rating.  $50 for my daughter who is 7 my son who is 3 and me just for admission.  The amenities are ok.  Just a big pool with decent scenery.  The pool is run by a bunch of kids.   I think the oldest employee I saw there was maybe 28 and he seemed to be one of the head lifeguards.  Between my girlfriend her two kids, me and my two kids plus food we spent over $150.  Pretty  ridiculous.  Oh and don't get me started on the food line.  It took 30 minutes to get through the line of 7 kids in front of us.  Save your money and go to the Biltmore Hotel for a nice pool or CB Smith park for a great small water park. "
Great performance space,January 2014,50,New World Symphony,Trvllnglght,Beautiful concert hall with young musicians and a diverse repertoire. There is 360 degree seating and projection walls.  It was a unique and entertaining way to see and hear classical music.
Great for walk and relax!,July 2017,40,Bayfront Park,camilf_mia,And if you want to shopping or eat something........Bayside is right next to it!
Pretty place,June 2017,50,Bayfront Park,edmari d,Nice place to chill out fir a while... good food good music not enoght bathrooms but nice and clean going back again
What a gem in the middle of South Beach,February 2015,50,Lik Miami,SimonT720,Her knowledge of Peter's work is second to known and she is such an asset to the gallery 
Miami Beach or Miami B....??,May 2014,20,Miami Beach Convention Center,Stephanie T,"So  as far as the title of this review goes, Miami Beach or Miami B...., well I will take Broward County."
Pretty cool,March 2017,40,Monkey Jungle,thetravelinman1,"Lots of primates and wildlife.  Can get close to the animals and feed them.  If you want to get extra close and play with them/feed them/it'll cost you an extra $90 a person, which I thought was a little steep.  But still a good way to spend a morning or afternoon while in the area if you like this kind of thing."
Old South Florida,December 2016,50,Deering Estate,Arthur T,A trip back in time. Beautiful grounds and views of the bay. Best time to visit is during the annual Seafood Fest. Lots of activities and great local seafood. Always a good idea to have the DEET at the ready as the skeeders  can be brutal.. 
Inexpensive Park on the water,December 2016,50,Deering Estate,Heidi1226,"The Deering Estate is a quiet little park on the open water.  View the home of the Deering family, or walk through the park and enjoy the wildlife and beautiful palm trees.  They are only open from 10am to 4pm, but makes for a good weekend visit.  They offer events throughout the year to check out - live concerts, bird walks, kayak trips and etc.  A very enjoyable place to visit for a relaxing afternoon."
"Beautiful landscape, grounds",February 2017,20,Deering Estate,annde305,"I have visited often for the views of the outside grounds and also many events.  Building interiors not so interesting but outside (especially in the back) the grounds and view are breathtaking.  Event of Feb 14, 2017 though was totally disappointing.    Entertainers were NOT good.  From previous events I had expected a good show. Entertainers, sad to say, performed as if it was their first performance.  Music did not fit the occasion. Had high expectations, received poor entertainment. Definitely not up to The Deering Estate's reputation and past events.  "
Cool and Classic,February 2017,40,Venetian Pool,ethan l,"We were in Miami/Coral Gables and killing a little time while waiting for a dinner reservation at the Biltmore. The Miracle Mile was packed so we went by the Venetian Pool. Really cool but a little expensive if you just want to walk around for a bit. That being said, it is quite the experience and I recommend it to anyone visiting the area. However, I would try to make a day of it as opposed to just a quick stroll around."
See the Building!,April 2013,30,New World Symphony,eccentricbob,The new building is something to see even on the outside. Sometimes there is a free simulcast outside in the connected park area. A must see area near Lincoln road
Visitors and locals should all visit the New World Center,August 2013,40,New World Symphony,CONCIERGE_NAVIGATOR,"Visitors and locals should all visit the New World Center, home of the New World Symphony. An architectural wonder and state of the art facility with an impressive mission statement. Tours are offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They last for about 30 to 45 minutes for a small fee of $5 per person."
Great place to lay back have a few drinks.,December 2015,50,Village of Merrick Park,AlexA741,"Here at Merrick Park, there are many great restaurants like The Yard house. You will be able to enjoy Drinks, great food and Music. You also have a great deal of other restaurants around the area, and many shops to walk around after a few drinks."
"Loving the new ""Rock"" to enjoy the Canes' games",September 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,SoFlanestorz,"As season ticket holders see have seen the transformation of..Joe Robie, Pro Player, Land Shark...lost count. Hope it stays as the Hard Rock for years to come. They have  greatly improved the seats, concessions & club level seats. The staff it s very friendly with everyone and helpful to guide folks around."
Need Cigars?,November 2017,30,Calle Ocho,lisadZ9727KY,"If you need cigars, or have a burning desire to watch older folks play dominoes, this is the place to go to. Otherwise, not much to see here as far as I could tell. "
You Can Park Here,May 2017,40,Bayfront Park,luckyj_12,Bayfront Park is located adjacent to Downtown Miami abutting Bayside Marketplace. Quiet park with amazing views of the bay.
A Cultural Changeup,November 2017,40,Calle Ocho,whoopee,Nice but short immersion into the Cuban culture.  A proud people. Some nice ice cream and coffee shops as well as cigar specialty shops.
Tourist area for food and tours,June 2017,30,Bayfront Park,72SJMC72,"A nice enough area and great for simple burger food, tourist tat, and getting all tour or two.  Not amazingly pretty park area but well looked after. Some good live music and dancing, and lots of buzz so nice to wonder along beside the water. Lots of restaurants and shops. "
nothing worthy,February 2015,20,The Bass,yannoma,"gold???  Marino, and a super mini permanent exhibition ... i wonder why you call this a museum to my additional disappointment about my miami the bass museum was the top, well a visit is ok if you had enough of sunbathing ...... "
Always amazing during art Basel week,February 2015,50,The Bass,147rjd,Always amazing things here. Be sure to go and see the great works and artists featured during the art Basel week. Or just after as the artwork stays for a whole 
Kids fun,February 2016,50,Miami Children's Museum,buddhakouri,"Kids can do everything they want here and have fun with games to play, rides, and children's activities. This is a great place to bring your children. Perfect for all ages too. "
Best combination of fun and learning for kids!!!,December 2016,50,Miami Children's Museum,KASingh,"My four-year old loved this museum... she went to every section twice. The concept of the museum combines learning with fun. The museum is divided into sections where kids can learn about their world : going to the grocery (they can their own shopping and checkout), the bank, different types of energy : solar, heat, water, ), the thomas and train exhibit, construction, under sea adventures, going on a boat. The most exciting thing is that whereas in a typical museum you just observe, in this museum there is a lot of activities involved for smaller children including drawing and crafts, touching, playing. The volounteers were also very helpful and pleasant. If you have a very curious child like mine, prepare to stay for hours there :)."
Great place to keep your babies busy but lack of food.,January 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,Yaroslaw_Kerget,"Great place to go with your kids to keep them busy at least for 4-5 hours, you can easily spend here that much time. We used to visit with our son who is 2 years and 2 month and he was really happy and it was a lot of fun for him. The only one reason I give 4 stars to that place is there are no other place instead of Subway to feed your kids, I think it should be more variations of food, and Subway is not the healthy way to feed the toddlers."
Lots of fun,January 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,psmaia,"Really nice place for kids, we stayed there for like 4 hours, the kids were having fun all the time. Many educative toys, things to touch, to feel, to listen, music, books, sports. I just recommend to check if there will not be any school at the day. Schools have lots of kids which kind of monopolize the rooms, which is not so great. Specially in my case, where my kids don't speak english. Food is also something not very nice."
A great place for kids to explore their dreams!,March 2016,50,Miami Children's Museum,Jose R,Kids can play and explore all their soul's desires. It is certainly a must do with the kids. What a better way to get them even more excited about school! That alone is worth the trip! 
A gem on the north end of South Beach,February 2015,50,The Bass,37thgetaway,Contemporary exhibits in an older art deco building.  There was just enough to see without being overwhelmed.  The grounds featured sculpture as well. Paid $8. admission.
Lovely museum,February 2015,50,The Bass,MAVEN2148,Several very good temporary exhibits: I saw the Gold exhibit and the Peter Marino. Both were very impressive and informative. The setting is very attractive and the outdoor sculptures were great. So glad I visited.
Fresh look at contemporary,March 2015,40,The Bass,pjsVenice,It's a nicely done small museum with nice park like grounds. The exhibit was well done  and enjoyable. Enjoyed the sculptures on the grounds out front also. Staff was a bit detached when selling us the ticket.
cool place to hang out,December 2016,50,Bayfront Park,madiestan,"fun, and walk friendly which is rare in miami... water front seating area, where you can watch the boats and harbour and the miami cruises leave... lots of shops, restauarants and plenty of places to roam around the sea front.."
Awesome place!,April 2017,50,Bayfront Park,AmarylisTN,"Located next to the Intercontinental Hotel, so it  it is convenient.  Lots of restaurants and great place to people watch.  It is very clean and has a great garden area.  Homeless people do sleep there at night, but no problems."
Nice park with good skyline views.!!,June 2017,50,Bayfront Park,ishang2013,This park is primarily famous for events so you got to be prepared for parking nearby beforehand. You can visit this park anytime of the day to relax and njoy some really good views of miami downtown highrise n the bay .
"Great street to walk, and watch all Cuban, and Latin American activities....",December 2017,40,Calle Ocho,lolinstar,"Enjoy the best Cuban Restaurants, cafes, music, stores, markets, art galleries, murals, cigars, whatever you are looking for, even a Domino Park.... and there are Festivals in this street, too.  "
A must if you are visiting Miami!!!,October 2017,50,Calle Ocho,GabbyMich2016,Calle Ocho takes you to a little bit of Cuba. From the cigar rollers to the music in the street. You can get souvenirs or grab a mojito or two at the Ball and Chains! Watch salsa dancers and maybe dance a little if you can move your hips lol.
If you really have nothing to do or if you wish to buy cheap gifts,December 2017,30,Calle Ocho,TravelF0rW0rkAndFun,"If you have a few hours of nothing to do, this is a place where you can spend time walking on a street with dozens of cheap restaurants, cigar shops, a few turist traps. Not a very clean place. Old folks playing dominos or walking down the street. There is a Dollar Tree store where you can buy anything for a dollar. You can talk to people and find out about their lives back in Cuba if you are interested."
Great Stadium,September 2018,40,Hard Rock Stadium,Anthony D,"Caught a Dolphin game on their home turn for the first time and it was great. We had seats on the corner of the end zone with a great view of the field. Plenty of food options in the stadium, but I didn't see much outside due to the residential area. Parking looked like a mess, but we Ubered in and out without much hassle. I hope to get back there soon."
Taylor Swift Reputation Tour,August 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,giavannapic,This was the best exit I've ever had out of a stadium after a concert. It took a quarter of the time it takes to get out of most stadiums after shows. I was really impressed!
What an experience,September 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Philip M,I watched he Miami Dolphins play the Raiders (28-20 to the fins). The stadium is so good. Staff so helpful and friendly and loads of food and drink to choose from. Amazing venue.
this sucks for college games,September 2018,20,Hard Rock Stadium,jrios4444,"the way the stadium sets up for college is totally wrong they amplify the sound of music constantly and it takes away from the college experience for the fans , they forget we are not there to hear guns and roses or hip hop we want to hear the sounds of the bands the student the refs the mascot etc.. also the pricing for food and beverages is the same as the pro games, exp 5 dollars for bottle water is ridiculous 12 dollars or more for a beer is also sick not to mention the price of food"
Worth a visit,February 2016,40,Village of Merrick Park,IngridHA1973,If you are on a budget you can't buy anything here.  There are mostly expensive-high branded stores. But you have VS and others that you can get some good deals.  It is a beautiful open mall in a high class neighborhood
Shopping in the City Beautiful,February 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Robert D,A shoppers delight... a day at the Village Of Merrick Park will not be your typical shopping experience the beauty & surroundings will enhance your experience &  your tastebuds will thank you  
Great place to shop,February 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Donna B,I go here whenever I am in Miami. It's beautiful and the stores are fabulous. Free parking in the garage if you get your ticket stamped. 
Very pleasant place - a little bit hidden...,February 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,isabellgrh,"Hidden in a block of houses you are suddenly standing in an open more or less park surrounded be very nice and luxury boutiques (Tiffany, H.Stern, Diane v Furstenberg, Nordstrom, ....) and restaurants. Not all of the restaurants are high-priced. So even if you don't want to go shopping, just sit down and watch the scenery!"
amazing!,October 2012,50,New World Symphony,ClaudiaG0mez,"my daughter and I caught an outside concert, everyone took chairs, towels and enjoyed a free concert."
Great events,March 2013,50,New World Symphony,Roger S,Some great addition to South Beaches usual lack of cultural experience. Modern DJ's mix with classical music - very cool. 
2013 ABC Continuity Forum,November 2013,50,New World Symphony,wearecured,"I attended the 2013 ABC Continuity Forum at the New World Symphony building designed by Frank Gehry. What an amazing place with wonderful staff, beautiful views, and an amazing outdoor area. You should make your way over to this amazing center if you are in the area!"
Beautiful setting!,June 2016,50,Venetian Pool,MjM247,"The pool was created in 1923-24 from a coral rock quarry, where much of the original coral rock was used to border and accentuate the pool. It was part of the Grand Plan George Merrick had for the City of Coral Gables. I started going as a teenager and went back with my children years later. It is always a magical place to swim."
More than a pool!,August 2016,50,Venetian Pool,oibarra3, It is truly an unforgettable experience!
Adorable but under construction ,March 2017,40,Venetian Pool,JulieSJulieS,Got a decent peek at this.  It was great to see it without people there but did not get a full sense of its wonder.  So glad to see they have renovated it to keep it functional.  Truly lovely! 
Recovery heaven,April 2017,50,Venetian Pool,Monty319er,I came down to Coral Gables to visit my parents after my IRONMAN RACE in Haines city. Decided to relax and recover at Venetian pool. It was the perfect temperature to take a short swim to workout all my tight muscles. The water fall did wonders on my tense neck as I let the water massage my neck and back muscles. Just relaxing under the palm trees after my swim was wonderful. The little sand beach is a added bonus to this already unique pool. Not having chlorine in the pool was a plus! Can't wait for my next visit.  The price of admission can come down but otherwise it's a great spot to visit. 
"Rare, Beautiful Old Florida",February 2017,40,Deering Estate,Kathy H,"This historic estate brings you right up on the bay with ocean breezes and gorgeous Royal Palms. Just when you can't take the claustrophobia of Coconut Grove another minute, drive down here for some fresh air and a taste of another era. The grounds are beautiful, the houses are nice to walk through. $12 per person for either self tour or guided tour (about an hour)."
"Small place, nice architecture",June 2016,30,Deering Estate,EliteTraveler0304,"If touring you don't need more than an hour here, it does have nice architecture and landscape but it is not near anything and I would recommend Vizcaya Gardens prior. This is nice on the water as well but not as big or grand as Vizcaya. "
You have to feed the monkeys,April 2016,40,Monkey Jungle,Amanda D,"This place is expensive because they cater to and care for the monkey's here. Their enclosures are huge, and very fitting in regards to truly giving an animal a worthy captive life. For this, I can overlook the price. For many, what can only make it worth it is experiencing what I described above. Which was for both me (animal lover) and my husband (not so much) a truly fun and amazing experience. Don't forget to take video and pictures, especially if you have kids."
Great for our 11- and 15-year olds,March 2017,40,Monkey Jungle,REDHOG,"I agree that it is expensive, but totally worth the visit. Do the guided hands-on feeding inside the rain forest. Extra money, but really worth it."
I was hesitant and I LOVED this place,March 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,schlegal1,"I was hesitant to come here because I don't much care for zoos. I really didn't want to see a situation where animals were living in bad conditions. We went to ZooMiami last year and I absolutely hated it. But this place is small and family run. The primates get good attention and care and loads of free range space. The environment is similar to their natural habitats and all of them (except the oran and gorilla) get time to amble about in the acreage. The oran and gorilla, which I would usually hate to see in captivity, are there because they cannot live elsewhere with other apes or in the wild (the gorilla, King, had his teeth pulled out by a circus years ago). So this place operates as a sanctuary for the primates (and many birds) that cannot live elsewhere."
"Hey, Hey We're the Monkeys!",March 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,NLWalsh,Over the top caring staff made this trip worthwhile. We went at 3pm and made it to 3 of the shows. We have a service dog. The monkeys are threatened by dogs so they made arrangements for our dog to stay in the office while we visited. You can tell the staff loves working here and they care about the animals. Around 4pm is feeding time and we loved watching the tortoises and rhino iguana getting fed a big salad. You should bring quarters to buy sunflower seeds for monkeys who will pull up the chain operated dumb waiter with the seeds to eat. King is the silver backed gorilla who is very picky about his iced-tea and loves Ellen D see YouTube!
Art Basel Week,December 2013,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,Kathryn W,"You must come with us to Art Basel Miami week at least once in your life.  The art is amazing, and you are the first of your friends to experience it, as New Yorkers usually have to wait until July for the Scope Art week."
Very hard to find parking,December 2013,20,Miami Beach Convention Center,missiel D,"I work there for a little while and always had such a hard time to find parking. It  will literately make my morning miserable. I suggest if any one s heading there leave early, you'll need at least 30 minutes to loose driving around to find a decent parking space."
Nice Meeting Location,December 2013,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,EK37334,"Easy to get too, nice open corridors, easy access to Lincoln Street for eating, what more could you want with the great weather?"
Great venue on a large scale,May 2014,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,C T,"Needs a little refurb to become more state of the art, but is great for major conferences and trade shows."
Peter Lik's Gallery,March 2015,50,Lik Miami,97LOL,"Beautiful and amazing gallery! Peter Lik's work is amazing, his photos will take you away to another place.  It is a gallery not to be missed.  "
Beautifull photos!!!,March 2015,50,Lik Miami,karlasuriel,When we strolled down through Lincoln Road we noticed the pictures and couldnt resist going inside. We where greeted by an awsome guy that gave us a lesson on peter lik's history and showed us the way light affects the picture. If you're around please stop by. You wont regret it
Photos of one of the best photographers,May 2015,40,Lik Miami,TyN_13,"It's a place you need to visit when you have the chance, it's overwhelming what one can do with talent and techniques and show places in this wonderful way."
Always visit when in Miami,April 2015,50,Lik Miami,Merrigypsy,Love Peter Lik's photography.  We have visited several of his galleries every time we are near one.  One day I will own one!
"Expensive, plastic and simple experience",February 2017,30,Miami Children's Museum,l5antti,"We spent 3,5 hours inside and that was enough. I would say this museum is not worth of money. But in rainy day it's one of expensive choices to spend day inside."
Good plan for families with kids,June 2016,50,Miami Children's Museum,pschedar,Off course this place is for families with littles children. Perfect for a rainy day in miami. Without beach it's a good option for kids
"Wonderful place, but better for kids over 5. A bit pricey as adults pay full fare.",March 2017,40,Miami Children's Museum,Ive I,"try to avoid the days they have school visit, because i had the experience and its a bit crazy! specially because the kids are bigger and as i had a small kid he was pushed and i had to keep an eye and talk to their scorts to pay attention."
Fun fun fun,March 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,globtratta,"Remote control boats, public store, emergency room, fire truck, cruise ship, and so much more.  If your kids need a break from the beach or high-end shopping this is the place.  Hours of things to do.  "
A fun day for everyone!,March 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,Angelrose1327,Cafeteria onsite. Easy parking. This museum it's huge and have too much for our children to enjoy! 
What would you expect?,February 2015,10,The Bass,Knownews,"The infrastructure is great, but the content is laughable.  So small you can see everything in less than 15 min."
Closed untill october 2016...,June 2015,30,The Bass,Bornabrit,"walked to this museum only to find that it is  closed for renovation, the small park in front of it seems to be a new home for quite a few home less people sleeping under the trees...but there are a couple of sculptures in front ."
Fantastic,December 2014,50,The Bass,Vonschmidt,"The grounds are amazing, the building a treat and the art simply fantastic. Great job to the staff and to the city "
I like it,June 2015,50,The Bass,sven-thomas-t,Small museum with interesting exhibitions. Currently closed to get revamped until fall. Mummy. In South Beach across the W.
Do not miss when it opens again,May 2015,50,The Bass,Paula R,My husband and I visited this museum before it closed .It really was a great experience to see this small special place.The show we saw was Peter Marino called One Way.The show explored the renowned American architects multifaceted relationship with art.Very created show.The rooms filled with interesting photos and art.One room was very special because it had Opera.We sat down and heard and saw opera singers on the walls.It was very special.When the museum opens again do not miss it.
so-so,July 2017,30,Bayfront Park,ronawelly,"I visited the place because I saw its pictures on a web. Honestly, nothing special in my opinionm but, there are a few spots from where you can take a few nice pictures."
Breathtaking Bayfront,July 2017,50,Bayfront Park,Y3240QPmarkb,"Another beauty in the vibrant city that is Miami. This well kept park is stunning to walk through, relax and photograph. With many well known restaurants, bars and great night spots adjacent, it truly is a beautiful bay."
Pretty and clean public park by the water!,August 2017,40,Bayfront Park,captaincook2014,- Don't come expecting a signature landmark or a wow-worthy moment. It's a clean and pretty park that lots of locals spend time in.
Over-rated,January 2018,30,Calle Ocho,pavakeal,"Nothing special about the area and rather dirty. Usual fast food diners and a few Cuban cafes cum bars. There was an air of touristic hopefulness but without some serious product definition, the area is not worth the effort to visit."
5 photos and goodbye,January 2018,30,Calle Ocho,Mogeltoft,It certainly isn’t Cuba and the real Havana - it’s just a street with Hispanic names in Miami.
Fun to walk around,December 2017,50,Calle Ocho,SheemaE,Fun walking area with tons of nice shops and restaurants.  What amazed me was the people working the area do not have I-got-to-sell attitude at all.  Very friendly and nice.   Nice row of mini studios will open new shops across the Ball and Chain. 
Worth a look,January 2018,30,Calle Ocho,BunnyBabz,We nipped here on the bus from downtown. Stayed about an hour and half. Fun vibes good place to grab a mojito and listen to some live music during the day but that's about it really. 
"Good food, dodgy neighbourhood",January 2018,20,Calle Ocho,Y3615BW,Apart from the two cuban food institutions located in this street (Versailles and La Carreta) there seemed to be nothing special in the area.  I'd keep away unless you are craving for cuban food.
Fantastic venue for home or away fans,October 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,DAH204,I’d recommend a trip to any NFL game at this amazing stadium.
Pretty Good Stadium For Its Age.,October 2018,40,Hard Rock Stadium,bilyclub1,"Arrived at the G cash parking lot at about $10:30 by taking the Turnpike down from Lauderdale. Parking is $40. but if you have a Sunpass the fee is only $25 charged to the Sunpass. Very easy getting in and tail gating was going strong in the very hot parking lot. Decided to head in 11:30 ish. There are  2 roads in between the parking lot and the stadium which caused minor delays getting to the other side of the road. Why there aren't pedestrian bridges are tunnels to ease the vehicle and people traffic is kinda stupid. Once at the NorthEast Gate things went smooth. The bag checks were smooth and fast. The actual ticket takers are turnstile machines with code readers.  All the levels have escalators to make the trip up easy. Once up on the 300 Level there was a spacious breezy deck due to the recent  rehab job.   Sitting in Section 218 was great and the whole stadium appeared to have great sight lines.  Overall  I thought the place was great. Now the minuses. There are not nearly enough monitors in the areas under the stands. The lines at the concessions and restrooms were pretty long. It also seems that a lot of the locals buy the cheapest tickets they can and then sit in better seats until the valid ticket holder show ups. This is very annoying and reminds me of a game of musical chairs. Finally, I'll mention  that they sell the souvenir cup for soda with unlimited refills, just like Tampa. "
Pre-buy parking,October 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,817susannem,"If attending a Dolphins game, you should drive to the stadium a day before to buy a parking ticket, cause it's about half the price (25 $) than on gameday (40 $). "
"Love it, Fins Up!",October 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,blairf696,"My goodness, the Dolphins sure do know how to put on a football game.  Nothing compares, it's a total party and everyone is cool and laid back.  "
Lions bs Dolphins,October 2018,30,Hard Rock Stadium,G2746CYmichaels,Stadium was great. Too a lift in and had to make a short walk. Problem and I do mean BS the directions to ride share are confusing and not correct. Police stop Uber and lift drivers for the benefit of cabs. Who takes a cab anymore really. Had to walk at least a mile to get access to a lift. What a away to wreck a good day we had at the game. Simply stated worst experience ever getting out of a stadium!
Beautiful open space mall.,May 2015,40,Village of Merrick Park,MoItaly,"Plenty of stores and restaurants as said, mostly upscale, but not snobbish like Bal Harbor. This is one of my favorite areas in Miami and of course my wife could spend a whole day in and out the stores..:)"
Good Ambient,April 2016,40,Village of Merrick Park,HAS17,The price was fair.
Good variety of eateries,April 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Jerry P,"A bit inland if you're a tourist on the beach, but worth the drive for a chance of pace.  Great eateries and shopping plus parking (not free) available.  For us locals its a great family, or date night get away."
Favorite shopping spot,April 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,love2travel0101,Merrick Park has become my favorite place in town. I come here very often with my family. It's a lovely outdoor mall with fantastic shops. 
Great shopping experience. ,May 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Marielam3c,"The village is beautiful, very well kept and clean. There's also a good variety of shopping/eating places. The Christmas tree lighting ceremony is a must. Thanks "
A true cultural asset for Miami,February 2014,50,New World Symphony,henryfogel,"The New World Symphony is a pre-professional training orchestra for young musicians, overseen and led since its founding by Michael Tilson Thomas. It is THE premiere such orchestra in America. But providing the young musicians a living stipend and free housing, and by providing the highest level of training and performance experience, the New World Symphony attracts the finest young musicians in American graduating from conservatories. The orchestra plays almost at the level of a great professional orchestra, and with an enthusiasm and emotinal involvement that can surpass professional orchestras. An all Tchaikovky concert heard on February 1, 2014, featuring the ""Pathetique"" Symphony, was a thrilling experience. Anyone who loves symphonic music, and who wants to experience the future of classical music in America, should see and hear this orchestra - particularly in their wonderful new hall."
A pearl in the middle of the chaos of SoBe,March 2013,40,New World Symphony,Redgravi,"totally recommend, specially to take kids to appreciate music."
Tour of the NW Symphony building,January 2014,50,New World Symphony,MaryGoody,Very interesting to learn the history of this group and see the inside of this magnificent building designed by Frank Gehry.  This is a gem in South Beach.  Tours are only offered on Saturdays and Tuesdays. 
Wallcast concert floored us!,March 2014,50,New World Symphony,ToddV_13,"Terrific weather, hotel towels as seating, and some of the greatest FREE music we've heard - Mozart and Vivaldi under the stars.  If you're visiting South Beach, check the calendar to see if they're doing this when you're in town."
Stay home :( ,June 2017,10,Venetian Pool,andreak1003,"We thought this place had some amenities or activities to justify a $50 admission (1 adult, 2 kids.) It was a cold pool with many camp kids and no alcohol ... horrible combination!! The scenery was pretty and the rocks were cool, but my community pool has that.  The best part was the pretty drive through coral gables. Worst part: the cost and concession stand that was so slow and unprepared that I needed a beer  to tolerate ... oh wait .... "
Excellent pool and waterfalls,June 2017,50,Venetian Pool,1817MaryannS,Absolutely beautiful pool. Loved the waterfalls. This pool fills early so get there early. At capacity a sign is hung up that the pool is full and you cannot enter. We looked through the fence to see it. Wished we could of swam there. An it expensive but on vacation worth it. 
Too late to swim ,June 2017,30,Venetian Pool,Ausecl,"Once the pool reaches capacity, it is closed. I appreciate the safety concerns for the guests. This is a beautiful pool built reminiscent of Venice with waterfalls and made to transport you away. It is beautifully landscaped and well supervised. The lines were long and it is a little pricey for a swim ($25-$35). "
BESTpool ever!,July 2016,50,Venetian Pool,Jewels417,"Haven't been in years since I no longer live in S.Florida. I grew up going to this pool, it is the best one I've ever been too. Beaches, cliffs, caves, picnic area and snack bar. Everything you need to have a great day at the pool. It doesn't even look like a pool, looks like an exotic lagoon..if you've never been, you need to check it out!"
Afternoon of Leisure,March 2017,40,Deering Estate,Angelo G,"Spent several afternoons at the Deering Estate.  Great place to tour the houses, spend the afternoon by the water drinking wine and snacks.  Great view of the ocean, historic house and enjoyable surroundings.  Don't miss the annual Seafood Festival and Jazz under the stars-great events."
Manatees and More,March 2017,50,Deering Estate,Spencer M,"This is a wonderful place to hike, see beautiful historic buildings and see Manatees in a man-made inlet.  Have a wonderful time exploring the estate grounds.  "
Beautiful tourist spot in coral gables,July 2016,50,Deering Estate,babansonia,Nice picture spot full of history. A gem in Miami. Fantastic home and surrounding estate is worth a few hours of exploration. A must do in Miami.
Poor man's Vizcaya,April 2017,30,Deering Estate,nancyolah,"One of the most interesting features was the basement wine cellar that was behind a bank vault door.  The 4000 bottle wine cellar was flooded by a hurricane in 1945, and the value door remained sealed shut for many years. The combination was finally broken in 1985 by a safecracker who was brought in."
Cute monkeys not worth the money ,December 2016,30,Monkey Jungle,LA9988,Very small jungle but the monkeys are very cute. It's overpriced for the facility and space not worth the admission fees. The baby monkeys are adorable though 
$$$$,April 2017,10,Monkey Jungle,TrvlLovrs,It's out in the middle of no where.
Feeding monkeys raisins is almost worth the price of admission,May 2016,40,Monkey Jungle,lymac7,"It is so much fun watching these monkeys drop dishes at you from above, asking for food. Put a few raisins in the dish and they eagerly pull the chain up, eat them, drop it back down, and shake it at you if you stop paying attention to them. They can't be fooled, though; put a non-food item in there and they won't touch it. There are some informative exhibits as well, such as King, the gorilla who loves to watch ""Frozen,"" and the feeding in which tons of monkeys come out and go into the water to retrieve hard boiled eggs, etc. Admission is steep, though, and the park is rather far off the beaten path."
"Monkeys, monkeys, and more monkeys",March 2017,40,Monkey Jungle,Lindabuslady,"Loads of fun,you are in the cage, monkeys are running around loose all around you. You can feed them."
Great time for the family,April 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,nick v,"Great place to get up close and personal with some very cool Monkey's.  My boys, 2 and 4 had a blast feeding the monkey's and running around the vast park.  The exhibits were great and the educational shows were actually fun.  You get to look around at your own pace and really just enjoy the animals in their habitat.  It's a great family adventure and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to experience something outside of your prototypical zoo."
Art Basel,November 2013,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,BigoBoca,One of the great art events of the world is held at this venue every December turning into one of the great museums of in the world. It's lacking some of the facilities other centers have. 
Miami Beach Convention Center,December 2014,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,387indy,"The location might be a little far from the airport, but that makes it nearer the Ocean. It is very big with many food spots, bathrooms and rest areas. The center takes on the show it is hosting, as the Boat show with it's outside and water, or the Automobile show. It's a good venue."
Art Basel - What else can you say,December 2014,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,Ron308,"The convention center is getting a bit long in the tooth, and could use some more restrooms. On the other hand, we were there for the Art, not the convention center. The CC is close enough to lots of hotels, big and small that you can walk, which is very nice."
International Motorcycle Show,January 2015,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,Luca R,I rate it 4 out of 5 because parking is not as good as it could be
80's Convention Center,January 2015,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,CuriousTravelerRadio,TIP: Walk 3 blocks to Lincoln Ave for lunch.
LOVED it,June 2015,50,Lik Miami,LenaA862,Great gallery - we stumbled upon it while we were walking on Lincoln Road. LOVE it - his work is absolutely stunning!  A very nice little detour
A definite stop on Lincoln Road!,June 2015,50,Lik Miami,KB4MIAMI,"Beautiful landscape photo gallery on Lincoln Road-- definitely worth a stop as you stroll by. A great place to loose yourself in every photograph. Peter is truly an amazing photographer, bringing light and depth to every scene from deserts to ocean views to deep wooded forests. This is definitely one place on Lincoln not to miss!"
AMAZING PHOTOGRAPHS,July 2015,50,Lik Miami,Donna C,"We went to get out of the heat (95 degrees) and we found this beautiful gallery with amazing photographs exhibiting the wonders of the world.  Worth stopping into the gallery, even in cool weather!"
High End Photography,July 2015,50,Lik Miami,fracolon,alone or with family it is a great getaway.
Meh,July 2015,30,Lik Miami,BellaPapaya,"Although the photos are spectacular, this wouldnt be a place for art lovers, as the presentation is a bit over-stating things. "
Amazing place for kids!,March 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,Maxable,My family had a blast here!  We could have stayed here for hours.  We came on a week day so it was full of school groups until lunch time.  
Awesome way to spend the day!,March 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,dolphanfan16,"Visited with my three kids, we all loved it! So much to see and do, and very reasonable priced. Great way to spend the day in Miami!"
An Absolut Great Place!!!,April 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,IvyFromPuertoRico,"Great place and Great price specially if you live in Miami or you are with someone that lives in Miami you will have your resident discount. My daughter enjoyed this place very much we walked every inch of it. She loved to fish, ride the fire truck and loved the supermarket and specially enjoyed being the cashier. Even us the adults enjoyed the place.  I highly recommend this place if you are planning to go to Miami with your children."
3 and 4 year old,May 2017,40,Miami Children's Museum,katatka,I would have given 5 star if it wasent for the stiff price 80 dollars for 2 kids and to adults. The kids loved it and we stayed for 5 hours.
Very interactive- Must go to!,December 2016,40,Miami Children's Museum,SV0710,"This museum is great in that it teaches kids about different professions and is very hands on with allowing them to explore the functions these professions do. It is almost a play ground within a museum. They have a small restaurant and gift shop, but the food is okay. Would eat elsewhere. Great activity for a hot day in Miami!"
Interesting if you haven't been to big museums before,October 2015,30,The Bass,grnfern,"This museum is worth an hour or so of your time.  Experienced museum goers may be bored.  There isn't that much available to view, a lot of the art is local artisans.  "
Under Renovation in 2016,December 2015,50,The Bass,Robert G,Located at 23rd Street and Collins Ave.... 
closed till fall,January 2016,40,The Bass,ClocloLuxembourg,"the Bass Museum, one go the centers of contemporary arts and the well known Art Basel-Miami, is being enlarged for the moments. Go for it anyway, and have a nice walk around the Collins Park where the Museum is situated. You'll find there a whole bunche of nice "
Great little museum.,February 2016,40,The Bass,Motherofchildren,This is a fun place for Art Deco fans to visit. They have some nice collections and the museum is small enough that you have time to see it and still get to the beach. 
Relaxing and cool,October 2017,40,Bayfront Park,David M,"So yeah spend some time here to relax cool down, and take in a sun set or two."
Beautiful views,September 2017,40,Bayfront Park,educatedsailor,Just wanted some alone time and this was a great spot to people watch and still be within earshot of the music in the mall.
Downtown Park,October 2017,40,Bayfront Park,478camen,"I liked everything about this park, it’s downtown along the bay near hotels, the metro mover stops, Bayside Market place and has lovely bay views - there’s a balance of concrete and green space to enjoy for joggers and walkers, the bay water views were relaxing and calming for me personally - park benches are scattered through and I thought the palm trees were a nice touch, we didn’t use the restrooms but they are there, small but great use of space."
Nice Walk with a little History,November 2017,40,Bayfront Park,Joe D,This was our first place to visit when we arrived in Miami. It was a short walk from our hotel. The scenery was good with the river walk or the bay walk. We learned a lot about the founders of Miami and would recommend it as the market and bus is all in the same area.
Yep.  Tick.  Done.,January 2018,20,Calle Ocho,TommoShelby,"Like so many of these places, worth a stop off on a sight-seeing bus but not worth the money or effort of a special trip."
Tamiami Trail,February 2018,30,Calle Ocho,laurelboo,"This is the oldest road in Miami. It is also called the Tamiami Trail. It is full of retro shops, and it’s just a fun drive."
"People Either Get It, Or They Don’t...",February 2018,50,Calle Ocho,Ralph d,Don’t be mislead... Take a TOUR and see for yourself why Calle Ocho is arguably the beating cultural heart of the City of Miami...!
This neighborhood is so much fun!,February 2018,50,Calle Ocho,carringtoneurope,"This turned out to be one of my favorite parts of my Miami Beach Vacation. It is filled with a lot of art, color, music and wonderful places to eat. I think the people here are very friendly and interesting. I wish I had time to visit in the evening because I'm sure it would have been even more lively but during the day, I still had a wonderful time."
Little Havana....,February 2018,40,Calle Ocho,chips57,"Now if you want a little of that Cuban culture feel with the food and the music and the shops, definitely go to Calle Ocho.  There is also a Domino Park where people sit at and play Dominos or chess in the day and have tournaments..of course there are Cuban cigar stores.  Night life is abundant and the music is loud and fun and people are in the streets and there is no place to park if you get there too late..it gets crowded at night on the weekend !  So I would definitely go out and explore in the day and maybe come back at night for a different flavor! "
Lions v. Dolphins,October 2018,40,Hard Rock Stadium,eileenv525,"Nice stadium.  We had access to the bars at ground level that we highly recommend.  One word of caution.  If you do not want to bake in the hot southern Florida sun, buy your seats on the Dolphins side of the field.  "
Stadium is very nice and easy to get around in.,November 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,JTHOMAS2003,If you are going get a parking pass ahead of time and it is simple once you are in to find a spot. The stadium is very nice with plenty of bathrooms and food places. It's not cheap but it's comparable to other stadiums as well. The seats are all good just be ready for the sun! The club level is good and you can usually find someone willing to part with their upgraded tickets to allow you to get up there. 
Bills at Dolphins game,December 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,SLW1020,If you are sensitive to heat be aware that the sun blazes on the visitors side- the stadium provides lightweight sun shields which are definitely helpful. One of my friends on the other side snuck a pic of me melting and using it to cover my head (not its intended use ). 
Bills vs Dolphins,December 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Michael M,"Very well organized stadium, not the newest but very comfortable, Very nice people helping you find your way."
"Great Stadium, but hard to get out",December 2018,10,Hard Rock Stadium,SharkPhin,"I surprised my wife for our anniversary, after our cruise, with tickets to watch her favorite football team, the Patriots vs the Dolphins.  The game was played at the Hard Rock Stadium.  It is a great venue, but the employees there need more training in location of there amenities.  We were looking for the ""main"" Dolphins store to purchase souvenirs.  The problem with that is we asked several employees how to get to it and were given the wrong location several times and a couple of employees did not know where it was located.  After doing a lap around the stadium and checking some of the smaller team shops, finally we found a younger Male employee who knew how to get to the main store.  After purchasing our souvenirs we proceeded to ""TRY"" and leave the stadium and make our way back to our hotel.  Again we asked employees where to go to catch a ride.  We were informed it is a 20mins walk to the end of the stadium in the ""ride share"" area.  We walked to this area then after talking to other spectators and finally being informed by an employee that we had to walk down the street and make a left turn as only taxis were allowed access to this location.  We started walking with other spectators to this location. After getting to this location and seeing that it was also blocked off by police/security.  Security officer told us we needed to walk farther just past an underpass then cross the street and wait by a school.  So now 1 hour after leaving the stadium and waiting and walking, we arrived at the school and saw at least 50 other people waiting for rides Lyft or Uber. Both companies increased their rates by up to 150%, very nice of them!!!  The first driver we called did not speak English very well, so after calling him several times and not being able to communicate with him, he decided not to show up because he could not find the pick up point.  This happened to several other people.  We had to call for another driver.  It is now dark out and this is not the best/safest area to be waiting.  A couple of guys came up to us and offered to drive us back to our hotel, we politely declined as they were not in a vehicle at the time.  A taxi driver offered to drive us for $100, over 3x times the cost of a Lyft or Uber.  Our driver finally showed up and we made it back to our hotel over 3 hours after the game had ended.  What should have been a fun experience was ruined by employees who need more training, the need for a ""marked"" and ""designated"" area for Lyft/Uber rides and ride share companies not raising prices by 150%.  Will not being going back to this stadium any time soon.  In hindsight, it might have been a better idea to drive to the game and pay the $33 parking fee, at least we would be in a vehicle and not waiting in a seedy neighborhood that is not well lite and hard to find for ride share drivers.  Would have taken pictures to submit, but I was on my phone..."
Great place to shop,July 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Bob T,What a treat!  Nice town feeling with great shops. Very convenient. The place has loads of clothing store stores and restaurants. The only down side is you have to pay for parking. 
Nice place to shop and dine,July 2016,40,Village of Merrick Park,daniela1217,"and stores as Neiman Marcus, William Sonoma. Life music on the outdoor garden."
Upscale Shopping,April 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,TourGuide-Manager,"Village of Merrick Park opened in 2002 with Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and a glittering collection of upscale, luxury retailers, fine restaurants and numerous international brands who chose to open their flagship stores here because of Miami’s diverse residential population and international tourist shoppers who embrace globally known brands. At Merrick Park you can find Flagship stores from Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Spain, Chile, Colombia, Italy and France."
Shopping and More,July 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,mrtymar,"Village of Merrick Park is an outdoor mall with upscale shopping and mainstream stores too. It's home to many restaurants, gyms, spas, etc. The only mall that my husband will accompany me to.  But one of it's best features is the architecture and landscaping  nestled in the beautiful landmark city of Coral Gables."
New World Symphony,March 2014,50,New World Symphony,Margaret D,"Absolutely amazing place to visit.  Just the architecture alone is amazing.  Didn't get to see a concert, but can imagine it would make Lincoln Center jealous."
Enjoy a Wall Concert under the palms.,March 2014,50,New World Symphony,Flo-NewRo,Wonderful concerts by members of America's graduate school of orchestral music. A beautiful building and innovation in concerts large and small. Inside with perfect acoustics or out with a picnic supper.
New World Symphony Visit,April 2014,50,New World Symphony,Thomas S,"The NWS is a fantastic organization which is making a statement to promote classical music as an attractive offering to more than just the traditional listener.  Our family traveled from Chicago to Miami Beach to hear the concert featuring the 4 winners of the annual concerto competition.  We sat outside with 1000 others for the Saturday night concert broadcast on a 100 ft high wall.  It was obvious that people came to meet and visit with others as well as hear great classical music. The same program was performed the next day inside the 700 seat facility.  The sound is crisp, and there is seating on all 4 sides of the orchestra.  The NWS is in the heart of Miami Beach, easy to get to, and worth a visit!"
Christmas Symphony,December 2013,50,New World Symphony,Cheryl D,"What a wonderful experience! The seating was great, the sound amazing and the Orchestra was on fire! I would definately do this again!"
Outdoor WallScape concerts,March 2014,40,New World Symphony,ABClady,"Free tickets for indoor concerts but free outdoor concerts are great and they also have evening outdoor free movies.  Just pick your performance carefully, as this is ultra modern music most of the time."
Amazing and Beautiful Swimming Pool,August 2017,50,Venetian Pool,JPA1403,A great place to spend the day. Beautiful swimming pool with caves and cataracts. Pool attendant are good and attentive. Lunch can improve quality.
"WOW, like no other place in the world...",September 2017,50,Venetian Pool,mendi,"This is an incredible place; from a coral rock quarry to a beautiful landmark.  This is a once in a life time experience where you have a swimming pool filled daily with spring water from an underground aquifer.  Go and take pictures like you will never again, ever find again...by the waterfall, in the tower, on the bridge...WOW.  Go and enjoy."
"This is not a tourist attraction, it's a public swimming pool",September 2017,20,Venetian Pool,curlyKar24,"What I pictured this to be after reading several different write ups about this and what this really is are two totally different things. While it is a beautiful pool, it is a public swimming pool.  It's a shame its not the natural swimming pool that you think it is. Instead you smell chlorine immediately and see a snack bar. A big disappointment."
Run club,July 2017,10,Deering Estate,karlar451,The place indeed it is beautiful. Unfortunately it was FULL of mosquitoes!! Even though I sprayed I was attacked so bad I had to call the event organizer to have someone pick me up. I have at least 100 bites! It was horrible. I asked if they spray for mosquitoes and I was told NO. I would like to know the reason for a place this beautiful were so many people visit it's not sprayed for mosquitoes. I am currently taking Benadryl every 6 hours and applying cortizone. It was horrible. 
Beautiful ,July 2017,40,Deering Estate,joaquim3141592,"Would recommend for all types of families and all ages. Although mosquitoes really bother, it's a great place to experience natural Miami"
Wonderful Property,July 2017,50,Deering Estate,scoutdreams,Parking wasn't a big deal as we parked virtually across from the entrance and it was on a Sunday.afternoon.
Nice place to visit,July 2017,50,Deering Estate,TLVento,We are member here and simply love to visit. Great place to take a walk and watch the manatees frolic. The two houses are lovely. Many events throughout the year.
Place to relax,August 2017,50,Deering Estate,datan,"Deering Estate is great place to visit and learn about area history. Take the tour of Stone House, Richmond Cottage and my favorite Natural Area Tour. There are tables to use, bring your picnic basket and enjoy the great view of the Biscayne bay."
Great fun place!,May 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,CAC53,"First we enjoyed going through the tunnels and feeding the monkeys in the little dishes on chains.  The monkeys would lower the dishes for you and you would drop (cheap) treats in them and they would pull them up, eat the food and drop it again.  The shows were very informative and fun.  We chose the VIP experience and got to go into the jungle and feed the monkey squirrels and one other type.  The monkey squirrels would climb on your arms and take the food out of your hands.  So much fun.  It was $90 (which included admission) and well worth it!  The assistants from the jungle were very helpful!!!"
great place but people should know they have lots of mosquitos!,June 2017,40,Monkey Jungle,Jeff c,place was great if your into animals and birds but remember to wear your OFF was eaten alive by mosquitos and ran up front with my wife to get cutter for body animals well kept and beautiful
EPIC!  If you love monkeys you have to come here!,July 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,djaz44,I love this place and if you like monkeys you have to check it out!!
Worth the visit!,April 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,Ellen S,"This place was just great, we loved it!  We went in early April, no bugs at all.  We were thrilled with the monkey experience, the monkeys are well fed and seem quite happy.  I felt a little sad for the gorilla, he had a tough life prior to arriving at Monkey Jungle, but he has a very nice and large area to roam, and he gets to watch TV whenever he wants!  I recommend this place to any monkey lovers, its great!  I would plan 2 to 3 hours there, it's a small privately owed park in the outskirks of the city."
Best thing we've ever done!,July 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,jobo1986,We are big animal lovers and so we telephoned and booked for the same day on to the rainforest tour which $89.95 per adult. We absolutely loved it! I have never had the opportunity to be so close to monkeys. We had squirrel monkeys jumping on us the whole time - kids would love it. The rest of the the Jungle showed other types of monkeys and birds - all really well looked after. Every animal sanctuary/zoo should have the same set up as Monkey Jungle. The staff are doing a fantastic job - keep up the good work! 
Absolutely the best location for a Convention Center.,January 2015,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,OscariniT,"If you are planing to attend an expo or event at Miami Beach Convention Center you are lucky. The center is 2-5 min walking for Lincoln Rd, where you have shops, restaurants and etc. You are also walking distance form many hotels. Itself Miami Beach Convention Center managed really well, and they try to get best venues to Miami Beach."
Art Show,March 2015,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,girleatsworld360,I came here for an art show and really enjoyed the layout and feel that was accomplished. There are many ongoing events for different interests. 
AARP National Convention 2015,March 2015,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,rands222,Pleasantly surprised to find a completely renovated structure with all the amenities.  Exhibit halls are gigantic.  There are Ballrooms and numerous meeting rooms of all sizes.  The foyers are large and excellent for registration and information.  There is well designed bus loading/unloading area by one entrance for out of town attendees staying at local hotels.  If time permits across the street from the MBCC is a must see Biological Park.  The only down side is there are no signs for parking lot entrance.
Great Venue & Attractions,March 2015,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,donl355,Great venue terrific staff and close to attractions and nightlife if MB. Enjoy!
Perfect venue!,May 2015,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,chigirl65,"I attended the AARP Life @50+ event from May 14 - May 16, 2015.  The Convention Center was large enough to handle the many diverse activities, from packing food for needy senior, to small intimate meals, to the huge conference and the awesome concerts."
We all wished we could take pictures like this on our iPhones,August 2015,50,Lik Miami,BrandonL85,Peter's photography was just amazing. I was surprised by the quality and depth of his work. It was a great decision to pop in and get out of the humidity while strolling Lincoln Road.
Stimulating visit,December 2014,50,Lik Miami,MiamiLuv2go,"Walking around Lincoln Road and wandering in to this Gallery.  It was like entering a feelgood outdoor spa.  Peter Lik's art jumps out at you, it speaks to your inner peace.  This sounds strange, but the world is so stressful, that to say I felt really different when I came in to the gallery.  Bottom line is I ended up buying 2 great 5 pack gift boxes for a great price.  Was able to give 8 clients one Peter Lik art piece and kept two for myself.  I plan to return soon and buy a larger piece for my home."
Magnificient,August 2015,50,Lik Miami,mariaf730,"Not matter how many times I go to Lincoln Road, I must walk in this gallery. Peter Lik's photography is breath taking, When I look into the pictures is like I am drawn to be right there at that moment,. Don't miss the opportunity to see and perhaps buy."
Worth A Visit for Sure,August 2015,30,Lik Miami,ross p,"Not sure how to review this...by the art or the Gallery itself.  Peter Lik's work is impressive and displayed well.   The gallery is neat and clean.  Ample help if you have a question.  it's just that the Gallery itself didn't keep my attention and make me want to stay.  Example..I was in Key West a few weeks ago with my family.  Pter Lik was also in a gallery down there.  The gallery's lighting, the display methods etc were so inviting that my family had to drag me out......On Lincoln Rd, I appreciated it but didn't feel a bond to keep me inside.   Still worth a look to see world class photography.  "
Fabulous Photography,August 2015,50,Lik Miami,Melanie_Lombardi,We always love visiting Peter's galleries.  His photography  is absolutely amazing and the staff at the gallery are excellent also.
Excellent museum esp to beat the heat,July 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,April B,"My 6 year old loved this museum and even my teen remarked on how cool it was for little kids.  So many different areas for them to explore and play dress up.  Lived the interactive ocean screen, the fishing, and fire truck the most"
Overpriced and underenjoyed,July 2017,10,Miami Children's Museum,Elmo_Cohen,"How much? I hadn't misheard. It was more than $100 for my family of four to enter this most disappointing of museums. Sure, the kids had some fun drawing animals and scanning them onto a big screen. And they enjoyed the remote-controlled boats. But the animatronic dinosaurs were amateurish and the overall experience falls well short of justifying the price. Instead of wasting time and money here, I'd go to the Rainforest Cafe at the Sawgrass Mills mall: they have better animatronics, friendly staff and they'll even throw in a delightful meal - all for less than the Miami Children's Museum."
Kids don't get tired of it!,July 2017,40,Miami Children's Museum,FabHart,"We've been there multiple times and kids always want to go again. Very hands-on and entertaining. Short, though..."
Place to go on a rainy vacation day!,August 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,guayames46,"On a day of thunder storms, this is the perfect vacation spot for families with children or grandchildren. Yes, you get a military discount! The children just love the multiple experiences they are exposed to and the adults enjoy their happiness."
Museum packed with interactive exhibits let down only by having no food options than a subway,August 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,AnnieAnnie81,The only let down was the lack of food options - only a subway onsite. We then left with tired and hungry children in urgent search of somewhere to get food in a city we didn't know! 
Culture for free,March 2016,50,The Bass,Sol L,I went to visit the museum 4 years ago and i like to do it at least once a year when friends wants to visit Miami. 
Look very interesting.,March 2017,30,The Bass,Tammie P,I wasn't able to go in due to my crew was ready to eat after walking all day. I plan to return and have been trying to visit online unsuccessful so far. 
Nice spot,July 2017,40,The Bass,LynnM112017,The museum itself is beautiful but like anything cultural in Miami there are rarely good exhibitions.
Great for Cruise ship travelers,August 2017,50,Bayfront Park,yuki215,"Bayfront Park is an ideal location for people going on a cruise. It has shops and restaurants, in order to occupy your time while waiting to cruise.  It is located across the street from the Holiday Inn."
Lunch,December 2017,40,Bayfront Park,Denise U,Fun and busy area.   Some good restaurants along the water with outside dining.  We ate at sharkeys and really enjoyed it.  
Very Relaxing,December 2017,40,Bayfront Park,waynen95,A great place to relax and watch the ships and boats. A huge Christmas tree in the park. Not overly crowded.
Very nice,December 2017,40,Bayfront Park,maite b,"I went there for Pitbull's concert. A nice place to walk, practice some sports and watch the ships. The sad part is that it's full of homeless people, make it look some dangerous. "
Fun in the sum,December 2017,40,Bayfront Park,UM-KC,Take a break from the usual tourist attractions and enjoy the sun near or under the palms.  Be sure to apply protection from the sun!
Explore the history of Miami!,August 2017,50,Calle Ocho,omirta,"Don't go on your own or you'll miss a lot of cool places and interesting history of this area. I highly recommend a tour. But if you want just to walk around and get some of the Latin flavors (both in the food and in the shops), you'll have a nice time. Make sure that you stop by Domino Park."
Culture Culture,May 2018,50,Calle Ocho,midiala l,"Calle Ocho is an exceptional place.  It is full of fun, characters, food, music, etc.  You can fine antique shops, Cuban Tabacco shops, note to mention restaurants. All types, cuban, Mexico, Colombian, etc.  There is an ice cream please call Azucar which is fantastic.  There are so many flavors that is hard to choose from.  You can find awsome entertainment in every corner.  YOu can find people sometimes dancing in the sidewalk from the cuban music coming from the restaurant.  There is a Goodwill in 8st between 12th and 9th Ave. that even though is used clothing and many good stuff it is worth the visit.  There are many brand name shoes and cloth for a very cheap price.  Worth the visit.  The dominos park is wonderful, there is nothing like little old people playing dominos.  It is a safe place to go at night.  You need to pay for parking.  Try to park in a lighted place just because there are some homeless sometimes walking around and they might be a little scary.  But nothing to worry about.  It is called litle havana because of all the Cuban that live there and the culture.  Enjoy a piece of Cuba in Miami"
Calle 8: The New Midtown?,May 2018,50,Calle Ocho,Miami2741,This could be the start of something big for this working class neighborhood West of Brickell that is already showing the first signs of gentrification.
Don't Blink,May 2018,30,Calle Ocho,cheertraveler,"Almost missed this point if interest.  Small strip of small specialty stores with a nice Art Deco style.  Was hoping to be able to experience more of ""Cuba"". Perhaps during festival time,  it in a daily basis a quick drive through is all you need"
Like being in Havana!!,April 2018,30,Calle Ocho,Adriana425,"It was an interesting few hours spent walking around Little Havana. Went into a bar, Cuba Ocho, for a mojito and beer-so cute. Ate at a Cuban restaurant. It was fun to browse the shops and visit Domino Park. Great to visit for something different."
we had a good time in this facility,December 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Jim R,We attended the 2018 Orange Bowl game. Parking was easy with excellent access for handicapped. The stadium itself is modern and seating areas are covered and offer good views. Concessions are varied and prices not too extreme (we pay more at Redskins games FEDEX field)
Orange bowl,December 2018,40,Hard Rock Stadium,Eddie M,"A Great stadium to watch a football game, the seats were chair type and good views. They had a lot of good restaurants inside stadium."
Nice & Relaxing!,December 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Mary B,"Easy access in and out of the Orange Bowl. Vendors and restrooms well located, great parking and plenty of folks available to help. The only ding was having to go pick up the parking pass at an out of the way location and it did not make it clear when ordering, had to call to find out. Otherwise, great experience!"
The Stadium,November 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,yourhelpfulfoodie,"The sound system, the seats, and the prices we got were great. I'm definitely going back and I hope I can take my kids to so they can enjoy because this time I only took my daughter."
Nice.. ,August 2016,40,Village of Merrick Park,monequita,"It is very popular for lunch time, you can see people being happy. Many working mates tables and friends tables. "
Great stroll ,August 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,annettea2013,"Village of Merrick has everything you need!The best stores like Neiman Marcus beautiful boutiques and much more. The best restaurants. Beautiful sitting areas. At Christmas its stunning. All year round a must see  if you come  to Miami. A,classy experience beautiful people. Can't miss with this place."
Great place for dinning,August 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Esther I,"Very pleasant with family, easy way to enjoy the day."
Something for Everyone,August 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,victoria51414,I love just walking around Merrick Park. The weekends always bring a lot of families and kids playing in the open areas. The shopping is wonderful as well. A good mix of high end and average priced stores. Also a good variety of men and women's stores. They are pet friendly in the grass areas so it is a good place to walk my dog. We frequently visit Yardhouse as well. Great location with a lot to do.
Great place to shop!!,September 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Bushrakhalid6,"It's the best place in coral gables to shop! You get everything you need from clothes to shoes to whatever you wish for. It also has Designer outlets, Neman Marcus, northstrom  and lulu lemon. When you are done shopping you can choose from different cuisines to eat from and for desert nothing beats Godiva ice cream. I also got my hair done from blo bar which turned out amazing. And if you live near by then why not join the gym or soul cycle classes there. It's a one stop destination for everything you need! "
Wonderful music,February 2014,50,New World Symphony,Ruth B,      
Near Lincoln.......,August 2013,40,New World Symphony,PalJoey88,"A huge forecourt, where you can sit and eat or drink after a long walk or swim. Its close to Lincoln St, so a volley of food outlets to experience."
Beautiful space,June 2014,40,New World Symphony,will_work_for_meat,The bar is covenant and the staff is attentive.
Great Talent - Amazing Facility,September 2014,50,New World Symphony,dalepenn,"There is not a bad seat, and the performances are wallcast in the adjacent SoundScape Park at no cost!  Enjoy."
Crowded. Clean?,September 2017,30,Venetian Pool,Hjdiazesq,"Very nice setting but usually too crowded for comfort in the summer, so much that it does not feel clean."
To go or not to go...is it worth it?,May 2017,50,Venetian Pool,Marime05,"After years, and years living in Miami, I finally went to the Venetian pool 10 years ago with my daughter's school. Few people from my area had ever been there. And we are all ""locals""!!!! Beautiful, refreshing (specially on hot Miami days). You can google it and all the info is there, and it's true. Very clean, transparent spring water. Children have a great time, and so do adults. It gets crowded and I understand that at a certain point they don't allow anyone in. So arrive early, and choose a patch of grass to lay your towel. Is like you travel in time, to the 50s...or something like it. You can buy food there or take your cooler. Very different! Very Miami, and it's not the beach!"
"Beautiful, relaxing pool",November 2017,40,Venetian Pool,LeaKone,"We enjoyed our visit to the Venetian Pool.  The pool itself is very cool - especially the waterfalls and caves.  It would be a fun activity for a family.  It can be a bit pricey, and chairs are extra.  They have a shaded picnic area, so to make the price worthwhile, come for the whole day."
Classic part of Coral Gables,February 2018,40,Venetian Pool,dldmia,"My parents went there as children, and enjoyed as cool swim on a hot Summer day.  It was closed recently for renovations and cooler temperatures.  Uniquely, the water is replaced daily, avoiding chlorination. "
Equinox Sunrise Photograph,September 2017,50,Deering Estate,b0bingram,"The equinox sunrise is a fantastic opportunity to photograph the sunrise from the boat dock. At the equinox, the sun rises directly in the middle of the boat harbor with the majestic palm trees equidistant on either sides. Jessica, the tour guide, provides relevant commentary and banter with the visitors making for a very pleasant morning."
BEAUTIFUL!!!,October 2017,50,Deering Estate,kmauzon,Totally awesome! Despite the recent damage by Hurricane Irma the Deering Estates clean up and recovery was fast. The Estate was beautiful. The ocean view is a must to see. So much history to see and learn. 
STUNNING View!,October 2017,40,Deering Estate,59sunseeker,"The best part of Deering Estate, in our opinion is the view...positively STUNNING.  Ours was somewhat blocked due to a wedding that was being held during hours - it had to be rescheduled due to a tropical storm the previous day.  I wish we could have had the full impact of the view from the estate. There was also a lot of standing water.  The house was beautiful, and the tour informative.  The tour only included the bottom on the home, although we were free to roam the second story."
this is way out of town,October 2017,30,Deering Estate,LDWG,"An old house in nice setting on the water; was here for a wedding.  outdoor wedding reception in early October is a certifiably bad idea -- heat and bugs led to early exodus.  Some interesting architectural elements, but not worth the trip from downtown."
Awesome place to see and learn about the estate and his philanthropists owner,November 2017,50,Deering Estate,tomasm669,Absolutely recomendable for families and private events. I would go again this month to have the tour visit. 
where monkey business is a pleasure,August 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,523billyt,"Off the beaten path, this is a great adventure. Just the setting alone...a mini rain-forest sanctuary away from the bustle of Miami, is worth the visit. A little pricey, but a unique experience for kids and adults alike. For a rare treat, splurge for the $89 rain forest adventure, where you are part of the environment instead of looking through a cage at it, and miniature spider monkeys feed right from your hands. Our guide there was patient, friendly, and informative. Some of the jungle's residents are displaced former pets and circus rescues. It's good to know such a nice place is now home for them."
feeding the monkeys,August 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,dia129,The squirrel monkeys were very adorable and they were fun to feed.  They jump on your hands and take the food that they like.  
Monkey jungle,September 2017,20,Monkey Jungle,Dafna B,They should be able to roam free  with the monkeys .
What a wonderful home for the monkey's,November 2016,50,Monkey Jungle,dpaigej,"Overall, we had a wonderful time and are so thankful for the jungle to save the animals."
Great time!!!,November 2017,50,Monkey Jungle,Newyorkbros,Had such a great time here with family and friends.  Price was very reasonable and got to interact with the monkeys!!!  will defiantly be coming back.
Miami Beach Convention Center Needs to Come down!,April 2015,10,Miami Beach Convention Center,Villani,"Worked many a show there. Place looks terrible. Parking is expensive. The choice of food available for product shows is terrible. They need to take it down and put up a state of the art center so Miami can attract the big shows, like the Consumer Electronics Show and the Houseware Show. Vegas and Chicago, mostly Vegas gets the big one. Miami is sophisticated enough now to attract world visitors and is the gateway to South Americal"
Business Meeting,March 2015,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,Guillaume Willi... R,Experienced Miami Beach Convention Center during Art Basel last year and it was an overall good experience. Staff members are very kind and helpfull. Always ready for a convention time!
Good Site for Convention,August 2015,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,BocaGators,"The food service is terrible. For example, $9 for a ""pizza"" from Papa John's that is essentially a slice. Also, there are no tables or even chairs near the food service near the entry doors and the staff are clueless as to where there are chairs and tables [there are actually]. Many people were sitting on the floor to eat because they couldn't find the tables. Management is at fault for not training their staff.  Take a walk - there are many local casual restaurants nearby including Lincoln Road."
Will need more than a day to cover Basel,December 2014,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,Chic_Geek_Uno,Was here for Art Basel. Get a map. This place is huge and confusing but had everything a convention center should have to offer. 
Plan on being early,January 2015,10,Miami Beach Convention Center,Mnkevin4723,"The convention center is nice but like most of Miami and Miami Beach, parking is impossible and expensive when you find it, and if you screw up and don't understand the complicated parking restrictions they tow your car.  Hotels and resturants are expensive in the area. I would rather go to Ft Lauderdale or Orlando convention centers where the patrons are remembered in the convention center use."
"Great work, no service",September 2015,30,Lik Miami,lgrn22Ny,"Love the photos, we have 3 right now. No one greeted us when we came in or acknowledged our presence. "
A global trip in 10 min,September 2015,50,Lik Miami,symbiose,If you ever forget how beautiful the planet where we live is ... just stop for 10 minutes at the gallery and you will be reminded. Of course you will also be frustrated not to be able to walk with one picture under your arm to put in our imaginary mansion...but it is worth it.
Great images but buyer beware,October 2015,30,Lik Miami,beekeeper16328,Liked the images but a little concerned about the price structure having read the NY Times article. Worth a look and listen to the staff as they go through their pitch.
Go see for yourself...amazing!,November 2015,50,Lik Miami,Alexa8776, We always visit a Peter Lik Gallery when given the chance.  His work is clearly genius and a must is you love travel and photography.  Staff greeted us kindly even though we were just looking.  Thanks for that!
Gorgeous!,November 2015,50,Lik Miami,williamsonhk,"So. Much. Talent. Seriously, these photographs were gorgeous. Our friends took us in here before dinner and it was lovely. Everything was stunning- the photographs, presentation... I would love to own some of these pieces."
Funny and nice place to learn,November 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,RodrigoRonda,We were a big group of children visiting the museum. Such a nice place for children. My son really enjoyed the music area.
Not deserved,November 2017,30,Miami Children's Museum,experto11,Miami does not deserve a second class museum for kids.  Everything in the place seems like second hand or not interesting. I will not recommend to go there with your children. 
Awesome Kids Museum,November 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,Jenn J,So much to do at Miami Children's Museum. Lots of hands on things. My kids love the Publix displays as well as the cruise ship section! Subway to have lunch inside 
Ver ya good for smaller children,April 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,Shanom V,This is very nice place to take younger children. They have a variety of attractions and I found it quite educational.
Eclectic art museum,December 2017,40,The Bass,Mktpro99,Interesting small museum was very modern works of art. Terrific place for a cocktail party and reception. It was hard to hear the docent due to the noise. Worth a short visit.
Looking Better than Ever after the Expansion,December 2017,40,The Bass,Deluxpinion,"The Bass Museum has a good core of traditional art. Now it's expanded galleries are showing a HOT contemporary artist: Hugo Rondinone and there are also two other contemporary shows, so you have a switch here, whereby the museum is effectively entering an important phase of developing exhibitions in the Contemporary art field, check out their website for the latest. Last Year I saw an exhibition on Peter Marino that was awesome as well. A must see if you are in Miami!"
Not my thing,December 2017,10,The Bass,753rupertg,If you already think you want to go there - then is probably a good place to visit. If you are unsure if you want to spend 1-2 hours looking at “art” then you are probably looking for some reassurance but you won’t get it here. I would rather have spent the time on the beach. 
Mika's movies are the real blockbusters!,December 2017,40,The Bass,Lapster2011,Hint: Check out Mika’s interviews on Youtube. Helped a lot in decoding her videos.
Bayfront ,February 2018,30,Bayfront Park,LollysLook,We walked around this pretty park and stayed for the sunset. The area is green and relaxing but homeless people are sprawled on the grass or laying on benches with their belongings. 
What’s New!,February 2018,40,Bayfront Park,michaelmG455SN,"Every time I visit Miami for the boat show, I find myself transmitting through the park for food or transportation.  And every time, there’s a great activity to enjoy.  Dog show, musicians, artists, or just interesting people... it’s a great Miami treasure!"
Nice place to relax and look what is going on around on the beach,April 2017,50,Bayfront Park,Gerdtraveller,"Bayfront Park is a nice and calm area with palms around were you can relax and have a look on the beach. It is only a short distance from the area were you can chill around look on people and shops, enjoy drinks and meals. Whatever you want. And then The Bayfront Park with the nice beach area!!!!"
Get out and exercise,March 2018,40,Bayfront Park,Ahems,It is a great place to get out and go for a walk. There are plenty of things to see and people to watch. It is a wonderful place to work off some calories and feel good about your self.
Great park.,March 2018,50,Bayfront Park,gvlhrm,"Avoid going when Ultra Music Festival is schedule, because it takes place at the park itself."
Very goot!,July 2018,50,Calle Ocho,Evan L,Very nice good location near all the things that are fun and things. Nice looking. Warm water. Muy bien!
Very Cuban,May 2018,50,Calle Ocho,HarleyMatt,"A lovely area of town that is great in the daytime, it might be different at night ... you can walk from Bayside but it takes about half an hour.. the area is very Cuban so you do not feel you are in America. even the McDonalds menu is in Spanish. Cool place"
Short trip but worth it. Could have spent more time here exploring.,July 2018,40,Calle Ocho,A5685GBCARLS,Smile and talk with the locals in Little Havana on Calle Ocho. You might be surprised what you find out.
Fun street with lots to see and do,August 2018,50,Calle Ocho,AberdeenshireTom,"Fun place to visit, lots of local eateries, shops and cigar rolling - a great flavour of Cuba. Local music, dancing and a fun vibe in the evening."
Amazing experience,December 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Swe70,"First of all the atmosphere was super! Great people, good beer, friendliness all the way through. There was not a boring minute of the NFL game. I should also mention that the parking (although rather expensive) was super with very easy exit in and out."
Hard Rock,December 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Mark H,Great food!  Great sight lines.  Great video boards.  
Always a great experience,July 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Felix V,"I get back for a soccer game, This venue always have a good service and organized entrance and good stores"
Great stadium,November 2018,40,Hard Rock Stadium,michaelibrahim11,Its a nice stadium that hosts lots of games and events. But its far away from the city. You will need a car or uber but it will be expensive one. Its at around 30 minutes on the highway.
One of the nicest stadiums I've ever seen,October 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,rvmiami,Great upgrades have made this stadium world class. It is definitely the way to go to watch a game or see a concert. Go Dolphins!
Relaxing and great,September 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Carrie S,Scenic and relaxing. All luxury stores are located here. Love to walk around this mall. Great restaurants as well. Godiva is here and I love to go get their soft serve. 
Great shopping,October 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Nazikanton,Beautiful mall. On Sundays they have the farmers market going on. Great shopping for what ever you are looking for. Love the Nordstrom there. Great places to eat also. 
Beautiful little outdoor mall,October 2016,40,Village of Merrick Park,KateColo,"Took a lovely walk through a pretty neighborhood during our stay at the Biltmore and found this shopping mall. This is only about a mile and a half away. Lots of nice shops, great layout, and fun restaurants. Spent lots and of time in the cute Lilly store and Vineyard Vines! "
Enjoying life...Miami style !,August 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,acasasnovasg,and enjoy life...Miami style !
Nice shops and restaurants. ,November 2016,40,Village of Merrick Park,cristyLIC,"It's a convenient upscale mall in Coral Gables, close to the airport and the US1. I specially enjoyed certain stores like Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Anthropologie and Peek. Most restaurants are good. Mariposa in Neiman Marcus is wonderful. If you are in the area...this mall it's a must."
Excellent concert,October 2014,50,New World Symphony,urgoing,"Watch an outdoor concert. It was amazing everyone was on the lawn in their beach chairs in the evening, it was awesome "
"Free concerts in the park, top music & community spirit",October 2014,50,New World Symphony,HotelGuestSept2011,"The free outdoor concerts are live-streamed onto the wall of the Symphony Hall. The New World Symphony members are fantastic, the program was musically inventive and interspersed with video clips of the talented players, and conducted by MTT (Michael Tilson Thomas). Don't miss it!"
Amazing and so organised!,November 2013,40,New World Symphony,chante42,The crew at new symphony really tried! Great outdoor musical concert for the evening. One of the must sees!
This is a Beach alternative to take your family for an extended picnic and pool activities....,March 2018,40,Venetian Pool,hutti777,"Great larger pool set up as a smaller hand made lake in natural surroundings. Worth a visit, but it is costly if besides its entrance fee you plan on having food and drinks there. The activity is limited to sitting or having a swim at a larger pool. It seems you can bring in your own food and drinks, so this is maybe something to consider when visiting in particular if you visit with family members not to overburden your wallet."
Fun with the family ,April 2018,50,Venetian Pool,barbarao304,This place is awesome! One bad thing you can’t take small children due to something with the water. Which is understandable! But it’s an experience 
Spectacular trip in time! ,May 2018,50,Venetian Pool,Eduardo G,The Venetian Pool is a wonderful place to transport yourself in time to one of the spectacular attractions in the city Beautiful of Coral Gables. The water is on the cold side. But your body adjusts quickly to the  water temperature. It’s a place to enjoy with family and friends. Don’t forget to visit the cave at the pool and take plenty of pictures to show your family and friends. Pictures will bring back memories of your visit to this special place that I am sure you will want to return. 
Unreasonably Pricey,April 2018,40,Venetian Pool,Karaoshkin,"I expected a more historical setting for this pool at this price. It is basically like hotel theme pools in Las Vegas or Caribbean All inclusive resort. I don't see a reason why this exist in the first place. In Miami everyone has an access to a pool or the beach. So I wonder who comes here.... tourists. I understand the need to maintain and salary for lifeguards, that's where the price comes from. But this should not be on tourists wish list. Yet, there is a lot of people here. Good marketing."
AMAZING,May 2018,50,Venetian Pool,Chriszbright,"I highly recommend this beautiful pool. I know there are environmental concerns about the pool because it is drained and filled completely every night. I’m not sure if those concerns are warranted or not. What I can say, is that this pool is an experience not to be missed! Beautiful in every way. The caves are the best part hands down!"
Super interesting,January 2018,50,Deering Estate,J0hn_617,"Lots of history beginning thousands of years ago.  Interesting houses, great view.  Highlight was Elliot's tour of the property.  Since there were only 2 of us on the tour he offered a golf cart ride that could cover more territory.  He gave a great tour of the history, geology, hydrology (water is everything), and flora."
Beautiful Area,January 2018,40,Deering Estate,lovinretirement2015,Beautiful grounds and interesting house. There are two different tours included in entrance fee. Be sure to ask about both. No food available to purchase so either bring food or eat before arriving if planning to go on both tours. House is sparsely furnished.
not much to see,February 2018,30,Deering Estate,ellenbee56,"We visited this site after touring the nearby Fairchild Tropical Garden. We were underwhelmed and were expecting more, since it was so highly rated at both TripAdvisor and in the AAA Tour Book. We missed the property tour, which might have helped us enjoy it more, but to us there wasn't much to see here. The beautiful stone house was only sparsely furnished, and the adjacent cottage can be toured in 15 minutes (we did not wait for the house tour). We did not walk the grounds too far but did enjoy the rocking chairs on the cottage porch. The view to the bay and pier was inviting but was quite far to walk, so we skipped that; our view of the expansive lawn area was marred by large trash cans set up every 50 feet or so (in advance of an upcoming concert, I believe). Overall, we were not terribly impressed with this site and finished our visit in about an hour."
ghost tour,November 2017,50,Deering Estate,Teresa N,i went here for the ghost tour at night. it was scary and atmospheric. the estate is nice too for a day tour.
Great concerts in a lovely setting!,August 2017,40,Deering Estate,omirta,Check out the Deering Estate schedule of activities. Concerts both inside or outside in the gardens are lovely and specially romantic. But not cheap.
"If You Love Monkeys, You Have To Go Here",June 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,stephencA7660NM,"We visited this zoo for monkeys over 20 years ago and the place is still the same. It's a little pricey but well worth it if you love primates. There's a large selection of apes and birds on display. Many of the monkeys run free while you walk through a fenced in path through the property. The monkeys come out and you can feed them. Be warned that if you go in the summer, it is HOT as you are outside the entire time. There are a few scheduled ""shows"" throughout the day were various staff members do informative presentations. Definitely recommend."
The best monkey place ever!,June 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,Shonda W,I wasn't sure what to expect when we visited other than seeing monkeys. We bought monkey food as we paid for the visit and as we went thru the walkways little bowls on chains kept being dropped down the walkway area by all the little monkeys! They wanted their treats! We would put some sunflower seeds or raisins in the bowl and the monkeys would pull the bowl up by the chain. Was so much fun seeing them get the food out then drop the bowl for more treats! I highly recommend visiting this place. I could've stayed there all day watching them. Superb visit!!
A hidden gem!,June 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,jenjaxmom,"Don’t be afraid to ask the staff questions. They are incredibly patient and will answer anything. They will not be a party to letting you steal an adorable spider monkey and putting it in your oversized purse brought specifically for that reason, but other than that, they ROCK. "
Cute hidden spot,July 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,13_andyv,"Spend a few hours here, watch the shows, see the monkeys living their lives as close to their wild selves as possible, pulling up their bowls with the treats you give them. They also have a silverback, an elderly gentleman with his own habits and his own dvd player (you can't see that though). Also a few reptiles and birds inhabit the area. Charming little place."
I love this placr,July 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,Lcbell12,Highly recommend . This is my second visit. The place is awesome. You get to walk through several caged in trails and be visited by hundreds of monkeys along with special areas with gibbons and the sort. The coolest part is being able to feed them. I had a better time doing this than my grandchildren. Fantastic must see place if you are in south Florida. 3 thumbs up. 
Nice Facility,September 2015,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,Panda1230,"The facility is well maintained, plenty of parking and a good size for smaller national shows."
Nice,September 2015,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,Missytikal,I've been to plenty conventions here and I find it clean well organized and easily accessible. Parking is also right across the street 
The most worst place.,October 2015,20,Miami Beach Convention Center,Lioudmila D,"Very old place ,smiling bad. Nothing interesting to see. The most worst center what I see in my life."
old and ugly,May 2015,20,Miami Beach Convention Center,lavillazon,"the building and facilities are very old, ugly, this place should be demolished complete, the once propoused Rem Koolhaas's design was way nice for this place, so in general , mediocre place and facility, it is a shame since the location.   "
Nice Trade Show Venue,October 2015,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,Beep757,"I have attended the JIS Jewelry show each of the past 5 years.  This is a very nice, clean venue for a show.  Close location to hotels , restaurants and beach.  "
Another great gallery,January 2016,50,Lik Miami,Akma4,"While on Lincoln Rd amongst all the shops is a quiet calling to stop in to this gallery and admire the talented photography of this artist. Breathtaking landscapes, seascapes with artistic flair. Very impressive."
WOW,January 2016,50,Lik Miami,gottchagirl,You could stare at these photos and walk in this gallery for hours and there are little viewing rooms. The sales people are so knowlegable and seem to truly love their jobs.
Great Art,December 2015,50,Lik Miami,225thomasv,Peter Lik's gallery is amazing. Anyone that visits South Beach should make the time to stroll down Lincoln Rd to see his works. You will be in awe. So many to view and no matter when you go back you will always find something new to be amazed by.
I would pay to see art like this,January 2016,40,Lik Miami,18kimmr,"Like a mini art museum except it is all amazing photos by Peter Lik and you can buy them if you win the lottery. We have stopped in here each time we are in town. You could spend 5 minutes in here or 30minutes , depending on how long you stare at his photos. Not a huge space at all but very well laid out."
Great way to keep kids entertained for hours while learning.,January 2018,50,Miami Children's Museum,306DonnaB,Great way to keep the kiddos entertained. They will spend hours playing and learning. Many different areas. Really liked it.
Not a museum and far too expensive,February 2018,10,Miami Children's Museum,Rob_H_Travelmouse,Cleanest Subway restaurant we've seen so far. After 11 am classes of local schools arrive.
Fun museum,November 2017,50,Miami Children's Museum,anaz08,The museum can be pricy with a large family. Since I am a teacher I get in for free but have to pay for my kids. They love going and I love that they change themes often. We have gone when it was Thomas the train and the dinosaurs. I suggest you bring you own food or go out to eat since they only have subs for lunch. 
Nice intereactive center,March 2018,40,Miami Children's Museum,docacadien,Nice inter active center. Avoid week ends of special holidays because of crowds. You can easily spend 3 hours or more.
Good place ,March 2018,40,Miami Children's Museum,JokkeNu,The place is great and a lot of different things to do. Worth a visit. Minuses : felt like several things closed or not working. Also not the biggest place so gets pretty cramped even on a Monday which should not the be busiest day. 
Quirky modern art,January 2018,50,The Bass,Howard A,Pascale Marthine Tayou's eggs were wonderfully juxtaposed with traditional images. And Ugo Rondinone's room full of clowns was fabulous (though apparently some people are unnerved by clowns). It is well worth a visit but can be difficult to find as it is not well signposted.
"Contemporary art in a historic building, recently revivified.",January 2018,40,The Bass,leisurist,"The exhibits in the Bass, mostly temporary, are exciting and stimulating.  It is easy to find, and worth a visit."
Truly enjoyed this fascinating gem,January 2018,50,The Bass,MyZelda,"What a giant of a cozy museum! I enjoyed every nook and cranny of The Bass. I would call it funky, fun, and meaningful. Make sure Trisha is there and ask her to explain the exhibit where she is - not a docent - but a security guard with volumes of knowledge. I wish I lived in the area so I could return when the exhibits change. (Don’t miss the video installations, they are truly funky.)"
A small museum focused on contemporary art.,January 2018,30,The Bass,KSfamily00,"Since reopening, the Bass has focused on contemporary art, sometimes placed in contrast to the old masters of the original collection. The museum is small, but If you enjoy the avant-garde, it is worth a visit."
A lovely park to spend an afternoon in,May 2018,50,Bayfront Park,eily31,"Bayfront Park is a lovely place to spend a few hours. It's peaceful, has a great sculpture park and plenty of seats to take a break from the heat."
Fun Youthful place,October 2017,40,Bayfront Park,expeditionkitty,Amazing views and entertainment. Love the location. It is near great restaurants and shops. Super youthful and energetic!
What a view!,June 2018,50,Bayfront Park,cheech0515,This was close to our hotel and we walked allover it.  The views of the harbor are incredible!  Relaxing
Shop and hacve fun by the water,October 2017,40,Bayfront Park,Romulo G,Our favourite fun is to take a boat and take a tour  of beautiful )and celebs= homes around Miami.
Relaxing or happening - however you want it,May 2018,50,Bayfront Park,866anirbanb,"It's a nice place to hang out with friends for drinks and relax. Also, fun and relaxing to spend time with family. A short walk to the Bay front plaza to do shopping or enjoy live music or just have a couple of drinks."
Cool park in front of the symphony building,December 2016,40,Soundscape Park,LesL989,There are many trees for shade and walking paths and some really interesting structures holding bouganvilla for shade.
One of the best things about Miami Beach!,December 2016,50,Soundscape Park,miamiflor,"Gorgeously landscaped public park adjoining New World Symphony. They have Wallcasts of the symphony concerts all season long. Bring a blanket, a picnic and get there early for best seats. They also have free movies on Wednesday nights and various other collaborations throughout the year. Look online and search ""Soundscape Park"" for updated details. If something is going on while you're in town, don't miss it. "
"Small park, bougainvillea",January 2017,30,Soundscape Park,Lillavilda,Just a small park but with beatiful flowers bougainvillea. Quite quiet though. Outdoor movies every wednesday at 8pm. It's free.
The former home of the Miami Beach acro yoga,February 2016,50,Soundscape Park,buddhakouri, Why is it called soundscape park? It is because of it being right beside New World Symphony Center. Here you can hear the music coming from the concert. It is once where the old Miami Beach acro yoga jam used to be located  for more than two years.  
a piece of Cuba on SW 8 Street,August 2018,30,Calle Ocho,rrivera57,"this was a sleepy little street back in the day, but is now bustling with tourists on a daily basis...great little restaurants, great music which can be heard everywhere, cigar makers here and there...."
A taste of Cuba in the US,December 2018,40,Calle Ocho,hydrorock,"Stopped down here again recently to check out the cigar shops, domino park and do some shopping/sight seeing. Calle Ocho is a very long street. We were in the area of Little Havana between SW14th Ave and SW 17th Ave. Live music on the street and some good food/bars. A little crowded (Saturday)."
Gret food and shiooing,December 2018,50,Calle Ocho,travelnut,"Interesting area with gret food, and lots of shopping. We took a local food tour and had a great time with our guide. He was very thourogh "
Don't miss this taste of Cuba,July 2018,50,Calle Ocho,jennifera399,"As we didn't have much time to explore since Orlando was a 4 hour drive back from Miami, but it was definitely a worthwhile walk after eating that delicious ice cream from Azucar.  You can totally smell the fresh Cuban cigars and love the music and dancers in the streets,  Makes you feel as if you are right in Cuba."
More than a street,December 2018,40,Calle Ocho,Lyn_Farmer,"Calle Ocho is, literally, Eighth Street, the nexus of Cuban culture in Miami. There are many Cuban and Latin neighborhoods in the city, but Eighth Street, extending from near downtown Miami 40 blocks west to LeJeune Road, is famous for its seemingly endless stretch of Cuban restaurants, bars, nightclubs, cigar shops and more. There are varied cuisines along the street these days, but some of the city's most famous (though not necessarily the best) Cuban restaurants are here, notably the heavily mirrored and highly over-rated Versailles. One of the city's best bars, Ball & Chain, is here, and the terrific Northern Thai hole-in-the-wall restaurants Lung Yai Thai Tapas as well. It's a varied neighborhood these days, and great fun to drive. Keep in mind that from Coral Gables to downtown, it is one way running West to East."
Miami Open Tennis,March 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,Ivy B,The overall experience was good. Parking was $25 in advance. We got there early so there we got as close as possible to the entrance. The security check point moved pretty quickly. Each person could bring in up to 1 liter of water. I saw people with all kinds of non-alcoholic drinks in their bags. They even let people bring in food which I thought was not prohibited. It actually is a good thing since the food options could use some improvement. Not very many healthy food options. The food and beverages were very expensive. The temporary seating looked to be much more spacious and comfortable than the permanent stadium seats. The only good thing about the permanent 300 level seat is they are protected from the elements. The Grandstand and side course are the way to go during the first weekend and watch the stadium matches on the big screen. You definitely want to be in the 100 or 200 sections.
It is an amazing stadium,July 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Ariel C,The best seats are in the middle of the field so you can see everywhere of the field and the best time to go is summer but the clothing wear is more expensive online than in the stadium so I would recommend to get the items in the stadium rather than get them online
Miami Open,March 2019,30,Hard Rock Stadium,Popiel62,"If not the field packed with the wold top players I would totally regret coming there. In compare to other top tennis tournaments in the U.S. like Indian Wells, US Open or Cincinnati, Miami Open is far behind."
Miami Tennis Open ,March 2019,10,Hard Rock Stadium,L7812KHrobinm,"Went here last weekend for the Miami Open, and I’ve never experienced such awful customer service! The two older women in blue dresses giving wrist bands for the club seats, were absolutely awful. I lost my phone in the restroom, and instead of being helpful they were rude and gave us zero customer service. I will never return to this venue, no matter what event it is!"
Great Tennis Venue,March 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Jane S,Can’t wait to come back and watch more tennis.

Beautiful upscale shopping center,January 2017,50,Village of Merrick Park,Mom23Cs,"I get the feeling this has kind of overtaken Coral Gables Miracle Miles for shopping at least, not sure about restaurants. Beautiful shopping center with plentiful parking, large courtyards, and fountains. Very pleasant center to shop, go window shopping, relax with a cup of tea or grab a bite to eat."
Very Nice Outdoor Mall - Great Shops - Great Opportunity to Enjoy The Outdoors,January 2017,50,Village of Merrick Park,Michelle112013,"This mall is very clean and beautiful.  The grounds have beautiful landscaping, plenty of seating areas, and are very well kept. Nice stores, mid-range to upscale.  Several restaurants, and a movie theater.  A great place to spend a few hours."
Easy strolls.,December 2016,50,Village of Merrick Park,Mariana R,"Plenty of reasonable interior parking space. Easy strolls and window shopping. Large and varied beautifully-kept grounds, Spectacular Christmas season."
A shopping experience,February 2017,50,Village of Merrick Park,rosavega2014,This is a very nice place with a lot of stores as well as restaurants. Parking is relatively easy except for weekends. There are many clothing stores as well as stores for household goods. Very relaxed atmosphere
This is amazing!,December 2014,50,New World Symphony,Ade5,"Sit under the stars, with swaying palm trees and a light tropical breeze while listening to a first class orchestra playing wonderful classical music and all this is free.  New World Symphony, a training fellowship for extremely talented musicians, has created a park outside the symphony hall with fantastic acoustics and up close visuals of the musicians and orchestra.  Bring a picnic, wine and friends, but get there well before performance time to insure you get a space on the lawn.  If you enjoy classical music under the stars, you can't miss this!"
Outdoor concerts,December 2014,50,New World Symphony,2014Suzanne2014,Love to sit in the park with a snack or wine and watch the wall at of the New World Symphony with the hundreds of other music lovers
Outdoor free entertainment.,January 2015,50,New World Symphony,Debi Q,Weekly movies in their front yard park free.  symphony on wall in park also sometimes.  They call it Wallcast at the New World Symphony.
NIce getaway in Miami,July 2018,40,Venetian Pool,ElizaSL,A little warning - there are caves to swim into where the water is not as deep as in the rest of the pool. The roof in the caves is very sharp which my son got to experience. He got a bad cut in the head wonted crumbling our visit significantly. Big plus to the nice lifeguards who took care of him in a very good way.
Desperate - not worth it,August 2018,10,Venetian Pool,conm732,"That all said, the staff were all friendly."
Beautiful piece of history!,August 2018,50,Venetian Pool,JL2015T,"We have lived in Florida for almost 30 years and this has been on my bucket list. Finally got to go and it was beautiful. We got there at about 2:30, knowing that they only let a certain number of people in every day. It was crowded but we were able to find our own little niche in the pool to hang out in and have some space. Beautiful water! Very refreshing and clean. At about 3:30, they announced they had reached capacity for the day and would not be letting anyone else in. This was nice because, as people were leaving, it became less crowded. $20 per person is a little pricey but it was a really nice way to cool down and experience a spring-fed pool. "
It's not so fun that is look,August 2018,20,Venetian Pool,ninajovic25,"It is old; there is not enough space even when the pool is not full of the people to put towel somewhere, except in the dirty sand which is an imitation of the beach and where is not shade. Deck chairs are old and charged separately in particular if you are lucky to find them, there is no shade sufficient. Is smaller than it looks in the photos. Not going to this place you will not miss anything. Wast of time."
Relaxing by the Pool,August 2018,50,Venetian Pool,pah11,"Lovely day spent relaxing by the Venetian Pool. Got here early to get a choice lounge chair location in the shade. Very touristy for a city pool, but not too crowded because school is in session. "
Estate home museum ,June 2018,40,Deering Estate,A7996PQelizabethm,Bring a paper towel roll and baby wipes for clean ups. For messy finger foods but well worth it. 
An afternoon to remember at the Deering Estate,June 2018,50,Deering Estate,Alfredo B,I very highly recommend a visit ti this espectacular property
Back in Time,April 2018,50,Deering Estate,midiala l,Enjoy your history.
Beautiful history,April 2018,50,Deering Estate,TravelingMomof4our,Visiting Deering Estates is a great way to learn about history and enjoy a beautiful view. The property is located on the water. The water view is spectacular. It’s a great place for picnics and photos.
Paradise on Earth would look like this,July 2018,50,Deering Estate,NewYorkerluvsKeyWest,"Thanks to these two wealthy and far-sighted brothers, a part of historical, natural Florida that is all but lost throughout the state, has been preserved into the 21st century so that we might see how the other half lived when Florida was wilderness."
Monkey Jungle - Rainforest Adventure Tour,September 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,GjohnnieG,The Rainforest Adventure Tour at Monkey Jungle this past weekend with visiting relatives was the highlight of their visit! Well worth the extra cash to tour the rainforest and hand-feed the squirrel monkeys!  They are so adorable!  This experience was literally ALL we talked about the entire 5-day visit!  Our tour guide Bay Lee (sorry if mis-spelled!) was AWESOME!
What a great adventure,October 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,JIMBOBOB32,"We have been to Monkey Jungle several times and each time is an adventure.   We have always done the Rainforest adventure tour but this one was the best.   Ed, who was our guide was great.  the squirrel monkeys were everywhere when it came time to feed them.  Male, females with babies attached.   It was outstanding. If you think the cost is high for the rainforest tour. When you are done you will say ""money well spent""   There are not a lot of places that are around where you get a one on one adventure with the animals but this one is exceptional. The whole staff was friendly and informative.   A pleasure to go and we will be back again."
You get to feed the monkeys,October 2018,30,Monkey Jungle,ronaldw8200,"It's a long way from Downtown about 10 miles from the Zoo. You are in the cage and the monkeys are over and around you. $30 a person. free parking, you will buy monkey food. Plan an hour it's not that big but it's pretty much all shaded."
Fun and adventurous time,November 2018,40,Monkey Jungle,933cindyf,"We got there when they opened. Made all the shows. Buy the monkey food. It is cool to watch the monkeys pull up the chain to get the food in the little cup. You can't touch then. We didn't do the Rain Forest Adventure. We stayed approx. 2-3 hours. A little disappointed in the gift shop. Wanted to buy my granddaughter a t shirt 2T and my grandson a 4T. Informed a new stock was coming soon. Enjoyed the atmosphere, monkeys, the staff. Everyone was professional,knowledgeable and nice."
Feeding monkeys,December 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,Walmart955,This place is a great to spend a few hours there.  The monkeys are so smart. They have bowls that you put the food in and they will pull the chains up to get the food.  They are in the open and you are in a cage tunnel.
Auto Show,November 2015,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,David O,The Miami Beach Convention Center has enough room in side you could fit a foot ball stadium inside.Bath rooms are well lite and maintained.The staff ways help full in getting directions correct.Parking is all ways ample.Close to shops and restaurants that you can go to after any event.Near the beach for a nice moon lite stroll.
Miami Beach International Antique Show,January 2016,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,GeorgeP177,"Appr. 1000 Exhibitors and stands! Billions of USD value! Museal pieces! Old watches, jewelliers, furnitures, gold, silver, diamonds from every part of the world! Many pieces several thousands of years old!  It is not possible to see everything, even of You visit the show 2-3 days! I believe this event is the greatest antique show of the world."
Scheduled to be torn down.,February 2016,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,Motherofchildren,We are all very excited about plans for a new convention center. The old one has seen better days. Fortunately the security is better than it used to be but the facility is dated. 
"Drab, sprawling place without many amenities",January 2016,20,Miami Beach Convention Center,AAMiles,"This convention center doesn't have many amenities (bathrooms, food options), and signage is not very good for such a big place.  It's a necessary evil if you have to participate in a convention here.  Just know it's not going to be one of the better ones.  There used to be a great restaurant across the street, Oo-lite, but it closed in 2015, so the food options in the immediate area are not as good as they used to be."
Fantastic Photography!,February 2016,50,Lik Miami,eshattuck,"Peter Lik's photography is magical and each piece takes you on a different journey.  The gallery is well spaced and easy to navigate.  To my mind, it was more like a museum than a gallery.  I'm still dreaming about the aspens, my favorite pieces."
Great Gallery,January 2016,50,Lik Miami,Marcia G,This is one of my favorite places to stop in when strolling on Lincoln Road. The photography is just stunning.
Interesting art work,March 2016,40,Lik Miami,Domenicd2000,Pop in at this Gallery to view some wonderful art work and pieces for sale.  Lighting within is great to view pieces
"Whats there not to ""Lik"" about?",March 2016,40,Lik Miami,diana p,"Sister of the Lik gallery of Key West. The visitor gets an eyeful of stupendous color and scope. I particularly liked the more demure works of a forest in the north contrasting with Lik's exuberant photos of urban gems and the great mountains. A heavy concentration on natural beauty and huge dimensions. If you don't have quite the budget there are smaller formats for thoughtful gifts in the hundreds of dollars range. The ambiance in Miami Beach is museum-like, free to stroll around and admire."
I love (and want) everything in here,March 2016,50,Lik Miami,teeveepro,"Some of the prices for these photographs might be surprising, but the quality and beauty is so good that it's worth it."
Shop til you drop,July 2013,50,8th Street Designer District,Nilda M,My husband and I had to get out of there before we spent all of our money. Just about every designer you could think of. Loved it make sure you bring lots of money to shop! Also great 4th go July sales!
Great for children’s experience ,May 2018,40,Miami Children's Museum,jhonq,"Great museum for children, full of activities for the babies. My daughter loved it and made many friends "
Worth the trip!  Rain or shine.,May 2018,50,Miami Children's Museum,Kenneth G,This was a Top 10 from what we’ve seen in the U.S.  Great job Miami!
Hours of fun for the kids.,June 2018,30,Miami Children's Museum,SamKHealy,Enjoy!!
great for kids,May 2018,50,Miami Children's Museum,lalocadr19,"Went her with my family, great time for anyone looking to spend few hours with family, plenty of area to explore, The building and activity area were the best for me. The museum offer senior discount and discount for 2 years or younger. Plenty of fun for kids."
Neat fun packed little museum for kids,July 2018,50,Miami Children's Museum,megandunmire,This musesum has activities for children of all ages. My kids are 5 and 8 and they both had a blast. they offer a FL resident discount so its very affordable. We spent about 5 hours there and really got to enjoy everything. All of the exhibits arw interactive and even the adults can enjoy a few. I would highly this place for a day of family fun. 
The Bass,March 2018,30,The Bass,David E,A small museum so you definitely do it in an hour.  Interesting contemporary artists were on exhibition.  Some older works mixed in with modem works.
Delightful and thought provoking...but TINY!,February 2018,50,The Bass,Leo M,"That said, the museum was quite delightful with a mix of video, sculpture, and mixed media installations.  I most appreciated the Asian shopkeeper videos and my wife the clown sculptures - though I'm sure the exhibits change. So long as you understand that this is a 60-90 minute experience you'll be happy. Oh...and that if you are used to MoMA the Bass's 'cafe' and 'store' are proportioned accordingly."
Modern art,March 2018,40,The Bass,Lonestarbc,Modern art isn’t everyones idea of art and within the nomenclature there are many types. At the Bass it was fairly radical off-the-wall static and video art. The building and small park are also very nice and we enjoyed it
Modern Contemporary,February 2018,30,The Bass,hotelsnob_68,"This museum did not wow me. However, the staff was very friendly and it's a beautiful museum (aesthetically). When I visited there was an exhibit with a room full of full-size clowns sitting on the floor. It was very  creepy. I'm guessing that was what the artist intended?"
Small Museum but Packs a Big Punch,March 2018,50,The Bass,mjsheridan130,"A few blocks from the crazy South Beach is this little art oasis. When I visited, only the first floor was open, but the exhibitions I saw were simply fantastic. I was blown away with how well it was curated. The museum itself is beautiful and a great facility overall. Any art lover must make a stop here during their trip."
A Tourist Place.,March 2018,50,Bayfront Park,advicer,"Many Restaurants by the Bay, and Shopps, plus small specialty booths runs throught.  You may dine, take a boat ride to the Islands of the Rich and Famous, or just relax with Music Bands, usually Caribbean beat playing at night, while people dance (free) around the Stage near the Water. Use comfortable sport cloth and shoes, relax, nice ambiance mostly tourist.   .     "
Hot in August,August 2018,40,Bayfront Park,00buck,Got off the metromover at this stop and walked through park to the water.  Once you get to the water there are some benchs with some much needed shade and a breeze
Have a break and admire the bikinis,September 2018,50,Bayfront Park,619jeffry,"Bayside Park is on Miami Beach, it's a great place to take a break and watch the surf. You can admire the beach, but you will probably admire the bikini girls, for which the beach is famous, more. Places to have a drink or a meal abound."
Always a great place to chill,September 2018,50,Bayfront Park,992b_lintc,"Always a great place to be, to just sit around and watch the ships go by, or to grab some light snack, even to enjoy a chilled beer in the evening."
Nice place to visit see the beach and nearby shopping district,October 2018,40,Bayfront Park,Johnbw56,"It’s Miami beach, it’s clean well maintained and looked after. Not that busy or overcrowded, just nice to stroll around and admire all thats nearby."
Oasis in the midst of bustling centre ,April 2017,40,Soundscape Park,tushar_pai,"One street away from Lincoln road that is ever so bustling, this uniquely designed park is on Washington Av but can be a very relaxing and cool place. Situated next to New World Symphony Centre, the garden can provide access to the music concert that's happening inside. If you are looking for a place to rest your feet after all the shopping nearby, head to this place."
Breathtaking place,May 2016,50,Soundscape Park,carolinafrota,"If you are a photo lover, visit this park. It has an amazing design mixed with beautiful flowers. Snap it all!"
Great Addition to Miami Beach,June 2017,50,Soundscape Park,Boudecca,This wonderfully designed park contiguous to Miami Beach offers a bit of quiet enjoyment in the midst of Miami Beach.  Check the local schedules as there are often outdoor events here.  
Needs one of these in every city,May 2017,50,Soundscape Park,seanoldinho,"Found out about this place online and that every Tuesday they show a free outdoor movie on a huge screen. Clearly it helps if the weather is good and it was perfect when we went. They also give out free popcorn although we didn't like this very much - cant complain as its all free. Take some snacks, take a towel or something to lie or sit on and chill. There's ice cream within a 10 min walk and restaurants nearby for after. Great night out that doesn't have to cost a penny."
"Interesting, but small",July 2017,30,Soundscape Park,NanaFio,I did not stop--I thought this was someone's private garden.  Did not realize that this is a tourist attraction.
Miami Must-see,August 2018,50,Calle Ocho,sarahb3n,"This is a wonderful little Cuban street you'll come across on any tour of the city. Great place to walk around, buy cigars, get some cuban coffee, take a picture with one of the roosters, etc. Highly recommend!"
A graet place to visit. This was in 2013 NOT 2018,November 2018,40,Calle Ocho,Rickowner," Nice area and friendly people. We found a great restaurant there, named Mama Rosa. SO nice staff/owners"
Main Street in Little Havana,February 2019,50,Calle Ocho,Wombling_Free_7548,Plenty of on street parking for $1.75 an hour up to a maximum of 3 hours.
Amazing  experience!,February 2019,50,Calle Ocho,Pilotprivate,Miami is a great place to experience Latin culture! It's a must to visit Little Havana and Ball and Chains! Try freshly made cigars and just walk the night away with beautiful people and nice and warm weather. 
An Easy Walk and full of life,February 2019,50,Calle Ocho,rml01752,"By all means, include this walk in your Miami plans. If you like authentic Cuban vibes, enjoy the cigar culture, you have to visit. There are some touristy areas, but for the most part, this is a great place to hang out, have some Cuban eats -- especially the coffee -- and hang out and smoke some well made cigars. Be advised, you still cannot get Cuban cigars, but those that are sold are very good."
Miami Open 2019,March 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,Lawtwle,"Make sure you have easy walking shoes. Please do not bring a purse or backpack, it is not aloud.Only plastic  bags aloud, and available for free at the designated trailer outside on the parking lot. No costs."
Miami Open Was So Much Better in Key Biscayne,March 2019,10,Hard Rock Stadium,John R,Overall a very dissapointing experience that left us longing for Key Biscayne.
Miami Open 2018 vs 2019,March 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,MaxwellWade,"Organizers should consider if a four sided stadium could be temporarily be created on the grounds outside the stadium, but would have to forego the luxury seats offered this year."
New venue for Miami Open Tennis tournament,March 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,debbie78740,We attended 3 days of the Miami Open at this facility & it was awesome. The venue was easy to get around & a very pleasant place to attend this great tournament.
Great.,April 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,Brian D,I have no issue recommending a visit to the Hard Rock. Great place to see a game or show. Easy to get to and get out of.

Nice shoping and restaurants,June 2017,40,Village of Merrick Park,JoseGGoncalvesR,The mall is nicely outlayed in a sort of outdoors tipe of mall; nice shops and beautifull people. Plenty of restaurants to choose from
A great upscale addition to the Coral Gables shopiing scene,July 2017,40,Village of Merrick Park,Steve N,Love to shop at the department stores as well as smaller shops. The mall does a great job at Christmas and there is good restaurant variety.
Shopping made easy,July 2017,50,Village of Merrick Park,Joe Z,"Merrick park is a low ke, comfortable shopping experience. With anchor stores Nordstrom and Nieman the mall has everything you could need."

Unique site to have a picnic while enjoying awesome music,March 2015,50,New World Symphony,DojiMiamia,"This is a Unique site to have a picnic while enjoying awesome music performed by the New World Symphony Orchestra. The sound system is amazing and on the Wallcast you can see, not only great performances but commentaries and interviews made to the director and musicians."
Great Vevue,October 2014,50,New World Symphony,genaroa305,The outdoor concert plaza and projection space is simply brilliant.
Wallcast a must,April 2015,50,New World Symphony,PMVW,"Bring your lawn chairs and enjoy a free night of music and picnicking.  There are only 800 seats in the concert hall, but that was great as well.  I liked the community feel of the wallcast."
Picture perfect place,September 2018,40,Venetian Pool,960marikak,"Staff was friendly and there was a lifeguard on duty. Dressing room and restroom were clean and well-kept. There was also a little bar where you could buy icecream, snacks and drinks. "
Gorgeous Venetian Pool in Coral Gables,November 2017,50,Venetian Pool,Paula W,"This pool is such a fabulous find! Complete with palm trees and picnic area, very family oriented and lovely old black and white photographs adorning the entrance area. A fabulous place for a cool swim and great place to take photos."
"Gorgeous pool, great for families",August 2018,50,Venetian Pool,Bridget H,My 3yo son could not stop talking about how much he loved the Venetian Pool! We spent an entire Sunday here and despite having to pay the tourist tax we felt it was well worth the price of admission. Bring your own lunch and snacks to avoid the lines and mediocre food in the cafe. Just beautiful and refreshingly cool water.
Worth stopping by for,April 2018,40,Venetian Pool,Rik E,This pool is a beautiful sight to behold. Pricing to go for a swim is somewhat exaggerated but I assume this is needed for maintenance and for keeping the place from getting swarmed with tourists. Parking can be challengeing.
Great place for nice and peaceful relaxing :),September 2018,50,Venetian Pool,Experience817020,"Beautiful, peaceful, not much expensive.. On weekends it can be busier, but you can still find a place to enjoy and relax. The only thing that I didn't like was a coffee shop (they didn't have nor milk nor cream for the coffee)."
Just spectacular- a lot of nature and one hell of a prohibition cellar,August 2018,50,Deering Estate,anabellepaulino,Walked around the grounds and loved seeing so much green in miami- hard to find. By the water so very relaxing. Fascinating history of the place and Mr. Deering. Local history is hard to find in Miami. Also took a tour of the prohibition cellar and it is one of a kind. To think it was constructed and used as a liquor (Mostly) wine cellar during the prohibition. Very well kept and looking forward to a wine tasting they have coming up in November.
Beauty of nature close to the concrete jungle. ,September 2018,50,Deering Estate,Annette T,If you have been to Viscaya make sure to visit to see a quiet piece of paradise.  While standing near the harbor there is only a view of green and no concrete or condos in view. 
CANOE TRIP WAS AMAZING!,September 2018,50,Deering Estate,maydahurtado,Aimee love what they do and it shows.
Superb photo opportunity.,September 2018,50,Deering Estate,ljt123,Photographing the Fall Equinox at the Deering Estate is an event local photographers always look forward.  This and many other events are hosted by Jessica who does a wonderful job of hosting monthly events at Deering.  She always makes sure that the sun rises in exactly the right position very year for the Equinox!!!  You can also photography sunrises monthly at the estate..check the site for dates.  I have am so thankful that Jessica is willing to give of her time so we participate in this event.  I have been photographing this and other sunrises at the Estate for years..Every sunrise is different and beautiful. So thankful we have this opportunity.
Not As Impressive,September 2018,30,Deering Estate,6_Speed_Automatic,"If you have been to Viscaya, you may want to pass on the Deering Estate. When approaching via US1, traffic can be very madding just north of the estate. Once there, the main focus are two medium sized houses with a large boat basin with a view to Biscayne Bay. Picnic tables are available to enjoy the views with your self supplied snack or lunch.  One of the artist studios had an open sign, but the doors were pad locked. I didn’’t find any large landscaped gardens."
Great for bike riding and cooling down!,April 2016,40,Collins Park,Dengony,"There is a bike rack very near the Collins Pk area, so you can have a great time riding.  I find it a better space to lay under a tree for shade and relax.  It's not as touristy as other areas, like near the strip, so you'll have relative peace and quiet to rest on the grass.  I don't remember seeing any dogs so you won't have to worry about any surprises underneath you!  "
Collins Ave: the main Street in Miami,August 2015,50,Collins Park,TourGuide-Manager,The Collins Park area was land donated to the city by John Collins the first developer of Miami Beach. The stone building in the park was originally the John Collins Memorial Library when it was dedicated in 1930 but is now part of the Bass Museum.  
Best experience ever,December 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,Bri3344,This is the best animal encounter I’ve ever experienced. The staff are all very kind and the landscape is beautiful ! I recommend doing the monkey tour! You get to get up close and personal with all the monkeys !
Great time and informative,January 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,itsadogslife717,"The spider monkeys and gibbons will make you just watch in awe. The crab eating/Java macaques are funny and get into quite a few skirmishes. They all except treats that you purchase in the gift shop. The Wings of Love parrots were so much fun, and they also like to interact with you. As I am a huge animal advocate, I felt all the animals were well cared for, enclosures were all super clean and seemed happy. I would definitely return."
Loved the monkeys,December 2018,40,Monkey Jungle,Samantha C,"We pad a lot of extra money to go inside the jungle area and feed the monkeys. It was way too expensive we thought, but I wouldn't have gone if we didn't do this as the rest of the place was just okay, not a huge amount to do. The monkeys were very cute, and they come and eat the food right out of your hands. "
So much fun!!!,January 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,ergneb,"The place is not huge, but we still spent 4 hours there. We took our 21 yr old granddaughter who was visiting. We didn't do the Rainforest Experience, but we had a great time!  The presentations were not long, but were very informative. King, the Silverback Gorilla was a riot.  He has such an attitude that you can 't help but laugh.  He is quite intelligent and responds to the guides with sign language . The rest of the monkeys were so entertaining. The Gibbons are amazing.  Comment: food offered at the one venue is just hot dogs and pizza, so don't plan on a meal there.   Really a fun afternoon!"
Loved it.,October 2018,50,Monkey Jungle,marieregina,We are in the vet business and one of our techs brother worked here so we wanted to visit. I thought it was nice and the animals were well taken care of. 
The Convention Center is currently under remodeling.,April 2016,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,dalepenn,"Remodeling should be completed by December 2017. It has been home to Political Party Conventions, Championship Boxing Matches and Art Basel. Its new replacement has been the source of a bit of local controversy over the appropriate size (indeed the appropriateness at all) of a convention center hotel. After 10 years of planning, this issue is still under debate."
Convenient,February 2016,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,PeruTrav,"There are so many events along the year, one of my favorites is the Boat Show where you can enjoy all the models, sizes and people who come from all USA and other countries."
Car show and Art Basel is the only thing important,June 2016,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,JerryAscione,"And those are pricey events. The rest of the year it suits smaller events and acts. To be honest the place needs to be re done. It's older and needs a good rehab, not just a fresh coat of paint. Parking is a mess in this area. The gaffes across the street charge an arm and a leg to park during special events. "
Florida supercon 2016,July 2016,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,Mariela V,It is awesome! Ir is sold out! The place it is safe to come! I recommend to come without car! Because parking it is expensive! The event is I is until July 4th
SUPERCON COULD HAVE BEEN SUPER,July 2016,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,Dianne E,"I went to Supercon 2016 because my son and husband are big comic book fans and I wanted to see what all they hype was about.  First, I felt it was poorly organized.  While they did pull in some well known celebrities, there were some there the younger kids had no idea who they were, which were the early Star Trek actors.  One of the actors sat reading a magazine because no one knew who he was.  Then there was the ""No photographs"" rule.  I stood by where Henry Winkler was and the fans were not aware you could go and talk to him for free!  The prices for just an autograph were outrageous, at $40-50 each.  Take that with the $40 entry for just one day and you're already at $100.  And if you decide to dress like a character, there's more money involved.  The food prices were a little high as well. Paying $8.00 for a hotdog is highway robbery. Add a drink and chips and you could have had a nice dinner at a steakhouse.  The Cosplay was neat but we had no idea where the competitions were.  Then in the program they listed video games on the 2nd floor.  I ""assumed"" this meant games for sale.  Instead, they had a bunch of outdated computer monitors set up on a long table for kids to play games.  Pretty lame.  I didn't travel 200 miles and 2=3 hours for my kid to play games on a 1980's monitor.  We arrived on a friday to go to the show on Saturday.  Unfortunately tickets were sold out so we opted to pay for another hotel and go on Sunday.  There was barely anyone there!  That, to me, is not good planning.  Some of the celebs were leaving Sunday night due to the smaller crowds even though the event went on until Monday, the 4th.  The charge for the four day event was like $100.  Personally, after just being there for the day Sunday, I don't know what there would be to do for the entire 4 days.  Hopefully they will get some reviews and improve on some of these areas.Just poorly organized, in my and my family's opinion.  It was more like a glorified flea market"
LOVE Peter Like photos!,May 2016,50,Lik Miami,carolmG7679YD,"Although this gallery shows the same pieces as all of his other galleries, we did not feel accosted when we entered the gallery.  The sales person showed us a few of her favorites and we got to cool off from the 102 degrees outside.  "
Great artist. Nature captured beautifully ,June 2016,50,Lik Miami,rachael1107,I very much enjoy Peter Lik photos. The gallery is well located and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. There are a variety of natural scenes from around the world as well as some aviation. My favorite are the trees that he captures. A definite must see for anyone who likes photography 
Beautiful,June 2016,50,Lik Miami,KDRMT,Great location among the shops on Lincoln Rd. A welcome break and beautiful photography to inspire adventure. 
Breathtaking,July 2016,50,Lik Miami,honeym_11,It's no wonder the photographer doesn't identify the location of where the pictures were taken as one can imagine themself in all of the locations. Simply stunning. 
Don't miss this gallery while walking down Lincoln Road,July 2016,50,Lik Miami,AldebaranFlorida,"Lincoln Road has terrific shops and restaurants and is well worth the few hours it takes to explore all it has to offer.  During a recent trip, we stopped by Peter Lik's Gallery for the first time.  Amazing photographs, definitely some of the best I've ever seen.  Don't miss this gallery!"
Shop till you drop,January 2014,40,8th Street Designer District,The_1st_Lady,"Designer, hip and very fashionable.  Were the trendy go to be seen and pick up the latest in fashion.  It's easy to be tempted to buy something very Miami only probably to never wear it again.  Great fun to people watch."
Money and time to burn?,September 2014,40,8th Street Designer District,Ron M,"If you have money and time to burn, you might consider hanging out at the 8th St Designer District during your South Beach vacation. My wife and I went to look for me some cool looking long sleeve button downs. I got most of my shirts from Banana Republic. My wife just had to buy some perfume from Dash to commemorate the Kardashians. I got some new swim shorts and t-shirts at Quicksilver. You can't go wrong with air conditioned stores in the Miami Beach heat!"
Girls getaway,September 2014,50,8th Street Designer District,ebonymonique1,Had an awesome time lying on the beach and Cody with Boucher brothers was super attentive.  Would definitely return! 
Very fascinating district,June 2014,50,8th Street Designer District,Rosario_it,It is a very safe area also at the night.
Well preserved structures,August 2014,40,8th Street Designer District,Isoto620,Very colorful and well preserved. Lot of people around. You can walk to other streets easily.  Lots of places to eat.  Food is pricey but you can enjoy the place.  Definitely will visit again.  
Kids love this place,August 2018,40,Miami Children's Museum,562aashishp,A nice place to spend time with your child. lots of interactive activities and games. Price is about $ 7.50 per head if you enter at 5 pm. There is a subway restaurant in the same building. Lots of parking spaces for about $1 per hour.
Happy Eid! It was agood experience,August 2018,50,Miami Children's Museum,Fragranceabood,"We went there with a 4 year old boy to please him for the Eid day. We like that it has a plenty of choices to imitate. He loved fishing and sailing tho boats the most. We loved the Gym . It would be great if you have more than one kid to take them to, and don’t worry, they will spend the whole day playing and they won’t get enough. It is not so expendive and it worths coming to, don’t miss it "
Great outing for children,August 2018,50,Miami Children's Museum,alexenbergmoshe,"Love this museum. Take my children often. Ages 9, 7, 6, 3. Something for them all. They change up the activities and the displays often although not often enough. Great place. Lots more potential. Good for a full day of fun"
Good for young kids,June 2018,40,Miami Children's Museum,Ackbar,More eating options please!
Worth the visit!,June 2018,50,Miami Children's Museum,Farah G,This is worth the trip. We stayed in FLL and traveled for the day to the musem. There's enough to do for the entire day with no chance of the kids getting bored.
"Beautiful space, some gems, but small museum",May 2018,40,The Bass,robertC500QC,They also have a snack bar and a lovely courtyard. The space itself is very welcoming and there are some gems here. I recommend it for the small museum aficionado.  If you are expecting something like MOMA then you will be disappointed.
Love it!!,October 2017,50,The Bass,meljimenez84,"This is the best affordable art museum on Miami beach. Not only is it an awesome place to work but it is a privilege to be in this place to see all different kinds of art from different points of view, I love how the art changes around every few months."
always a great visit,March 2018,50,The Bass,RifkaRM,"I hear Miami and I think of the Bass (I know other people think of beach and other stuff), and I wonder what it might have next. Everytime I´ve been there I´ve seen wonderful, interesting and bold exhibits, I love this place its an absolute must!!! and its location is great on South Beach, so you can have beach AND art :) "
Modern Art Museum,July 2018,40,The Bass,HeatherMK712,"If you are one who appreciates modern and interpretive art, this is an excellent museum to visit.  While I am not an avid modern art enthusiast; this museum does have a nice collection of art.  It takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 and half hours to visit.  "
Family Day: Elevator Broken,July 2018,10,The Bass,pablocM5106OW,"I'm the organizer of a photography group in Miami and we have a few Disable folks, last Sunday we went to the museum and we were expecting much more than there was, first there was not much to see and the main elevator was broken, how can you have a family day and not have the elevator working, it makes no sense...this was a free day I can not imagine paying $10 for such a poor place....not worth it,,,don't waste your time on this venue"
Close to the Hotel and a nice Place,November 2018,40,Bayfront Park,Cottonelle,"Not being from these parts, this was a pleasant oasis within walking distance of our hotel. It offers a nice walk around the harbour. It was a clean well kept area. "
Very Pretty,November 2018,40,Bayfront Park,evanspeggy,"My daughter was in the process of driving past this park and I asked her to stop and lets take a short stroll. The weather was great, the patrons were friendly and we had a lovely scenic view. I think if anyone is looking for pretty scenery they will like this park."
New Year Bash!,January 2019,50,Bayfront Park,Yolanda S,We brought in the New Year listening to Pitbull on the stage at the park. The atmosphere was great! It is near the mall so there are a bunch of things to experience while in the park area!
View of the port of Miami,January 2019,40,Bayfront Park,lotharjuern,In downtown across the port area of cruise ships which usually are in town during the weekend. Nice place to start walk along the beach. 
Beautiful park on the water,January 2019,50,Bayfront Park,Annie143Florida,"The park is great for walking. It's on the water and you can see cruise ships in the distance, and boats sailing by. Adjacent to Bayside Market Place. "
Love it,December 2017,50,Soundscape Park,sham k,"Its not Tanglewood, but its great to have to have it here, Go at least an hour earlier to get a decent space. We usually take a pick nick basket. "
"Beautiful, worth a stop",December 2017,50,Soundscape Park,A_0326,"This park is not big but is it beautiful, you can walk around and take pictures, and on certain nights nights they play movies for free. People bring chairs, blankets and snacks and enjoy movie time."
Enjoyable at any time !,January 2018,50,Soundscape Park,Nicolas B,"Either if you want to enjoy a coffee, a light chat, alone or just chill, this place will suit you.  As a plus, some weekends they offer concerts (wall-cast) of the new world symphony, another plus for the location."
Nice little Park next to New World Center,January 2018,40,Soundscape Park,Halkidis,"Our hotel was near, so we walked couple of times through this nice little Park. Near Convention Center, The Fillmore and next to New World Center. Some restaurants near too, so it was nice to have a lunch and see the Park sametime. Soundscape area of this Park allows visitors experience live, free wallcasts of events throughout the season through the use of visual/audio technology"
"Lights, Cameras & Action!",December 2017,50,Soundscape Park,Loucious,Feel like taking in a movie or a Live Band streaming? Head over to this Fabulous Open Area cinema like park.

Educational and Fun,May 2018,40,Calle Ocho,Gina T,"Both my husband and I enjoyed by bus, the touring throughout Miami districts. Calle Ocho was especially memorable. Muy criolla and rich in culture. We both enjoyed our trip ti Miami and all we had a chance to see."
So interesting and great way to get a taste of Havana!,April 2019,50,Calle Ocho,bpask,Traveled with the Hop on hope off bus and got off here.  Great restaurants and have to see Domino Park
Tourist trap,March 2019,10,Calle Ocho,Monika K,"I’m sorry,but this street Calle Ocho is tourist trap,nothing to do with Cuba,...if you’re visiting some of the restaurant the food is terrible and service not even better,..visit downtown Miami and you can get better Cuban food,...and cigars? You can buy cigars on South beach less expensive,.../everything it’s overpriced,be careful!/."
Great Stadium!,October 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Estuardo_Santillan,We went to see the Peru-Chile game... and our tickets were upgraded to the suites... the restaurant inside... just great... great game... great location....
Party Stadium,December 2018,50,Hard Rock Stadium,MrD305,Beautiful Stadium in an up-and-coming community. Many places to shop and grab a quick bite to eat. Walmart is conveniently across the street too.
Very disappointing concert venue.,August 2018,30,Hard Rock Stadium,Parrotheadjoe,"We were at this venue to see Jimmy Buffett and the Eagles perform. I attend a lot of music concerts every year and pretty much know what to expect at large venues like the Hard Rock Stadium but this one was extremely ridiculous. Once inside the stadium and past the security checkpoint we had fifteen minutes to make our field seating area. Once we arrived at the field we were told we needed wristbands to go to our seats. We were told to go to isle entry 129-130 to get onto the field. After getting over there we waited in line with about four hundred other people that were also trying to get to their field seats. As it turned out, there were no wristbands there and the Buffett part of the concert had already been underway for ten minutes. We were told that we would have to go back down to the entrance and there we would find someone giving out the wristbands. We did this and had to stand in a single line about a hundred feet long where two people at a table were working feverishly to check tickets and strap on wristbands! Once we stood in that line for fifteen minutes we had to return to isle entry 129/130 and wait there for another twenty minutes before we could get on the field and to our seats. It was eight o’clock before we were seated in our seats and Buffett had already played for an hour which meant that we only got to enjoy the Buffett part of the show for thirty minutes. They have a very pour management group for such a large "
It's Finally Approaching the Fun of the Old Orange Bowl,December 2018,40,Hard Rock Stadium,David A,"When the stadium was first built, those of us who are old time Canes and Fins fans lamented its sterility -- the crowd was too far from the field. But the renovations have changed that, and a few years ago, when the Canes trounced Notre Dame, the venue showed it can be AS electric as the Orange Bowl on a Saturday night. "
A place to spend some time and a lot of money.,October 2017,50,Village of Merrick Park,BorgoTravel,"Beautiful setting, replete with high-end stores, but with a few mid-level places. Great restaurants, too."

Wallcast Experience Brings Class and Classical Music to South Beach,October 2015,50,New World Symphony,E8651CXmargaretm,"Attended our first Saturday evening Wallcast of the New World Symphony with a program of Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky!  Getting there more than an hour before the concert was a very good idea.  We spread out, enjoyed a picnic, sipped a glass of wine and let the music wash over us as the stars came out.  The incredible surround-sound system transports the music straight to the soul.  Watching this gifted, young orchestra left us with a feeling of hope for the future of classical music in America.  And to think, all of this was free.  Doesn't get any better than this on a beautiful night in Miami Beach."
If you love music the New World Wall-Cast offers a FREE outside showing of what the Symphony is playing inside.,November 2015,50,New World Symphony,Charles M,"We attended last Saturday night, November 7th, 2015 and watched and listened to Telemann and Handel music conducted by Paul Goodwin and the evening was magical and FREE for the attendees outside.  Lawn chairs, picnic baskets, children were all a part of the event.  And did I say FREE?  YES.   Do not say you do not like classical music until you try this event."
Spectacular place ,December 2015,50,New World Symphony,Jose R. S,"Nice and relaxing place, fantastic sound and amazing screen, next to Lincoln Road, restaurants and cafes . Great experience "

The most beautiful public pool,November 2018,50,Venetian Pool,Kerry B,"We spent a hot afternoon here. It is just beautiful. The caves were a big hit with the kids. We went midweek so finding a lounger was not hard but I would imagine at peak times it would pay to be early. Changing rooms, lockers and food was available."
Mr and mrs,January 2019,10,Venetian Pool,112gg,Not open for maintenance. Went on purpose.  No water on pool. Gates locked. Pretty.  Open sometime in February according to signs.
Great Treasure in Coral Gables,September 2018,50,Venetian Pool,Andy M,Beautiful pool in residential area of Coral Gables. The water is cold but it is worth it to spend a relaxing day in a beautiful atmosphere. Beware as the pool closes part of the year in the winter. Kids love it and you can bring your books and music and have a great relaxing day!
Nothing but just another pool.,November 2018,10,Venetian Pool,ssaini,"This place did not live up to its expectations. It is nothing more than a pool, just another pool. Probably your hotel pool would be better than this."
Summer Day,August 2018,40,Venetian Pool,nibaldom2015,Was here with the family and still as wonderful as ever. This is a tranquil but unusually beautiful place. The water here is cold but if your here in the middle of summer you will find it refreshing. This is a place you must visit while in Miami during the summer. Enjoy
ANOTHER GEM,June 2018,40,Deering Estate,Marshall I,Enjoy.
"Lame, not worth it",December 2018,10,Deering Estate,northvillelady,"Extremely lame and boring, nothing going on there. Many furnishings and decorations from Pottery Barn."
Nice place but not worth going out of the way to see,December 2018,30,Deering Estate,EJE123,"The Deering Estate consists of a historic estate and associated grounds. The trails and most of the grounds were closed when we visited. There are some great views looking out towards the water. The house itself is nice, but nothing that is a ""must see"" attraction. For the holidays, various sponsors like Pottery Barn decorated the place to showcase their merchandise. While the decorations worked and matched the house, a lot of the displays felt like extended ads for the sponsors. If you are going to only see one historic estate and grounds, go to Vizcaya instead."
The view was just amazing!,December 2018,50,Deering Estate,F J,"We did a crusie and it nice! The weather was perfect, the tour guide really knew his history and was very entertaining. I would recommend adding this to your list if you are in Miami. The place was amazing!"
Prohibition Era Cellar Series Distillery Old St Pete,January 2019,50,Deering Estate,raulc21,What a great time we had at this special speakeasy event. It was so unique to dress the part and try the different drinks and paired with the little bites all in the estates hidden vault. Can’t wait to do another one. Thanks for being so creative in producing this wonderful series. 
SOBE at it's nicest....,June 2016,40,Collins Park,kevinparsakia,I came to miami and explored collins park for a couple training runs. Nice area but the homeless tend to worry me at early morning. It's a great little secret of miami beach that everyone should explore.  It's pretty safe for the most part and very close to alot of the hotels.
Interesting.,March 2016,40,Collins Park,oceans3,See the sights of South Beach by walking along and through Collins Park.  Be careful of people on bikes!
sweet,October 2016,50,Collins Park,mario v,very nice to run or walk while enjoying the Miami beach scenery. the park goes on forever so bring water and prepare for the hot and humid Miami beach weather. recommended
A relaxing park when no exhibits are there.,August 2016,40,Collins Park,risitodeplata,"I have read some of the reviews and I am not sure they are talking about Collins Park.  This has Collin ave. run thru it and is between 21st and 22nd street.  On the East side of Collins Ave. the park is between hotels north and south and the beach board walk on the east.  This area is just an open park most of the time, but when there are events such as swim week there are usually tents set up for the exhibits.  The west side of Collins park is surrounded by the City Library, condos and the Ballet and The Bass Museum.  This area can just be open, but when events are at the Beach they many times set up exhibits here.  A quick and easy place to see."
Relaxing!,October 2016,50,Collins Park,André N,The Collins Park Neighborhood in Miami Beach sits on the north eastern point of the South Beach Historic District.

Expensive but fun,March 2019,40,Monkey Jungle,Robin K,We didn’t have kids with us but the kids who were there seemed to be having a ball feeding the monkeys
Returned with Kids over 10 years later!,February 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,Moonbird,"My husband and I found Monkey Jungle when we first went to Miami/Key Largo in 2006.  We loved it!  Once we had kids and were able to travel easier, we wanted to take them.  We go to Miami once per year for the boat show now due to work.  Unfortunately, last year they were closed due the hurricane when we wanted to go, but this year they were open.  We and our boys (9,6) loved it again.  This time we did the rainforest tour and really enjoyed it.  Although it is expensive, we highly recommend it.  The monkeys are so sweet.  We did the noon tour, and could tell that later in the day, the monkeys in the regular part of the zoo were not too hungry anymore.  Also, the swimming monkeys were not interested in going after their eggs at the later show.  But, if you stay until later in the day, you can hear and see the gibbons swinging around crazy and singing.    Great experience."
Nice wildpark for a day out,August 2018,40,Monkey Jungle,Rinze P,"Despite the showery day we had a fun time at the Wildpark Monkey Jungle. Monkeys enjoy a lot of freedom, where the visitors are the one that are actually caged. Feeding the monkeys using the chained bowls and the plastic tubes added some extra fun. The animals seem to be happy in their jungle-like environment and are fed regularly. At feeding time the rangers are prepared to answer any question and show passion for their job. We really enjoyed the four hours we spend at the park."
Versatile Venue,September 2016,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,marbelys m,"I have been to the convention center for the auto show, art and home show and the latest was supercon. This is a very nice space and versatile venue. Supercon this year could've been better organized but my friends and I really enjoyed it either way. "
Medium Sized conventions,September 2016,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,martinbollers,"Visited the Miami convention centre for an annual food and beverage show. I find movement and from the convention centre simple and easy to understand. There is WI Fi available, lots of rest rooms and easy transportation. It is also relatively safe."
on construction since 1971,October 2016,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,mario v,this place is huge on the inside with all kinds of messed up directions. Has been in construction since i can remember. they usually host a lot of marathons event and the car show.
It is being renovated,December 2015,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,ADRsr,When its finished it will be great.
Conventional but why not ?,December 2015,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,diana p,"Like the proverbial afternoon bridge playing maiden aunt, it is there, it is unexciting, and, yes, like Aunt Lily, you somehow make of it a reference. Our most recent and important contact was at Art Basel and we found the venue a happy mixture between a funhouse and a carefully laid out clinic. Intelligently adapted to the madness of a large art fair, the convention center lets you get just a wee bit lost the time to discover the latest creation of that up and coming Sierra Leone genius whose schtick is painting rhino skin's baby pink and that offshoot of Soho eatery where you can delight in a nettles and organic kale smoothie. OK, I'm laying it on thick, but the point is that the floor plan is adapted for easy circulation and the only negative is the noise, which of course is the wage of popularity. Also, it is not cheap, but there again, there are lots of giveaways and reductions, and well the sort of thing they do in the souks of old. So one can easily fit into one of the many reduced price plans.They have just completed the renovations, interesting ... we'll have a look soon."
Different place.,September 2016,40,Lik Miami,mmmatos,"Never saw so different photos and quality in one gallery like that. Expenses photos, but they are so beautiful."
Exploring...,October 2016,40,Lik Miami,lptsLifestyle,Photography perfection. Pieces are amazing. Prices are more for the high end purchaser however. The piece I loved and would fit my color scheme was a cool $25k 
Incredible talent,October 2016,50,Lik Miami,Mystro2015,Stunning Art work not to be missed if not to purchase then feast your eyes on these amazing pictures?
Fascinating Photos,October 2016,40,Lik Miami,Steve H,"Take a few minutes while strolling in the Lincoln Road are to stop by the Gallery, (no charge).  It is clear that Peter Lik is an amazing and talented Photographer."
If you like photography - its a must!,March 2016,40,Lik Miami,anabellepaulino,If you are by lincoln road and love breath taking photography please stop by here. The lighting is spectacular for viewing. The pictures are one of a kind and I love the large canvas style.
So much to see ,July 2015,50,8th Street Designer District,niyamatmehta,One amazing artistic place in this magnificent place is this which opened my eyes and helped me to be more creative. It has fantastic food and small cafeterias. I LOVE IT SO MUCH
"Artistic Wall Drawings, Designs and Buildings Beyond Belief",December 2015,40,8th Street Designer District,Joanna K,"We did NOT go for the shopping but to see the WALLS and all the magnificent drawings and graffiti scattered throughout the Design District. This used to be an old run down warehouse district that is being rejuvenated with many high end shops, galleries, and restaurants. Delicious food can be found on every corner here. But go to see the walls-they are free, fascinating, and fun. An eye opener "
Nothing particularly interesting...,February 2016,30,8th Street Designer District,sannor,"Go every year 2 times, and the shops are  old...could use some new shops..same shops as in NYC or else, if not same, the shops are not much to see"
All your favorite designers,March 2016,30,8th Street Designer District,deyos,"It was what you would expect from a designer district, plenty of designers you would love to see and then there was Dash, the Kadashians business, nothing special there, more of a photo op for the young"
Great for a walk!,April 2016,50,8th Street Designer District,calla813,Lots of stores and not all expensive.  There is a big mall as well.  There is a beautiful courtyard with fountains and old Spanish architecture.  Lots of restaurants as well.  Go in the evening too hot in the day! 
Great place for kids!,January 2019,50,Miami Children's Museum,Kenziemarie77,"My daughter loves Miami Children's Museum! Take advantage of the cheaper price as a Dade County resident or if you have a card/account with Bank of America, they offer free museums days here (usually 1st weekend of the month). Fun visit!"
#1 Family Fun,January 2019,50,Miami Children's Museum,woodyg647,"This Museum is a fantastic experience for any family whether a tourist or resident.  14 oermanent newly restored galleries as well as a special area for traveling exhibits.  Love, Love, Love this place!"
"Mostly for little kids, nice to visit",January 2019,50,Miami Children's Museum,Traveltoparadise15,Nice place to spend a couple of hours with children.
A good option for a rainy day,January 2019,40,Miami Children's Museum,Luci-Daher-Laus,"We went to visit Miami Children's Museum on a rainy day. It was the best option to keep our 7 yr old and 1 yr old busy ! They loved all the sections, especially the pet care area. Also, our 7 yr old loved to pretend to work at the seaport. He learned a lot ."
Good for little children,January 2019,30,Miami Children's Museum,LinaBrazil,"This museum is interesting for little children - maybe those over 6 years won't like it. It's small and attractions are not so educational - the purpose is more to entertain. Our 4-year-old liked it. For us, it was a little bit boring. The museum are is nice and we could se many cruise ships from there."
Building up new exhibition ,November 2018,30,The Bass,PetriKoo,The Bass is building up exhibition so there was only Paola Pilvi and Aaron Curry exhibitions open. Those could be seen quite quickly so I suggest visiting when they have all areas open. 
Great little museum! Take the free tour.,November 2018,50,The Bass,Zoe F,"This is a great little museum on Miami Beach. We took the free tour with Andy who gave us lots of great context while also letting us explore on our own. When we visited in November 2018, there was a fantastic exhibit by Paola Pivi upstairs. A nice way to infuse a little culture into a day at the beach."
Quite a surprise !,January 2019,40,The Bass,SteveGoldgap,"Small art museum with fresh, inspiring exhibition of contemporary art. We enjoyed a bit of peace and culture after a few miles walking the beachlife. Nice !"
Such a Fun Gallery,January 2019,50,The Bass,MsSunAndSand,"Great for the kids, too. Loved the sense of wit and deep humanity in the shows on display. Beautiful physical plant to hold big shows with lots of space around the art. Centrally located near South Beach. Will go back for sure. "
A rejuvenated art museum,January 2019,50,The Bass,Pat B,Years ago the Bass Museum was home to a collection of medieval artefacts. Recently it was renovated and has taken on the allure of an art gallery like so many others in SoBe. The exhibits we saw and enjoyed were childlike but uplifting and we took many pictures. The benefit of the museum is it's spacious and bright cafe. The pizza is delicous and highly recommendable.
Nice park until it rains,June 2018,40,Bayfront Park,TMACKSTER,This is a relaxing park where the locals like to walk their dogs. There is limited shelter so if it starts raining you need to head over to Bayside Marketplace until the storm passes.
Nice to sit and watch the world go by,February 2019,50,Bayfront Park,lulukoalabear,"Enjoyed a few trips here, just relaxing with a book or watching the dolphins in the bay.  Nearby to Bayside as well which is nice for shopping. "
Small but worth a look.,February 2019,40,Bayfront Park,dotcho,"Obviously overtaken by the rather garish food and shopping malls so inevitable, but does give a pleasant respite from the city.  Take the riverside walk in the opposite direction and high chance of seeing manatees. "
A total waste of time,March 2019,20,Bayfront Park,AmosC_13,It was a total waste of time.
Nice spot for a walk,March 2019,40,Bayfront Park,CorneCapeTown,"As we stayed in an Airbnb right opposite the park, we walked in the park on a few occasions. It was simply nice to get out of the apartment and walk along the ocean. I would not have driven here specifically, but it was convenient for fresh air and a nice view of the ocean. "
Pack a picnic bag,July 2018,50,Soundscape Park,David T,New world symphony and Miami Beach created a great public space to enjoy the arts.  During season you can watch concerts for free outside.  On Wednesdays there is free movies on the wall. 
Home of New World Symphony Wallcasts,April 2018,50,Soundscape Park,marciaorov,"The Wallcast experience is not to be missed. Bring a picnic, friends and enjoy the setting and the music."
Great Outdoor Concerts,March 2018,50,Soundscape Park,ILoveTraveling2,Sharing a picnic with family and friends while watching and listening to a New World Symphony with MMT has become my favorite thing to do in Miami Beach.  I recommend this to all.
If you’re around Lincoln Rd ,August 2018,40,Soundscape Park,MelBr75,fins as well the New World Center( Performance Hall). 
love the design,September 2018,50,Soundscape Park,Daniela H,"love this place during day time because of its design. You can take great pictures and walk or even take a break. they have benches, I also enjoy this location because it close to restaurants and stores  "
"If you love Cuban food, check it out.",July 2019,40,Calle Ocho,Mzhelen,"Lots of great restaurants, and local artisanal ice cream. A lot of tourists, and all the Hop On Hop Off buses stop here. You need to park on a side street and download the parking app to make it easier to pay, although the parking prices are reasonable."
Cuban History and Cuisine,March 2019,40,Calle Ocho,Ponch84,"You want a great Cuban food, then you must pass visit the heart of the Cuban community back in its hey-day.  Here is where it all started with Cubans and later, Cuban-Americans. Although it has changed significantly since the 60s-80s (more Central and South American emigres) this is Cuba and it will always reflect the Cuban influence and culture within this historic district.  By the way, Marlins Park is centrally located with thin the historic district."
Really the same as Little Havana,July 2019,50,Calle Ocho,LWRFL,"But that being said, there is so much to see, experience, eat and drink here while you learn about the Cuban culture.  Will definitely return."
Be Careful,June 2019,20,Calle Ocho,Tiffany_Horton,"Unfortunately, we encountered someone who was dressed professionally, and offered to take our pictures in an aggressive, friendly manner on this very street. Although this person was not a threat to us, it felt uncomfortable especially in the end when they turned to my husband and said a donation would be accepted. It should have been said up front, and for all in our group to hear."
Food tour a great way to see Calle Ocho Little Havana,July 2019,50,Calle Ocho,597elsar,"I finished doing the food tour down CO and feel like I got a great flavor of the culture. Love  the food, the culture, the art, the music. This is great fun for families, friends, for drinks or ice cream"
Gameday / Event tips,September 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,l_stevegoesthere_l,"The stadium is pretty clean and the staff is very polite, helpful and ready to answer questions. I gave four stars because leaving the venue can be a hassle, but that’s typical of any event with a large crowd. From what I understand the venue is continually working on  parking and egress related issues to find ways to better flow the exiting folks safely. Uber or car service is a good option to get in and out quickly."
Beautiful stadium!,September 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,SMC0133,"The hubby and I came for the Dolphins vs. Patriots game.  The stadium was really nice!  Even though it wasn't a complete dome, the temperature wasn't bad at all for a 1:00 pm game.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!"
Excellent stadium,September 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,18DavidJ18,"We left a bit early as blowout to get Uber but no signs and conflicting information about where the lot really is, we never found it as hit busy road and were able to get a taxi."
"Nice Stadium, roomy and lots of food options!",September 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,Sarah D,"Awesome stadium, great food, parking is a nightmere though only downside... :(....review is only of an NFL game as well..."
Watch Valuables in your Car  /  Theft in Valet parking,March 2018,10,Village of Merrick Park,rgonza7748,"The is supposed to be a reputable place, but apparently not."
Beautiful Buildings Nice Place to Stroll,May 2018,40,Village of Merrick Park,Hialeah73,Great place to take a walk especially after eating at one of the restaurants near by. The parking is not great really valet only unless you arrive early. There is a garage but it fills up fast. Great window shopping or perhaps shopping. But very pricey!
Excellent shopping experience.,May 2018,50,Village of Merrick Park,Noely0216,they all offer excellent customer service and the lastest fashion trends.  Sundays at the place puts you in sensory overload with amazing diplays of smells and states.  Stop by and enjoy!!!!!
Relaxed shopping experience,July 2018,50,Village of Merrick Park,CoralGablesMom1,"This is the antithesis of your everyday mall. It’s a relaxed open aired mall with a great range of stores from Gucci, DVF, Athleta, Victoria Sectret and everything in between. The restaurants are great and a the anchor stores are Nordstrom and Neeiman Marcus which have great sales on occasion."
Very Nice architecture,June 2016,50,New World Symphony,Ricardo35,"Located in a  modern designed park, it is a place to visit. The building is very modern and nice, including a rooftop garden. If you have a chance to take a look inside it is a must."
Great visit. Amazing view ,September 2016,40,New World Symphony,815marct,Definitely recommend this tour. 
"Excellent music, not a bad seat in the house",September 2016,50,New World Symphony,annettefromm,You can also go just for a tour of the building.  The park outside is great for picnics.  Outside wall casts and films are offered often in the winter months.
Actually deserves 10 stars,October 2016,50,New World Symphony,579eugened,Extraordinary building (Garry).  Extraordinary acoustics.  Extraordinary musicianship. Check out their wall cast offering and don't spend a fine.  A true highlight of Miami Beach. 
Get Inside: It is a must see building,December 2016,50,New World Symphony,davidpC6878JH,5. You can see a movie show some nights outside.
Expensive,March 2019,20,Venetian Pool,Jackie C,"I was so excited to come here for the last couple years I finally just got the chance. First it is expensive, it’s smaller then I thought it would be, my son is 11 he could only stay in a small area for his size unless he had a life jacket which is fine but I highly suggest bringing your own because I read they had some and they were all way too big so he was unable to go any further. It did really just feel like an outdoor pool. There isn’t much room to sit or put your towels very small area. Lifeguards were very strict with jumping etc. (For safety) but the whistle was always blowing. In all I think we stayed an hour and got bored so we left."
Relaxing day out! ,April 2019,40,Venetian Pool,jenniferjX6331ED,"Lovely outdoor pool, great for all ages, kids were in the pool the whole time playing and discovering. Very relaxing, lots of shady and sunny spots. Cafe on site provides tasty fast food and drink and reasonably priced, which makes up for the very pricey entrance fee ($65 for a family of 4, non residential) but we had a lovely relaxing time all round! "
Avoid,April 2019,10,Venetian Pool,ShaneDuffy,Of all the things to do in Miami this is bottom of the list. Go to any of the beautiful beaches which are free and have a much much better time. 
Venetian Pool,April 2019,50,Venetian Pool,PBkkk,Cave
Festival Weekend,April 2019,50,Venetian Pool,davidcA3197IF,"This is a great place to stay as well as an ideal location.

Interesting tour of historic home,February 2019,50,Deering Estate,Bob L,We had an interesting tour of a stately home and a cottage attached to it. Beautiful scenery. Our guide Jacob was very informative 
A must see,February 2019,50,Deering Estate,dotcho,"Accessible by ""free"" car park and also the ""free"" trolley bus - this is a view into James Deering's wish to make Vizkaya a splendid, if not garish, demonstration of his wealth.  All rooms are interesting as are the splendid gardens.  Interesting to note how his ""boat"" docking station has had to accept the rising water levels with photos of its earlier days."
Historical and Unique.,December 2018,50,Deering Estate,ifagundo,"This very Miami venue is the place to walk, see manatees, enjoy a cup of tea and basically spend an afternoon strolling. Highly recommended."
Historical Home - beautiful gardens,April 2018,50,Deering Estate,SUSANA E,I truly enjoyed coming here for the first time.  The homes are so historical - which I love - the gardens are so lovely by the water.
Why don’t we have gold fixtures?,February 2019,50,Deering Estate,marydunsmoor19,"As a child, I went there for a field trip. The Today show was actually filming while we were there. It’s a beautiful place and lovely garden.the bay side with its structure was perfection. Of course when I got home I was disappointed in the plain fixtures in our restrooms."
CUTE LITTLE AREA FOR SHOPPING,May 2017,50,Collins Park,Noelani W,"visited here to check out some stores with my boyfriend. we passed collins park and thought it was a very unique area. the stacked, colored, large stones caught our eyes, it was very beautiful. there are some local schools around the area, so during schooldays, the traffic may be hectic and you might find yourself surrounded by high school students. very cute little mom and pop shops as well big brand stores that are only located in Miami. very cool area to walk."
A nice quiet little park,July 2017,40,Collins Park,BradChoma,"This is a nice little park surrounded by shopping, condos and a museum which appears to be closed. It's fairly well lit at night, though technically ""closed"" which seemed odd, only because it actually was empty at night. Not what we expected. The large coloured stone stack/art piece at the Collins Ave end makes a good visual landmark for tourists. "
Nice,October 2017,40,Collins Park,JHE,"Calm and small park after a walk nice to sit down in the shadow, not much more to say actually bit if walking around in the sun some shade is nice and we found this one after a walk."
Beautifully manicured park,September 2017,50,Collins Park,ChristinaMCGM,"This was a permanent view from our Hotel windows.  Very serene, peaceful and most enjoyable to sit under a Palm tree in the humidity of the day"
Lovely park,September 2017,40,Collins Park,Kirstyonfood,"We sheltered from the midday sun here.  There are lots of places to sit under cover, and the view is wonderful. "
Animals well cared for,April 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,W8939ZGsuer,We visited Monkey Jungle and all of us enjoyed the day. We really appreciated how healthy all the animals were. We also loved that we were caged in their habitat instead of the monkeys being in cages. Those that were caged seemed healthy and happy. Playing and interacting with each other. We spent much of the day and stayed to watch King a second time because he was sleeping during our first exhibition. 
Great way to spend half a day,April 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,Cathy D,We went here and spent the afternoon with our teenage granddaughter and had a fantastic experience. We did the experience feeding the monkeys and it was well worth the cost. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for something different to do.
Prison for animals,April 2019,10,Monkey Jungle,safran012,"The price is very high, the guy in the cashier did not accept the discount coupon enclosed to the tourist information booklet that we got from the visitor center of homestead city. Strange. Don’t waste your time. Don’t support this kind of touristic trap."
"Dated, Dreary and Expensive",May 2019,10,Monkey Jungle,flaleotraveler,"My suggestion would be to visit the Miami Zoo (Zoo Miami) instead. It's accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, so you know there are some high professional standards for caring for and exhibiting animals in captivity. There's more to see and it's a better value, at around $19 for kids 3-12 and $23 for adults (+ tax). It's about 10 miles away from the Monkey Jungle."
A must visit for any monkey lover!,May 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,CiaoMille,"Hours after visiting, we are still debating what spider monkeys favorite food is. Is it the dried Papaya or apple? It's papaya. I was a gymnast for fifteen years and the gibbons have better moves than anything I ever competed. Mad respect."
"Hideous Building But, Hey, It's Home To Art Basel",December 2016,20,Miami Beach Convention Center,William B,The title sums it up - there is nothing compelling about this building other than the shows that may be offered there.
very nice,May 2016,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,ursulah511,for graduation ceremony it was so nice to see all the graduates who worked hard for their diplomas!!!
Huge & Cool Spaces @ Convention Center!!,May 2016,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,KButterfly17,I have been to Miami Beach Convention Center for many different shows and each time I have been satisfied with the accommodations & facilities!

Event,November 2016,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,buddhakouri, This convention center is undergoing a major expansion but it has been the best convention center and all of Miami Dade County.  
A very good place to visit,December 2016,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,BORIS S,It is one of the very best public service places in the state of Florida.
Fabulous!,March 2017,50,Lik Miami,BDFD,We stopped in based on the reviews we saw on Trip Advisor. My husband is a photographer and was very familiar with Peter's talent. The gallery is small and welcoming. One of the docents noticed our particular interest in certain photos and showed us additional prints behind closed doors that offered different lighting. Definitely worth a visit!
Go drool at Peter Lik's wonderful photography - purchase if you can afford!,December 2016,50,Lik Miami,VamosChicos,Do enjoy & don't blame me if you come out with a lighter wallet!
Stunning gallery,March 2017,50,Lik Miami,AJMUK,"Inspiring images, truly breathtaking pictures by Peter Lik that take your breath away...you will want to purchase everything! "

VG,December 2015,40,8th Street Designer District,BigoBoca,I've seen this neighborhood rise from the ashes. It's lost some of its original charm but has some really fine shopping and dining. 
The Modren area,November 2016,40,8th Street Designer District,mmikko,Worth to see. Nice art galleries and restaurants. Interesting architecture. A Huge contrast to some another parts of Miami nearby
Art Deco,January 2017,40,8th Street Designer District,TMK901,"8th street is a bit different from the rest of South beach. There are new and old buildings in the typical art deco style, fresh clothing stores, casual hotels, a beach and New Cafe. A street to visit when on Miami Beach. "
Great Architecture,January 2017,50,8th Street Designer District,buddhakouri,The Designer District is Miami Beach's design District of South Beach. It has stunning architecture and great designs. 
Great for children,May 2019,40,Miami Children's Museum,wwhiteiv,This museum has a lot of exhibits for kids to interact with. There also seemed to be a lot of different activities going on throughout the day. The exhibits are mostly tied to the local area making it fun for kids to learn about life in South Florida.
Very educational,July 2018,40,Miami Children's Museum,kblitz83,Kids will learn a lot from a single visit to this museum. The tour guides are very patient with kids.

"Fun, Fun, Fun for the Kids and adults",August 2018,50,Miami Children's Museum,MM1127,"It's a great place to take children between the years of 4-9, lots to explore and experiment, including the Fireman's room, my grandson didn't want to leave!"
Stimulating exhibitions of contemporary art,March 2019,50,The Bass,Ian C,We really enjoyed our visit here with art to make you think! 
Small But Mighty!,February 2019,50,The Bass,MBQ,"This is a small museum, easily visited in an hour or so.  But I'm always amazed by its quality!   I'm captivated by the exhibits year after year.  Especially the artists that combine incredible skill with humor and whimsy.  What a treat!"
Being renovated what is left is not worth the half price,March 2019,20,The Bass,tturner789,"When we entered, the front desk told us that the upper floor was being renovated and only the bottom floor was available, so the admission would be just half price.  Don't waste you time.  The exhibits were a disappointment and took about 10 minutes to view appropriately/  The only art I could understand and agree with was a frame with the torn corner of a newspaper that said ""I don't get it"".  .  "
Wonderful shows this February,February 2019,50,The Bass,CSSnowshoer,I expected a stodgy old collection so was quite pleased to find room after room of very contemporary art. We ended up spending several hours visiting all shows. Seems like this museum has some good curators so will come again. 
Fascinating exhibitions,February 2019,50,The Bass,grum99,The staff here were the friendliest I have ever met in a museum. Really interesting exhibitions - we saw three - all included in ticket and a nice cafe . Interesting people watching as well
Relaxing!!!,April 2019,50,Bayfront Park,G3000CRnancym,Sitting in the shade in the park was one of the best parts of our day.  Very relaxing and fun to people watch.  The breeze was a welcome bonus!!!
So nice that they preserved this land in a public park!,July 2019,50,Bayfront Park,LWRFL,"Right in the middle of all these high rises - and it's a large, public park on the water!  Some great forward thinking and planning many years ago.  And if you get hungry there's plenty of restaurants in the open air mall adjacent!"
Beautiful and relaxing,August 2019,40,Bayfront Park,A3650YYjulieg,This park has some nice areas to relax and also has grassy areas for play.  It is nice to walk around next to the water.
If you are in the area but not worth the detour,August 2019,40,Bayfront Park,NancyLope,Bayfront Park is not far from Bayside Marketplace.  A nice park you can come to on a sunny day.  It has large sidewalks to take a nice walk by the water.   There are a number of restaurants and shops with live music in the amphitheatre on some nights.   You may encounter some homeless people sleeping on the benches.
Great little park,August 2019,50,Bayfront Park,TheMekon,"Suitable for young kids, clean and simple to supervise. Recommended for up to ten years old we reckon. "
Love the architecture,January 2019,40,Soundscape Park,Wombling_Free_7548,This is a beautifully landscaped park with  attractive flower sculptures. We were impressed with the scale and vision.
Pass by on Your Way to the Botanical Gardens,February 2019,40,Soundscape Park,AEP77,Catch some shade and enjoy the sculptures that also help guide the plant growth!  This park is also in between the Miami Beach Botanical Gardens and the South Beach/ Lincoln Road area so if you walk you can enjoy this park and the gardens...
Unexpected,August 2018,40,Soundscape Park,regulartraveller01,We saw this on our first day - we had walked for miles and were glad of the shade. It has some great sculptures that they trained the climbing plants against. Worth stopping by.
A Soothing and Beautiful Oasis,February 2019,40,Soundscape Park,TheExplorerFamily,Worth at least one visit.
sail away,March 2019,40,Soundscape Park,juliak857,This is an amazing landscaped area to enjoy and marvel at the lush growth of beautiful greenery and abundance of flowers. Great for pics.
Somewaht anticlimactic,August 2019,30,Calle Ocho,Swodog94,"We enjoyed our visit to the famed Calle Ocho in Little Havana, but it was nothing spectacular. Perhaps next time we'll do more research and pick out some specific places we want to eat."
Nice,September 2019,50,Calle Ocho,SharanSharan,You can learn salsa for free. very welcoming place in Miami
Fun little walk on a Sunday,September 2019,50,Calle Ocho,Spapps,"We stopped by here on a Sunday after a morning at the beach. Grabbed some lunch and walked around taking in the atmosphere. Shops are quintessentially NOT MIAMI, in that the Havana influence is huge! A quaint domino park where older patrons would while away the hours (and probably the $$) playing dominoes and we ended up getting ice cream at the famous Azucar Ice cream place. Lots of street art to peruse and generally a fun place to just chill out. Don't forget to check out the 'World most famous Mojito' at La Esquina de la Fama, with the Dry ice trick to keep things fizzy!"
Good ,September 2019,40,Calle Ocho,301AlejandroA,I went with my wife last Friday  for lunch at mojito restaurant calle sw 8 streets   and we order  the big parrillada bring pork chicken  well everything  but it were not happy hour so we order to large of cuban mojito drink with coban coffee  and catalana desert  then I ask the waitress about the show  they had mostly  on Wednesday nite she told its cost 50 dollars  per person just only to see a comedian  show  I told my wife it incredible not even including  a complimentary  a drink to see the show's  I will not even to spend one single cent to see four clown on a stage that made u laugh  at all  the show maybe  will last one hour maybe but really  piss  me up is the 50 dollars  per person  charge  its outrage they want to RIP off  ur money  I guest  i will not going back no more 
Calle Ocho Day or Night!,September 2019,50,Calle Ocho,Brad B,"Miami is Latin and could be nicknamed the ""Capital of Latin America!"" Calle Ocho and Little Havana are ground zero for la cultura, la comida and la musica! The culture food, music and dance are fantastic if you want to have a Latin experience while you're in Miami! It is similar day and night, but obviously more adult oriented in the evenings. Go and experience the different bars and food offerings, dance salsa, bachata, and meringue most all night! It's great fun and not to be missed. "
Waste of time,August 2016,10,Fifth & Alton,richardX1973QM,Only about five shops and you have to go through a multi storey car par to access shops above street level.
Nice little mall,October 2016,50,Fifth & Alton,mario v,"it's a nice little mall in the heart of south beach. The publix is big and inexpensive. the petco sells betta fishes and food for a lot of animals. Best buy is a little expensive and the ross which is in the top floor is amazing. Ross sells variety of clothes from different brand for a good price, the lines get way longer than the ross in downtown but you still find pretty much everything"
Love the TJMAxx in this little mall,October 2016,50,Fifth & Alton,FLGreekGirl,And this one doesn't disappoint! Found some great deals and the staff was super friendly....
Not so impressed,January 2017,30,Fifth & Alton,aellituv,Ashame it never had the bourbon I wanted.
Beautiful Stadium,October 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Sunsnowfamily,"Bring a clear purse to get through security. Section 223 is at the club level, which is really nice but is in the sun for a 3:30 game and gets really hot, so wear your sunscreen!"
Great Stadium,October 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Michael H,"Saw the Hurricanes on 10/5/19.  Stadium was clean, new, safe, easy to get in and out of and we never stood in line more than 5 min for anything we needed.  West side tailgate scene was great.  It's just a really nice stadium.  Wish the score line was different, but had a great time."
Ride sharing difficulties = many drunk drivers,October 2019,20,Hard Rock Stadium,Kate F,"Although the stadium is quite modern and full of amenities, the management of Hard Rock Stadium did a huge disservice to it’s patrons by making ride-sharing services a pain in the neck (or rather feet) to partake in. To take an Uber or Lyft, one must walk blocks to a local elementary school. In the meantime, the taxis are located at the SE gate and attempt to cheat passengers with “flat fares”, cash only, and unwillingness to use their meters. Expect to encounter plenty of drunk drivers with the parameters put in place."
Best stadium in Collegiate and Professional Athletics,October 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,jpnugent1995,"Ok, maybe I am a bit biased as I am a die hard Miami Hurricanes and Miami Dolphins fan but this stadium is incredible. From the beauty of it when you first see it appear in the distance to the amenities when you're cheering your team on it's hard to beat. Easily the best food and drink options out of any stadium (though very expensive) and the covered seating is clutch in the brutal South Florida heat. 4 giant big screens around the stadium make missing the action darn near impossible. With new walkways, bridges and tunnels for fans its safer than ever and plenty of merchandise and interactive zones make this the best game day experience."
Neighborhood bookstore with nice cafe,March 2018,50,Village of Merrick Park,Gablesgirls,"Whether you visit to purchase a book or have a snack while enjoying the garden seating, B&B will not disappoint."
Ritsy & Glitzy,December 2018,20,Village of Merrick Park,OGSarahMarie,"No chain stores in site. 2-story, Outside mall with spacious terrace in Coral Gables. Parking is a nightmare! Plus, you pay for every 30mins and it’s not cheap. The stores are high luxuary and not family friendly. Associates in stores seem to have their nose stuck up in the air of your not walking in with a Gucci, Coach or Prada bag."
Very nice,December 2018,50,Village of Merrick Park,mayramolina56,"It is a very nice place. I love it. This place is a beautiful place. You can visit the stores, eat and have a good time in this place."
So Nice,September 2018,40,Village of Merrick Park,edgarbb1981,"Second time here, it’s very nice, the whole place is organized, pretty and classy. You will fell tented to shop here, and if you have the bucks, you should as it’s definitely a great place to shop. You can also have a walk and enjoy the surrounding which is fantastic."
Nice open shopping mall,January 2019,50,Village of Merrick Park,Gwenn M,This mall is small by mega mall standards and has some high end shops. It has nice landscaping and several outdoor restaurants. 
Marvellous !!!,May 2017,40,New World Symphony,Breno L,"Wonderfull and functional building.Perfect acustic, good theaters and very simpathetic way of showing outside what is going inside by projection"
Worth a trip by all meansn,December 2017,50,New World Symphony,984leev,Frank Gehry designed this auditorium built in 2011 and it is an architectural masterpiece! If you have the time go to one of the many concerts and marvel at the auditorium's arena and its hydrolic wonders. 
Tour this Gehry building.,February 2018,50,New World Symphony,mrsagf,And hear a concert--buy tickets in advance. The intimate hall only seats 750. Amazing musicianship in wonderful acoustics.
Go On The Free Days,December 2017,50,New World Symphony,kudzu,"Beautiful [just for the architecture] - have many freebees, i.e., youth concerts; pre-concert talks, etc."
Awesome!,September 2018,50,New World Symphony,Pineapples-a-Plenty,Their outdoor space is just as incredible as indoors. Can’t wait to go back!
Architectural wonder ,July 2019,40,Venetian Pool,stewcavan60,"The pool was very clean, not too crowded despite the heatwave. It is a serious architectural  wonder how they built this pool. Highly recommend to visit, you will have a great time."
Truly unique,August 2019,40,Venetian Pool,Isabelle L,"This is a truly unique natural pool located in a nice and quiet residential area. Parking is limited with a few places next to the entrance a several more in a separate parking in a diagonal from the entrance. No fee for parking. Arrive early to be sure to have parking. Admission is 20$ u.s. per person aged 13 and up which is really very pricey. To be sure that you will get your money’s worth, verify on line the water temperature on that day, not everyone is willing to swim in 72 degrees water, so before you pay this much money take the time to verify. While you are in the area, take the time to go for a little drive, Coral Gables is really very nice."
Great atmosphere in truly refreshing waters ,August 2019,50,Venetian Pool,Enjoy-a-blessed-life,"You feel - well, rejuvenated after having taken some strokes in this pool’s pristine water. Let’s put it that way: If I could think of 5 pools worth the air travel I’d think of Blue Lagoon, Iceland; Bad Fischau, Austria; Tabacon, Costa Rica; this one; and: the fifth one I’ll still need to discover. There is a basic cafe, don’t expect anything even close to fancy, however they’ll fix a Hot Dog, burger, or curly fries. And maybe that’s all you need for a successful afternoon between limestone, corals, and palm trees. We truly enjoyed 3 hours at this marvel!"
Worth at least one visit,September 2019,40,Venetian Pool,tiffanyo2,I loved the history and the room that showed all the old photos. 
Beautiful house and gardins,December 2018,50,Deering Estate,Art P,One of my favorite places and haunts for bike riders to meet on the weekend. Beautiful gardins to walk about. Well kept. Regular activities on the calendar 
Great Pool Visit,September 2019,40,Venetian Pool,camrafan,I felt the entrance fee was quite expensive considering locker rental is also $5 per locker (which are not very spacious) but overall well worth a visit. 
Miami History And Music Venue,March 2019,40,Deering Estate,classact007B,Don't miss going through the house.
Great history!,December 2018,50,Deering Estate,305EnidM,"Nice to go during the Christmas holiday season. They do a beautiful job of decorating the estate, play outdoor movies for the kids and have different food items available."
Beautiful way to spend an afternoon,June 2019,50,Deering Estate,michael c,"NOTE, become a family member which comes with all kinds of free events; their members only cocktail party which is free is awesome, "
Lousy experience no refund,June 2019,10,Deering Estate,Judy S,Showed up 10 minutes prior to opening. Waited for 20 minutes and no employee. Meanwhile eaten up by mosquitos. No tour times posted. Returned half hour later with bug spray. Bought a ticket and attendant never told me tour had already left and next one wasn’t for two hours. It’s very hot and humid and I couldn’t wait in the heat so I requested a refund. Nothing so I left. Poor poor service.
Sculpture,February 2018,40,Collins Park,LollysLook,We took a walk around the area and stopped here to look at some of the sculptures and art in the park.
Not worth the detour,February 2018,30,Collins Park,alwparisicfg,Quite disappointed but what did I expect ? No charm what else : do not go there if you have nothing to do there!
Well hidden but beautiful park,March 2018,50,Collins Park,Bazza57,"A wonderful peaceful haven. Walk alongside the marina to the beach, watch out for dolphins.  Stop for a drink at Smith & Wollensky.  Not to be missed on a trip to South Beach, Miami."
Good park,April 2018,50,Collins Park,Luba and Simon P,"Good park, great location, a lot of trees and shadow places . I would enjoy it if I had enough time. Not many opportunities for good  entertainment    "
Collins Park,April 2018,40,Collins Park,nwaynesworld,Nice park. We spent a few hours walking here. Easy access to the ocean. This is also a good place for cyclists. 
Relaxing,June 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,BGoudieSOMI,I really enjoyed my visit here with my family. Aside from the interaction with the monkeys and birds (which was great) I enjoyed the tranquility of walking the beautiful grounds. Even driving around in the rural farm area is a nice break from the hustle of Miami.
Private Tour,June 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,djanchondo,"The staff at Monkey Jungle was courteous and honest with my wife and I the day we showed up. Storms were in the area and they offer a rain check for instances such as these. Luckily for us, everything worked out just fine! Bailey was our guide and she provided us (and the monkeys) with a positive experience! She was very knowledgeable about the monkeys and their behaviors/individuality. During the tour the monkeys surround you and you basically get lost in the experience. You also get the feel of being in an actual rain forest with the trees you're surrounded by. Bailey didn't spend time interfering with our interactions, but rather let us take it all in and enjoy it while answering any questions we had and enhancing the experience for us. The tour takes about 45 minutes and with a small group (ours was 4 people) the food lasted every minute of the experience so we were never short on interactions! 10/10 times I would spend the money on this tour. There's very few things I like to do again, but this is at the top of my list to do when we make it back to Florida."
Excellent!,June 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,NotYourBroom,"We typically don't visit zoos but this place seems different.  They have huge areas for the monkeys and a lot of monkey. The Macaques area has 150 monkeys in 7 acres.  Because of the set up, monkeys are able to form social structures, hunt for food, and live very much like they would in the wild.  They have three main areas - the Macaques, the squirrel monkeys, and the gorilla.  There are also a few other animals in smaller cages.  There are three ""shows"" that allow you to see and learn about the animals and also you can walk around and feed the monkeys raisins.  There is a small snack bar that has very limited selections but there is pizza so if you are there at lunch time you don't have to worry about food.  I highly recommend this place especially with young kids."
Worth the drive,July 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,stefaniech24,"Although it’s about an hour from Miami, it’s worth the drive. The education about the animals in the park is great and it was fun to feed the monkeys. Our infant daughter loved it too!"
Dream Come True for Monkey Lovers ,July 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,RVA_Explor3r,"So keep that in mind when going, but I’m telling you it is worth 100% every penny to do the jungle tour with the monkey encounters! Give these guys support for an awesome environment they are creating for these primates. "
Still a construction site:(,October 2017,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,Boris P,Apparently it is going to be quite good after all of the construction work is done. Right now it is not a prime location to visit in SoBe. The hurricane did’t help at all. Don’t bother.
Great events ,November 2017,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,439hassaned,Always hosting great events they know how that is important to bring business to Miami Beach and to miami. 
under Construction for a long time,January 2017,30,Miami Beach Convention Center,Elaano,unfortunately the convention Center is still not ready. They have a big delay and I think this does influence the Traffic in Miami Beach. Hoping it will be done soon and we can enjoy great things coming.
Don't bring your car!!!,April 2018,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,UNPREDICTABLE1,"Definitely the Convention Center has undergone a major improvement and it is 4 times bigger than before.  Truly it is very nice and attractive architecturally, even though the Convention Center Drive portion is still under construction.  The MAJOR CON is PARKING.  We went for the Home Show and if you are not somewhat familiar with Miami Beach then parking will cost you an arm and a leg.  The best place to park is in one of the parking garages and they fill quickly, but the one on 17th on Convention Center Drive is your cheapest bet. ($4 for a few hours)  Some parking places were charging $30 to park and finding street parking is like winning the lottery.  Hopefully under ALL THAT CONSTRUCTION they will unveil a parking garage."
NEW AND INCREDIBLE!!,August 2018,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,traveltrackers,The above photo doesn't exist any longer. See the WAVE!! Huge and great for conventions and shows. Near Lincoln Road and theatre of the performing arts
Wow. ,March 2018,50,Lik Miami,jessicapG1242PS,"Blown away by the artistic talent. The staff were clearly into their job, and loved the work. Wish I could afford to take one of the big ones home!!!"
Art Studio,February 2018,40,Lik Miami,LollysLook,Lik Miami on Lincoln Road is an amazing Art gallery with very talented pieces. We enjoyed touring the studio.
Beautiful Photos in a Beautiful Gallery,April 2018,50,Lik Miami,ckkeane411,My wife and I stopped in just to check out the artwork and we fell in love with so many of the images in this gallery. We ended up purchasing a piece and the design and styles offered are luxurious but reasonable (price range is around $4-$6K for newer pieces and $8-10K for the older pieces that have less available of that print). We can't wait for the piece to be delivered and we will definitely be back in the future.
great gallery,May 2017,50,Lik Miami,andrewharbor1,"great staff, gallery, product. Perfect delivery for this type of facility and industry. great private rooms for full viewings before pulling the trigger. "
Amazing photos,May 2018,50,Lik Miami,77leelee,I love visiting when in Miami or Vegas. Absolutely love the photography. Some pictures really bring out emotions due to the way the light is captured.  The studio is a bit small but plenty of pictures to view. Definitely worth stopping in.
A beautiful area along Ocean Blvd directly accross from the water.,December 2017,40,8th Street Designer District,Allen B,"The old buildings consisting of art deco hotels and little restaurants/clubs is so cool to admire and visit any time but we especially like it in the evening after 8:00 when things start to get a little more lively.  Grab a seat at one of the restaurants and have a drink, listen to music and people watch."
A lively area to walk and enjoy,January 2018,40,8th Street Designer District,923naderh,This area is very new but has turned into a very nice gathering place. Not many restaurants are active yet.
Not yet distinctive.,February 2018,30,8th Street Designer District,mrsagf,"It is possible that the ""8th Street Designer District"" is too new a designation for a distinctive enclave to have emerged yet."
Nice walk,February 2018,40,8th Street Designer District,LollysLook,This area is a pretty walk with Art Deco buildings and shopping. We would walk the strip along the waterfront before sunset and admire the buildings.
Retreat ,April 2018,50,8th Street Designer District,annmarieaskew,"OMG I thought I had died and went to heaven with all of my favorite designers: Louis Vuitton, Tom Ford, Giuseppe, Givenchy, Versace, Chloe, etc. if you don’t have any self control, don’t go "
A lot of fun,October 2019,50,Miami Children's Museum,Chris5926,"The kids had a lot of fun! There is so much to do and the kids can be very creative. We went on a Sunday, right when they opened and it was not busy until a few hours later. Kids were able to try out everything without having to wait. Great place."
Fun time for children,October 2019,50,Miami Children's Museum,ElsieN99,This is a great museum for young children and families.  There are regular exibits that the whole family can enjoy and changing exhibits that add to the surprise.  Lots of fun things to do in the area for the whole family
"Overpriced, poorly maintained facility",November 2019,20,Miami Children's Museum,Stephmlb,Decided to spend a rainy day at the children’s museum. A lot of the exhibits were broken or not accessible to children. Seemed quite run down and dirty. The only place for food was Subway and the staff there were incredibly rude to us and other customers. We left with the thought we would never be returning to this museum.
Fantastic,November 2019,50,Miami Children's Museum,Agingwell711,Went with my 3 year old granddaughter.  It was completely interactive!  We stayed 4 hours and probably could have stayed longer.  Be sure to get an activity schedule when you come in.  Military discount is half price!  There is a Subway on site.  The only drawback was parking for which you must pay although it is not expensive.
Great time with a toddler,December 2019,50,Miami Children's Museum,frand776,"On a day too cool for the beach, during a 4-day visit to see my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter in Miami, my daughter and I took advantage of “mini Monday” at the children’s museum. It was our first visit and we were thrilled with the exhibits. There was so much for a very busy toddler to do! From the fishing boat to the art and music games to the model supermarket to the building and construction unit, we were all kept engaged for hours. There is a Subway restaurant for lunch. The souvenir shop was also a big hit with the baby who loves poring over books as my daughter read to her. The next day the baby asked to return to the museum."
Limited galleries open when i visited,October 2019,40,The Bass,Carol L,great staff and what I did see was enjoyable. Free admission since not fully open/.Easy to get to on free trolley. Nice grassy area  with benches surrounding the museum.
"It isn't bad, but if you don't visit it you aren't missing anything.",September 2019,20,The Bass,JosePenaA8201,Duration: 30 minutes.
It was a free Bank of America weekend,November 2019,30,The Bass,GailGermany,"The Bass is a smaller modern art museum at the end of Collins Park. Having a BOA credit card enabled me to get in for free. You really have to like very modern, abstract art to fully appreciate this museum."
In the Cone of Uncertainty,November 2019,50,The Bass,B4582OVrobinw,Very stimulating display of contemporary art from Haegue Yang in the wonderful setting of the Bass Art Museum.  It's only on until 5 April 2020 so go while you can.
Skip it,December 2019,10,The Bass,crackcritic,This is the type of museum you get when rich people don’t know what to do with their money.  Be sure not to miss the toilet paper holders and the group of construction poles.
Multi-activity park.,October 2019,40,Bayfront Park,Sayeedac1,"A park with lots of activities and people milling around doing their stuff. There is an amphitheater, Tina Hills auditorium, where a yoga practice was going on. Understand a big bash is held on the 4th of July and the New Year's eve. There is also a figure of the Mother of Miami's in one corner. It's also close to the Marketplace where shops & restaurants are aplenty. Hotel Intercontinental is nearby. Lots of benches where one can sit and see ecarts being driven around. All in all, a relaxing, enjoyable place to spend some time."
Nice place to have a walk.,October 2019,50,Bayfront Park,Martin F,Between Bayfront Market and the Intercontinental Hotel. Ver well kept gardens. A lot of palm trees. Great for children.
Love this venue,October 2019,50,Bayfront Park,Heidi D,Small and friendly and so scenic with the skyline.  We always enjoy events here and feel it's safe and well run.
Bay front ,November 2019,40,Bayfront Park,LollysLook,The Bayfront Park in Miami is a pretty patk on the water. It’s currently being decorated for the holiday season. The Christmas tree lighting is this weekend with a Christmas village. 
Nice park,November 2019,40,Bayfront Park,R_and_K_G,This is a nice park to walk through en route to the bayside area. It’s at the front is you can also look at the nice yachts!
Meticulously landscaped ,July 2019,50,Soundscape Park,stewcavan60,"We were lucky to visit this park during the blooming seasons, beautiful and tall flowers everywhere you look. It's fascinating! "
Soundscape Park-Bougainvilleas & morning shade,August 2019,50,Soundscape Park,ATLpch,"A short walk from Lincoln Rd, we found Soundscape Park on our way back from the Sunday morning farmer’s market.  The sun was already hot, but we found some shade strolling under the bougainvilleas,  and we took a video of a flock of exotic birds preening on the grass nearby.  It was a nice experience on our walk back to our hotel.  Great quiet spot in the middle of busy South Beach!"
Pretty little nook,August 2019,50,Soundscape Park,11DubsL,A nice cool down spot if you need it!
Soundscape Park,October 2019,30,Soundscape Park,387indy,"Soundscape Park downtown, street parking, facilities, some bench seating. Some pigeons and birds in park. Restaurants and things to do in area."
Beautiful Open Air Musical Venue,October 2019,50,Soundscape Park,TheDealBeans,"Soundscape is a lovely park area to walk, sit and enjoy. Lot's of people walking through and just relaxing. We were there on a Saturdau morning when they were trialling the sound system for the evenings classical concert. The speakers are situated in a series of grey pipework around the park. It was a lovely experience to be in the park with this classical music playing (fairly loud!). A great experience. Even without he music the park is well kept and nice to be in."
Good for a relaxed afternoon,April 2019,40,Calle Ocho,kathybI8864PP,"We enjoy browsing in the shops, dining on traditional Cuban food, and drinking Mojitos and Cuban coffee.  Calle Ocho is super casual, but remains one of our favorite ways to spend an afternoon while in Miami."
8th street,November 2019,30,Calle Ocho,sndovale,It's just the name of the street where Little Havana is located. To us it was mostly a place for tourists to spend time and money.
Little Havana ,November 2019,40,Calle Ocho,LollysLook,"Calle Ocho is street in little Havana.  It’s the the hub of the area with Shops, restaurants  and the star walk with legendary Cubans having a star on the sidewalk "
Cute place!,November 2019,40,Calle Ocho,Alice B,"Calle Ocho is definitely worth a visit! Lots of bars and restaurants playing Cuban music, men playing dominoes, it’s very Cuba and lots of fun!"
"lively, fun, people watching",February 2019,40,Calle Ocho,devilonmyback,"We came to Little Havana after a day of sightseeing.  We parked, got out and walked up and down the avenue taking it all in, going from store to store, reading menus deciding where to dine.  Great energy and people watching, love the whole scene."
Ez-Breezy,November 2019,50,Port of Miami,PassaporteFamilia, Finding our ride was easy outside as many hold up signs and once spotted they can come pick you up from the Loading area.
Worst experience for debarkation ever.,December 2019,10,Port of Miami,Royalpain19,Getting off the Royal Caribbean's Oasis was a complete nightmare. No signs. Employees telling us to go to opposite sides for buses. Took away the relaxation from the cruise. I'm writing this while waiting 2 hours for the bus.
Busy,November 2019,40,Port of Miami,rschagrin,All the cruise lines have built their own terminals.
Good experience turned bad,December 2019,30,Port of Miami,877aliciat,"The facility is absolutely beautiful and the staff were very professional and kept everyone in order. It was a very fast and professional experience. Unfortunately, during our return...my fiance and I were separated because I had a passport and he had a birth certificate. Once he got in the line, which consisted of 20 people...the employee stopped the line and when the people asked why she said because the people who had passports were more important/priority than the people standing in line to verify their birth certificates. Mind you her job was to handle just the people who had birth certificates. I wish I would have witnessed this because I would have got her name off her badge. My fiance said a lot of the people in line were very angry and couldn't believe an unprofessional comment came out of her mouth. We only had that one issue on our disembarkment. "
Best port experience I have had in 20 years of cruising!,December 2019,50,Port of Miami,LORENZO9321,"We had the opportunity to board a Royal Caribbean ship, the oasis of the seas through Dock A at the Miami port.The new docking area is beautiful, they airlines could learn a lesson from the efficiency done through the security check. We pretty much just walked right on the ship there was no waiting and hordes of people in line which is typical of boarding a large crew ship."
Publix 5th & Alton,December 2018,50,Fifth & Alton,jvil2018,"Overall great experience. Usually find everything I need, but based on South Beach location, prices are a bit higher. Staff is super friendly."
Not really worth the walk but some good shops here,July 2019,50,Fifth & Alton,TERRAvelista,"Conclusion: even if you like walking a lot, in summer time only travel via your car"
"Publix, TJ Maxx, Ross, Best Buy",August 2019,50,Fifth & Alton,139nathaliep,We were looking for Best Buy and TJ Maxx and this small building encompassing Publix on top was perfect. Good bargains. 2-hour parking for free. What else ?
Cheap Shopping,October 2019,30,Fifth & Alton,TheDealBeans,"A large TJ Maxx, Ross and a big pet store. Lot's of cheap shopping if you like a 'Rummage Around'. I wouldn't drive here specially, but we were passing while walking around the area so we dropped in.There is a large multi-storey cark park loated within the building."
The Good and The Bad,November 2019,30,Hard Rock Stadium,louisf777,Overall it was a decent experience but they could make some improvements.
Dolphins v Jets football game,November 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,radiogurl,"So,warning to future attendees, keep your necessary item either in your pockets or in a tiny pouch or else it will be taken from you."
Impressive,November 2019,40,Hard Rock Stadium,norskies,"Having never been to a major football stadium, we wanted to have a look at this one.  It was impressive from the outside, but otherwise they don't let you see much.  We did find a place we could drive in, but were given strict instructions that we could only go to the team store.  It would be nice if they had a place you could see more without having to buy something."
Dolphins need to control fans,December 2019,20,Hard Rock Stadium,Anne L,I went to the Miami Dolphins Game vs. Philadelphia Eagles game at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. We had 10 seats in section 129. Paid about $200.00 per seat. The family came in from Philadelphia for the game so we decided to get good seats. Fans in front of us standing up and holding signs the entire game. Ended up watching the game on the jumbo screens vs the players on the screen......next time will stay home!
Great day out,December 2019,50,Hard Rock Stadium,Michael T,Visited on day the Eagles were in town. Great atmosphere in the stadium and a fantastic game. The whole place is geared to giving you a fantastic day out and plenty to eat and drink. Had a fantastic day.
Parking Garage Debacle,May 2019,10,Village of Merrick Park,thriftytraveler23,"As a frequent visitor of Merrick Mall and Landmark Theatre, I was completely uphauled at the behavior of parking attendants and staff. We had finished watching a movie at the theatre and had payed for the parking and went to our car. We stayed in the car for 12 mins. As we headed out, at the Le Jeune #201 exit, the parking structure would not let us out and told us to pay an additional 3 dollars. We called the parking attendant who repeated to tell us that we had overstayed after paying and that once paying you must leave. We asked to have an attendant sent down, which did not happen. After calling once again, the attendant would not answer my question as to how much time we had to leave. She said between 10-15, I then proceeded to ask whether 13 mins was not in fact in between 10 and 15. She then changed her tune to tell us that we had 10 mins to leave and must pay for the additional 2 hours if we intended to leave. This is incompetence should not be tolerated and tourists and residents be aware that they are trying to take your money. So if you watch a movie at Merrick make sure to book it out of there before you end up spending your entire college tuition on a parking ticket. ;)))"
High End Retail,May 2019,40,Village of Merrick Park,wernolabound,A good selection of high end retail shops anchored by Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. Shady three story mall is not air conditioned and is exposed to the outside. Shops are comfortably air conditioned. Good selection of restaurants as well.
Carnival Victory Cruise,October 2019,50,Port of Miami,TresaCrouch,19 of us was in the group and no one had any complaints.
Large cruise port with easy access but congestions ,November 2019,40,Port of Miami,Voyage_familial,This also avoid metered taxi charge until you have a prenegociated price. 
Futuristic Terminals Make Boarding a Breeze,October 2019,50,Port of Miami,Maria M,The new Royal Caribbean terminal is beautiful and very futuristic.  The new system of making appointments for checking in made the boarding process a breeze.  We basically went from being dropped off to on the ship in less than half an hour.  Great job!
Cruise ,November 2019,50,Port of Miami,donpF3427XU,"Easy to get in the roads and signs are awesome. Easy parking. The port has Comfortable seating and rest rooms , has Handicapped access all over with elevators and escalators to access ships in every Building. The Ships are clearly marked and easily seen. Nice and clean and safe with allot of officers around."
Confusing parking,November 2019,40,Port of Miami,tyk192018,"The signage is not great. Get there early to find where your ship is departing from. Keep in mind that you won’t necessarily be coming back to the same spot, we had to walk a significant distance. I would probably just take a taxi/Uber  next time"
"Not your typical ""mall"" experience..and not for the better either",June 2019,30,Village of Merrick Park,sabinodice,"Super high end shops that if you don't have the money is really not worth the stroll around the mall.  Street parking is hard to find or non existent, and if you do luck out the hourly rates are outrageous.  Most (not all) visitors and even the people that work in the shops are a bit pretentious and outright snooty (tried using a more common folk word instead of arrogant, conceited or haughty).  Restaurants are also extremely expensive and the amount of food you get isn't worth the price.  The mall is outdoors (except the actual stores of course) so if you are there for the summer it'll be an real scorcher, which of course you'll be looked down on if you try to go into a store to cool off without buying anything.  Try the dolphin mall or even dadeland if you are looking for a better experience, indoor mall with reasonably priced stores and plenty of affordable food options."
Another open mall,July 2019,40,Village of Merrick Park,Luckydog17,I don’t need to come back but the free shuttle is very convenient!
Merrick Park Shopping experience,August 2019,50,Village of Merrick Park,Julio D,"Try  the Nordstrom Café, nice place to enjoy a great food while shopping."
Fantastic musical experience,March 2019,50,New World Symphony,mark14102015,A night to remember!!!
A temple of sound,February 2019,50,New World Symphony,Barbara K I,"We went to see the St. Olaf choir (don't ask, my partner is Norwegian) and the music was fine, but the venue is impressive. Very beautiful, not too big, and the sound is first-class. I haven't been down to see one of the Wallcasts, but that is next on my list (listen to music for free outside the auditorium, and watch a screencast on the wall.) We drove back on Collins and A1A because it was night and that was lovely. No white knuckles like 95 can be as you approach Miami. "
Chance passing ,May 2019,40,New World Symphony,StephenCr0ss,We dropped in here as we happened to be in the amazing park in front. It’s a world class Symphony hall and ultra modern. Believe some concerts are free.
Excellent,September 2019,50,New World Symphony,BigoBoca,This Miami Beach venue is a must see. Michael Tilson Thomas has created a destination for lovers of classical music.
A night out at the symphony Wallcast is a Beach bargain!,November 2019,50,New World Symphony,pthomas156,"On a regular basis, the New World Symphony broadcasts its concerts on the big blank wall of its Frank Gehry-designed performance hall. That means that you can gather up your lawn chairs, your blanket, your picnic and your wine and settle down in the park in front of the concert hall for a free night out at the symphony. We were there with friends last night. We pulled into the parking garage behind the building ($15) about 6:45 and were spreading out our blanket by 7 pm. for the 7:30 concert. Several hundred people were already there, so I'd suggest coming a bit earlier, especially in season. I feel like we grabbed one of the last closer spaces on the right side of the screen area. The view is great; it's really entertaining to see a symphony broadcast with closeups etc rather than just watching from a seat in a hall. And the sound system outside is truly outstanding. Can't say enough about that. Although the audience is right on one of the city's busiest streets, the street noise doesn't interfere with your enjoyment, even when a Ferrari runs through its gears. Most people were sitting in normal-size lawn chairs (as opposed to shorter sand chairs). It was a congenial crowd, bigger than I expected in drowsy November. "
Nice place!,November 2018,50,Venetian Pool,Susana M,We enjoyed going to this historical pool with the family but the water is just too cold for my taste. I would still recommend for it’s uniqueness and history. I love Coral Gables️
Venetial Magic pool,November 2019,50,Venetian Pool,70leidyg,"It worth it...I liked it a lot...that place, the views are awsome......do not rent a chair, there is a lot of places to sit around magical spots. "
Vintage Swimming experience ,November 2019,50,Venetian Pool,Angela225,"Practical details - $15 dollars admission, $5 dollars for locker plus $5 dollars deposit, $10 dollars to rent lounger, and towels can be bought for $8. Posting thus because it was quite difficult to find the info. Great way to spend a morning - you need to be able to swim, not really for lounging as such, no infants . But wonderful old pool"
Relaxing Pool Day,November 2019,50,Venetian Pool,christinarick,"My friends and I went to the Venetian Pool for the afternoon in early November. The pool was beautiful! There is a small waterfall, and the architecture of the area is really pretty. When we were there, it wasn't busy at all, and it was peaceful. We were worried about loud children running around, but it was calm, and there were very few families there. I'd go back again!"
In & Out,February 2019,50,Port of Miami,suzanne c,Have Used Several Times. Organized- Easy To Catch Uber or Taxi Drop Off Right In Front Of Terminals. 
Amazing Skyline,August 2019,40,Port of Miami,tresmelange,"I had to go to the Port of Miami to take a day trip from the city to Bimini Bay (Bahamas). The area was easy to navigate and once you're on the boat, you have a great skyline view of the city!"
Dishonest Shuttle Service,September 2019,10,Port of Miami,eleexds5,"Beware of the Shuttle that takes you from the Cruise Terminals to Fort Lauderdale.  The one company called Metro Shuttle Service with phone number (954) 600-1562 attached to the side doors. If you ask of they take Credit Cards, they will say yes but the driver will say no. Then he holds your baggage hostage. We had to call the number an give our info over the phone. And he overcharged me. Charged everyone else $30 for two people, but charged us $40 after he agreed to charge only $30. I called him an he said he will take care of, just send him the info on a text. I did what he asked but he still let the transaction go through. So now I really can't trust them. Oh and the driver started assaulting people that were trying to get their bags. This is a shady company. They will rip you off."
Great Cruise Port,September 2019,50,Port of Miami,GeorgeW1354,"I've grown to like cruising out of Miami.  Beautiful new terminals being completed.  RCI is done and great. Norwegian is under construction.  Two ways to get there, the tunnel or the bridge.  Once all of the construction is done it will be even better.  No entry security check like you have to endure in Fort Lauderdale.  Cabs are plentiful and well organized by the staff."
Fast Embartment,October 2019,40,Port of Miami,478camen,This was one of the smoother trips to Port of Miami - Shuttle service got us to the port quickly dropping us off at our ship and the Carnival line wait time to get on the ship was less than 40 minutes so no complaints there.   The port in general was not very crowded when we arrived but shortly after we got inside the terminal there was a much  longer line so glad we left when we did
Bring your own supplies...,November 2019,40,Venetian Pool,Whitney S,"A bit of a mixed experience here. This is a truly unique place and you should definitely check it out. I can't believe they allow you to go in the caves and bask on the rock formations - it's so cool. It's fresh water and is cool, clean, and refreshing. On the other hand, they have a nickle-and-dime kind of business model, which I'm not crazy about. Definitely bring your own towel - they will not have towels available unless you choose to purchase one for $8. They also make you pay to rent lounge chairs, which just feels a step too far. You certainly can get by without doing so, but it's not the comfy poolside experience that would be common at a hotel, for example. There is a cafe on site, that we did not try. I also think we had a nice time in part because we came on an off day when it was a little cooler, so it wasn't crowded."
Deering Estate,September 2019,50,Deering Estate,387indy,"The grounds are 420 acres of beautiful park in southwestern Miami. Charles Deering was from Chicago. The land was once were ancient Tequesta Indians buried their dead. In 1920, Deering had a three story Mediterranean House built, he died there in 1927. The land includes the older two story Richmond Cottage built in 1896 ( one of Miami's oldest structures, once an Inn). I went on Sept. 28, for a Ghost Tour, they have tours in Oct. & Nov.."
Nice 1/2 Day Trip,July 2019,30,Deering Estate,Daniel F,Friends came for visit and decided to go to Deering Estate. Was let down as I wanted to impress my friends. It is historical and needs preserving but is over rated. Wished there was more historical info in guide pamphlet. It is a nice diversion from other sites but will avoid going back.
Had a wonderful event here.  It is a must see while in Miami,November 2019,50,Deering Estate,Joel C,This is a really nice attraction and give you great insite into early Miami days.  It is must see place and worth the time. 
glorious setting for stylish events,September 2019,50,Deering Estate,charlescV1086IU,"Go when a concert is playing there. Nice acoustics ,""gemeutlich' atmosphere , meet other people you would like to know"
Gates closed,December 2019,10,Deering Estate,Jude46115,"I’m sure it is a fascinating place, but we arrived at 4:05 and the gates closed at 4pm an hour before the museum closes, leaving us out of luck! And when we tried to walk to the pier a belligerent guard was blocking the way!!! Foul mouthed and rude!!!"
Beautiful view,May 2019,50,Collins Park,Holdthebread,Wonderful spot to stop and relax. Greenery right by the water. Great spot to people watch! Beautiful spot
Little well developed park ,May 2019,40,Collins Park,StephenCr0ss,Very nice little park that is calm. Trees nicely spaced out and it’s a quite place. Well worth a visit and a few interesting items to see (photos attached). 
Still a nice place,May 2019,30,Collins Park,createparadise,"An oasis in the busy city, palm trees within green lawn places.Quiet and cool, less people than at the beach and there is shadow if you need some."
PERFECT SPOT IN SoBe,June 2019,50,Collins Park,bosox_brit66,"This is the best place in Sobe to enjoy a quiet walk with headphones ,people watch and trust me you wont know where to look on weekends or enjoy a pleasant walk during the morning."
Great for a Stroll,October 2019,40,Collins Park,TheDealBeans,"At the top end of Collins Avenue this is a lovely place to stroll or sit and watch the world go by. Beautiful setting with trees and a few sculptures, sit down, relax and chill out. Just what you need."
Barrel of fun,September 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,smcdaniel,What a neat place. Anyone that likes wildlife will love this place. Jasmine did a wonderful job w the gorilla exhibit. King is his nameand he's 50 yrs old. Lots of baby monkeys
Under construction,March 2019,20,Port of Miami,John W,We did back to back cruises.  Had hoped to be able to walk from RCL to Norwegian - a distance of about 1000 yards.  Nup.  During construction work there are no paths!  'Tram' stops well short of RCL and no way to get through other than by taxi.  So $USD20 for the miles to get from Eurostars Langford to RCL terminal and $USD15 to get the 1000 yards from RCL to Norwegian!  Might be nice when it is all finished.  Hopefully they provide paths!
They have made improvements on service,July 2019,30,Port of Miami,Cruiselover1963,Good job.
Very easy,July 2019,50,Port of Miami,earsropen,I have taken 3 cruises out of here in a year and the experience has been great.  Very easy to park and staff has been very friendly.
Cruise Boarding Carnival,August 2019,50,Port of Miami,PaulyPauly2014,"This place is a happening and a busy place! While preparing and boarding for our cruise and so forth this place was like a machine one step to another! The porters were constantly going above and beyond The call of duty, to make every step fun, easy and smooth! Miami Port! Kudos...."
Cruise,August 2019,50,Port of Miami,313SamuelA,Our family of 8 sailed to the Bahamas on Royal Caribbean international on August 4 that sailed from the port of Miami.  The process went smoothly and the signs were well marked. 
Great family trip,September 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,DCCR336,"What a great experience. It is nice to walk around to feed the monkeys in their little pails, but where the real fun is, is the rain forest adventure. Yes it is pricey, but so worth it. The look on the kid's faces when the monkeys were on their heads was priceless. As soon as you walk in the monkeys are all over you. All of us enjoyed it. Seeing the gorilla was fun too. He seems happy and well taken care of. The trainers are extremely knowledgeable and answered all the questions asked. I would highly recommend a visit to Monkey Jungle!!!"
Great Time; Rainforest Adventure Tour Totally Worth It,October 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,969nateb,"All in all, a great visit!"
So much fun!,October 2019,50,Monkey Jungle,Staschek88,"My wife and I enjoyed everything about the preservation, especially the feeding experience in the forest. Highly recommended!!"
Awful,October 2019,10,Monkey Jungle,Iwcsuu,The park is really small there is nothing intrested in it just couple of monkeys in the cages. We payed a lot for nothing. You cannot feed the monkeys just if you pay extras. I feel myself very miserable because i travelled a lot for nothing. It take 10minutes to walk around. If you read this here is my advice: dont go there!!!
Impressive Renovations,October 2018,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,buddhakouri,"I came here after the renovations have been completed to see the Miami Int. Auto Show of 2018 after being cancelled in 2017 after Hurricane Irma and the renovations. I am very impressed with the renovations at the convention center. The entrance is a two-story glass lobby that is more than four times the size as the old one. It’s now a great place to go if you want to see the Miami Home Shows, a boat show or most of all, the Miami International Auto Show. "
Recently renovated center,May 2019,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,RRaposoMiami,"Have been visiting this Miami Beach Convention Center for decades, from many Auto Shows, Home Shows to Art Basel and Graduations. Although they always have food and drinks, it's not what you go to the center for, its for the Event. Happily the new renovations finally have happened and the exterior alone makes quite a statement that this is not the same 1960s Convention Center. From the exterior to the new lobby, very modern clean and sleek looking. Now let's see how the parking area out front ends up looking. Glad to see it all finally happen."
Miami Beach Convention Center,July 2019,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,387indy,"Renovated since hurricane, looks great, new facilities, great staff, lots of parking. They do lots of shows, July 4-7: Florida Supercon ( a comic book, video game show ), they have celebrities that do Q&A sessions some with films."
decent hall,August 2019,50,Miami Beach Convention Center,135clintt,"we went here for a BIG SHOW convention and the place was really huge and well laid out, perfect place for a convention."
VG,December 2018,40,Miami Beach Convention Center,BigoBoca,The rehabilitation to this structure improved the look of the nondescript building that had been there for many years.
Beautiful Photo Art,January 2019,50,Lik Miami,GeorgeFMarkhamON,"This is a free museum, and you might just buy an artwork to take home. Much better than the politically correct-infused National Geographic store nearby."
Worth a stroll but do not buy! ,February 2019,30,Lik Miami,CeciT_13,Stunning photography but prices are way too high. This is not a good investment. Read the reviews on the internet before making a purchasing decision. 
Worst experience ever,June 2019,10,Port of Miami,Androcasper,Dont waste your vacation and money with them
Well organised,June 2019,40,Port of Miami,benleigh77,"The port is well set up and seemed easy enough to get around.  Just be cautious of the arrival of ships as there are taxi's, ubers and shuttles everywhere and they just stop with no regard for anyone.  The carparks are easy to access once you know which one is best for you.  Best place to park for a cruise as it's very convenient which you do pay for but worth every cent to me.  It's important to remember that there can be over 5,000 people on one ship so that's a lot of people looking for taxis and shuttles.  The other carparks can't handle the volumes regardless of what they say.  Port is very clean, well kept and very secure.  "
Best experience ever at a cruise port.,June 2019,50,Port of Miami,Mark31651,"We started our cruise with Royal Caribbean here and it was a very efficient boarding process.  We checked in on line, dropped our suitcases outside (later delivered to our stateroom door), were directed to an esculator, showed some id's, directed to a large waiting area with chairs, waited just a few minutes, directed to the ship (by group designation), showed our id's and welcomed aboard.  Wow!  The building is stunning, with lots of glass and art!"
Good cruise port,June 2019,50,Port of Miami,Twinsmom99,We have used terminal A twice in the past four months. I thought this cruise port was well organized and efficient. We didn’t have any problems checking in for our cruise. It was quick to get on Royal Caribbean’s ships. Getting an Uber at the end of the cruise was a little tedious but what do you expect with so many people exiting the terminal?
"Great port, easy to board your ship",August 2018,50,Port of Miami,Stefan6913,"Port of Miami has it down to a science when knowing exactly what to do with its passengers and how to get them on the ship quickly and without any problems.  I'm so impressed by this port that I will be sailing out again in a few months.  Granted the cruise line I was on, the ship was very small so it had a limited number of passengers which made things much easier.  Lines that have ships with 4,000 or more passengers, I can imagine it is longer to get onto the ship and through the various processes to get onboard, but from everything that I saw they know exactly how to keep things moving and regularly do this so its no big deal for them."
Beautiful ,February 2019,50,Lik Miami,danfriedmanmd,Such a wonderful gallery and the curator was amazing! Ask her to show you what happens to these incredible photographs in different lighting. 
Beautiful Art - Very Unique,July 2019,40,Lik Miami,Mdefil23,This is one of the coolest spots on Lincoln Road to see after dinner. You'll be amazed at some of the pieces. It's just very expensive.
Wish I was Rich,March 2019,50,Lik Miami,Voyager789044,Gorgeous photos. I want them all. Worth seeing even if you can't afford them. What a special collection! I live down the street and frequently go in to put me in a great mental space.
Place must have seen,December 2018,50,8th Street Designer District,VALENTIN02_58,Comparing this side to the one 8 years ago ist unbelievable what has been created since then.designer shops as well as galeries has been set up definitely a place which should be visited when in Miami 
A place to be and a place to be seen,January 2019,50,8th Street Designer District,A. V,We walked around this place for hours. Lots of very expensive stores. But window shopping is great! You see thinks you enjoy them and your wallet does not suffer. This place is very interesting. Do visit!
Magic in the middle of nowhere,April 2019,50,8th Street Designer District,Michael L,You will not believe what you will see
Conspicuous consumption,June 2019,30,8th Street Designer District,huggio,"A nice place to walk, and handy for shopping if you're in to bling. I wouldn't make a special trip just to see it."
Nice Area for Window Shopping,October 2019,40,8th Street Designer District,TheDealBeans,"This is a nice area to walk around an window shop. Plenty of interesting 'Arty' type shops to look in. Nice if you are in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to get here."
Royal Caribbean Terminal A,April 2019,40,Port of Miami,WannaBeCruising,"I noticed that the Lyft driver got about half way in the terminal then just disappeared.  Another Lyft driver was automatically requested.  This happened several times.  Then, I got a driver who showed up.  As we walked over the driver cancelled.  Then he picked up the man standing next to me.  I told him he was my driver and he said he was not.  I had his picture, vehicle and license plate on the app.  He refused me, so I had to request another driver.  The same thing happened.  Halfway in the port they disappeared and another driver was requested automatically.  I spoke to this driver and he said he had never heard of Zone 8 and was being sent out of the port.  He finally found me and got me picked up and to the airport after waiting 45 minutes.  Other people were getting Lyft drivers so I don’t know what I did wrong.  I contacted Lyft and they did know either.  They said they were disciplining the driver that cancelled me.  I was told by our driver that where I was standing was brand new.  I really don’t know."
Easy process to get through Security and Employees Wonderful!,October 2018,40,Port of Miami,Hialeah73,"Very easy process, all very organized. I would say leaving a car that you drove to port in one of the parking lots on or off site was the biggest issue. Allow plenty of time to park and wait for a shuttle. Ours had a very long line of people waiting. It took the shuttle bus several trips before it was our turn. This part was a bit stressful with your family waiting at the port. If everyone dropped off the traveling partners at the port. Then parked it would move faster. As many of the delays in getting the shuttle was 6, 8 10 persons traveling together all trying to board the shuttle. If it was one or two persons per family it would be better. Also, upon return there again was a delay that can not be avoided as they need to have more shuttles since whole families ride together to get the car."
Easy Port,April 2019,40,Port of Miami,imdarkside,This is simply a port to get on your cruise ship. Not a tourist site to see.  However this port entry is easy to get into and out of.
"Quick, efficient staff",March 2019,40,Port of Miami,gjoesimmons,"If you're not used to visiting a cruise port, they're huge and have tons of people.  But the staff here was well versed at quickly and efficiently moving everyone along to their destination."
Reggae Rhythm & Blues Cruise 2019,May 2019,50,Port of Miami,diamond012015,If you cannot find a sitter 
Nice facility but embarkation was chaos,April 2019,20,Port of Miami,Brian0ntheGo,"Our RCCL departure was a mess.  The facility was pleasant enough, but the port staff members, while friendly, were disorganized.  One person would tell us to do one thing and another staff member would come along and tell us to do the opposite.  Perhaps their issues stemmed from our ship arriving late, thus complicating the embarkation process, but things could not have become more chaotic.  The view from the port is certainly great being located so close to the city, but the traffic was challenging as well.  We parked our car with Safe Cruise Parking and found it to be just as advertised.  We'd use them again to save lots of money over the Port of Miami parking garage.  I hope our particular departure from the Port of Miami was unusual.  While I would not avoid a cruise that departed Miami, I won't be in a rush to use this port in the future."
One of the better ports,April 2019,40,Port of Miami,nvtriker,This is one of the better embarkation Cruise ports we've been to. The worst part is the traffic getting to the port. Hopefully next year the new building at terminal Be done and help with some of the congestion getting in the building. This is much better experience than the NYC Manhattan Cruise terminal.
Love it!,March 2019,50,Port of Miami,mjrenb1,The Port of Miami is a few steps away from Bay Side shopping and wonderful restaurants. If you plan on going to Miami this place is a must. The Port itself is very busy. It is where many cruise ships set sail from.
A bit choatic yet very efficient,February 2019,40,Port of Miami,François G,"You're getting on a cruise ? You will notice the impatience of taxi drivers in line for a drop or pick up... Impatient and pushy with all the other cars... Yet, everything works pretty good with the help of officers directing traffic. "
Nice building but terrible design and staff,April 2019,10,Port of Miami,Mdwramp22,I said the hell with this and went over to the Uber area for more gridlock and it took an hour for my driver to get to us due to the gridlock! I’m an experienced cruiser and this was the first and last time using port Miami! I’ll be taking myself back to Everglades or Canaveral!
Miami Heat,November 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,racheldon1987,The atmosphere is incredible and I had such a great time.  Even better the Heat won!!
Marlins Park,August 2019,40,Marlins Park,387indy,"The baseball team has Marlins Park, a state of the art ball field. It has great concession stands, facilities, parking, and well maintained."
Cruise port parking,February 2019,40,Port of Miami,Normand L,"Good place to leave car. Huge port. Ship docked at different location at cruise return. Had a shuttle bus to go where car was parked. Only problem is that parking employee told me that the credit car did not work so I paid cash to find out that the amount was approved by the credit card company but to the best of my knowledge was never charged to my account. Strongly suggest that if you park there, keep the receipt."
"Cruise to St Marten, Puerto Rico, Haiti",January 2019,50,Port of Miami,nyrunr,Port of Miami was the Departure and return for our family cruise. Very well organized with a swift process.
Can walk to Port from Bayside Marketplace,February 2019,50,Port of Miami,Cybertalent,Arrived early for a cruise so went to Bayside Marketplace after dropping off our luggage at port. There is a bridge near the port you can walk across to downtown Miami. Beautiful views from bridge!
Great Trip,March 2019,50,Port of Miami,Crystal_M_Cochran,We took shuttle to P.O.M. from FLL airport. Curb service was great! They took our luggage as soon as we pulled in the Port....which was very early. 
Social hour,November 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Blessing2020,"It was very good, it’s all your personal view, you will be able to visit and see how you like it for yourself"
Please “Don’t”,June 2019,30,Perez Art Museum Miami,Elien B,"The tour guide was great and able to place the modern art in historic context, hence 3 stars. The cafe is $$ and space in bad weather is lacking to enjoy some downtime comfortably. The collection I think is limited. If with kids I think the Frost Museum of Science (with whom PAMM shares the paved parking garage at their end), is a way better choice (not personal experience, but hearsay)."
Very big port,February 2019,40,Port of Miami,jlipp5240,"Most hotels have free transportation here, if not you can always get a taxi or Uber."
Terminal A - Royal Caribbean,February 2019,50,Port of Miami,care4many,Have to admit we really did not want to pay the price but our travel agent said it would be worth it and he was right!  After the grueling traffic to get there we had smooth sailing from the moment we pulled in to the port.  Terminal A is amazing!  We pulled up and the porters took our checked bags - found a parking spot - took elevator and walked into the terminal.  Within 15 minutes we were ON THE SHIP!!!  When we came back into port a week later we were off the Symphony of the Seas within 20 minutes - and in our car and heading to our next destination in minutes.  It was so easy!  No waiting for shuttles - nothing.  We had avoided Miami port as much as possible in the past as difficult to find safe parking and hotels are very pricey.  We had stayed night in Dania Beach/Ft Lauderdale and drove in the morning.  It was definitely very easy and made the transition from a trip to a VACATION happen in minutes!  You get what you pay for!
Best Parking is the Pits.,February 2019,10,Port of Miami,Gary H,This is for Best Parking at the Port of Miami.  The check in process was way too slow.  Need at least two people on the 7th floor checking people in.  Waiting on the Can was the worst experience I’ve had.  It took over twenty minutes for the first van to show up then there wasn’t enough room so we had to wait another 20-30 minutes Firth’s next one.  Very poor system with the multiple terminals at the port of Miami.  The pick-up was just as bad.  We were off the ship by 7:30 and didn’t get picked up until 8:20.  Terrible Terr terrible.  The van we rode in had a check engine light on as well as a low tire light.  The van was in terrible condition.  I for one will not be using best parking again.
If you park your car,February 2019,10,Port of Miami,maryk19958,"Don't use BEST CRUISE PARKING, also known as PARKWAY PARKING.  We recently waited for one hour and 15 minutes for a van to pick us up to return to the parking garage.  After waiting for 45 minutes, I started making a list of the vans who came at least once,  to pick up their customers.  You'll be better off parking with: Miami Prime, EG, Premier (they came by 6 times while we were waiting), Hyatt Place, KSA Tours, Thrifty, Cross Culture Tours, Doral, Rental Car Shuttle, Angel Wings.  Best Cruise Parking.com seems to have only one little bus.  They actually came after 30 minutes, but were full and said they would come right back to get us.  The round trip to the garage must have taken 45 minutes.  We were waiting while it was raining in sheets."
Top Drawer Arena for Sports and Music,July 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,David A,"The Heat are making one last run for greatness under Pat Riley. Does he still have it? We'll soon find out. But the AAA is the state's most plush arena -- BB and T in Broward is the poorer cousin. Seen many greats there -- like Springsteen, McCartney, Hall and Oats, and the Who. Great amenities, and you can park far away and get there easily on the People Mover -- which is free, and the best deal in Miami."
Best experience in Miami! Many thanks to Fabian and the welcoming staff!,September 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,ccstefan,"Thank you very much, Fabian and Lock & Load Miami!"
Great service in the rain! ,June 2019,40,Marlins Park,954hurricane,Thank you! 
Quick and organized,January 2019,50,Port of Miami,sunworshipperAlberta,The terminal check in was very smooth.  We were dropped off in the parking lot and there was someone there to gather our luggage then we were directed to the enterance of the terminal.  From the time of drop off until we stepped on the ship it was approximately 40 minutes which I thought was really great
Terminal A - great experience,January 2019,50,Port of Miami,13betty,"We left on Allure of the Seas and it was a quick, smooth check in.  When we returned, it was very easy off.  The only snag was the pick up by shuttle to pick up our car due to all of the cars and buses coming in."
So Much Better,February 2019,50,Port of Miami,davidhH3816ZT,"We easily got on the ship and upon our return, our daughter met us where she had dropped us off. We got into the port and out of the port in less than 5 minutes. So smooth and much, much less chaotic!! Great job, Port of Miami. Instead of screwing thongs up, as other ports are doing as cruise traffic increases around the nation, you all have figured a way to smooth out the process and make it so much more enjoyable coming and going from your port!! Thanks and keep up the good work!!"
love pulling up,February 2019,50,Port of Miami,Loretta R,The port is so well organized and orderly for all the ship to embark and disembark. Getting through customs is getting shorter with more efficient employees. 
Pleasantly surprised,July 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,58FunTimes,Good job!
Do it NOW! ,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Lambur,EXCELLENT experience ! very easy process to start didn’t even take 15 mins before we were ready to get some target practice. Our instructor “Max” was very patient and great teacher. Overall experience was flawless deff recommend it and try out the “Desert Eagle” you will not regret it 
Fabulous stadium,May 2019,50,Marlins Park,John H,"Brilliant facilities but very expensive food and drinks, compared to the $10 entrance fee. Really impressive stadium."
Beautiful Ball Park - Friendly Staff,May 2019,40,Marlins Park,emteetribe,"What a beautiful ball park.   Drove over from Tampa and stayed at hotel near the hospital - walking distance.  Great park, too bad nobody goes to games there.  Bobblehead ""museum"" is a must see!"
Cruise,January 2019,10,Port of Miami,Linda Z,This port is terrible. There is no organisation just a cop going mad with his whistle. You can’t drop off your baggage for a cruise. We had to park in the car park then lug the cases over the road to be checked in.
Holiday family cruise,December 2018,30,Port of Miami,Christine C," Embarkation on 12/30 was super easy.  Luggage taken as soon as we stopped the car.    Parked in the parking structure.  Walked through all checkpoints without waiting.  All personnel were helpful and courteous.    Returning on 1/6 was a different story.  The baggage claim was super crowded.  Luggage porters were yelling to move out of the way but there was no way to go.  The baggage claim was on the opposite side of the parking structure and we had to walk close to 2 blocks (due to barriers)  with luggage.    Best embarkation port, but not so good for debarkation."
New port terminal,December 2018,50,Port of Miami,jeannew162,The new port terminal at the port of Miami is very refreshing and well organized. Was very crowded but we were in and aboard the ship in less than 30 minutes!
Very convenient,January 2019,50,Port of Miami,Kalvin S,We came here for a Disney cruise trip and found the port to be very convenient from downtown Miami.  No problems at all!
wonderful outing with family,April 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Luletha C,"my 3yr old grandson celebrated part of his bday visiting the museum which thoroughly enjoyed, it was great fun for the adults as well."
The name says it all!,August 2017,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),ransom007,"Located on the second floor, WEAM is all its name indicates. It is chock full of paintings, sculptures, photographs, etc., depicting erotica. The biggest problem I had with the visit was finding parking in Miami Beach. The exhibits cover erotica from all over the world and numerous time periods. If you appreciate this type of art, I wholeheartedly recommend WEAM for you. It is also much larger than it appears from the street."
Maybe the cleanest ballpark around,April 2019,40,Marlins Park,Michael P,"On the down side, attendance is poor which detracts from the game day experience.  An enthusiastic home crowd could make this place really special.  On the night I went, the visiting Cubs had more fans."
"Very nice park, clean. Good place for a ballgame",April 2019,50,Marlins Park,DerrickintheKeys,Hotdogs and nachos were on the menu with some adult beverages and water after the 7th.  Two of our party smoke and they were able to find the smoking area quickly and it was well kept.
Beautiful Ball Park,May 2019,50,Marlins Park,rcardo21rv,"Marlins Park is beautiful, the seats are comfortable, it doesn’t matter where you seat you will have a nice view of the game, and the standing areas are great. There is a lot of great food options in Marlins Park, I think Marlins Park should be a must go place in Miami!!"
First visit to Marlins Park was 5-Star!,April 2019,50,Marlins Park,gary m,"I wasn't sure that I would like Marlins Park, but once there, I was pleasantly surprised.  The roof was wide open and it had the feel of a regular outdoor stadium.  We even had a nice breeze from time to time, of course it was still just April, so I am sure it will be hotter in the summer months.  Also, the Cubs won 3 games in a row.  Maybe not so enjoyable for Marlins fans."
"Lots of local food, fun to walk around and easy to get to",September 2018,50,Marlins Park,mh2320,"When we lived in Miami, went there all the time, reasonable family fun and really good food choices!"
A limited museum in a gorgeous building and location,October 2018,30,Perez Art Museum Miami,MiamiKM,"Miami had the possibility of having a wonderful museum, but it allowed one developer who gave it his name dictate much of its permanent collection, and alas, the result is a disappointment.  Every once in awhile it gets some interesting pieces in a traveling show, starting with the opening show by Ai Wei-Wei and including a recent pieces by Picasso.  The Lowe Museum at the University of Miami has a far stronger collection, as does the Ft. Lauderdale Museum of Art, and the best art museum in South Florida by far is the Norton in Palm Beach."
I the middle of the city,January 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,Michael L,very very  humble experience 
Not easy for an eldery person,March 2019,20,American Airlines Arena,annasF472NN,"I decided to take my mother to Andre Boccelli's concert which was spectacular but I did not count on the stairs so narrow and high for my mother. It was ny first and last time going to a concert there, it was very stressful probably my fault since I should have find out before going. In my personal opinion, it is not even secure for attendees if a fire and/or an emergency strikes de arena... God forgives. I do not recommend taking an eldery there unless you have the financial means to pay the ground sites which are located in the most expensive area."
Good place for a walk,January 2019,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,susanduran,I really liked the PAMM. They have some amazing things to look and feel. The whole place is artistic and cool. Don’t mind taking good pictures when you go there ️
Nice ball park but the food vendors are the worst.,April 2019,40,Marlins Park,orangeman13,"I am only writing this review because I am hoping somebody in food service reads this. For the most part the people working at the park were nice and helpful. The park is really nice and easy to get around. All this changed when I went to order food. When your waiting in line the workers will hold up a sign to tell you they will take the next person. So when I went over to order the person took off and never came back. I then went to the next person holding the sign and he said I should have stayed where I was but I told him that she took off and never came back. I ordered the Cubin sandwich and after I paid he came back and said that it would be 5 minutes before I could get my sandwich. I waited a whole inning waiting to get my sandwich and missed a couple of runs. If he would have told me they were not available I would have ordered something else. Later in between innings,  I went up to get a pretzel  and 5 people were standing around talking and no one wanted to wait on me. I could not believe that I had to interrupt them to get my food. If someone in customer service sees this Please do something."
A must visit while in Miami,April 2019,50,Marlins Park,ShelleyOC88,"On our recent trip to Florida we went to Miami for the weekend and had to catch a baseball game - our first ever one! Atmosphere was great, game was great and they won! Nice arena and comfortable seats."
"Beautiful Park, cheap parking, cheap seats",April 2019,40,Marlins Park,dkc_liv,"I loved the stadium, parked right across the street for $20. $40 seat was first row second deck right at first base. (Too bad the on field product was bad)..easy in/out."
Great experience,April 2019,40,Marlins Park,has74,A great experience for anyone visit8ng the US.  Lots of crowd interaction.  Food not great - mainly burgers or hot dogs
Great place to see a ball game,April 2019,50,Marlins Park,Bowlerx_424,Go see the Marlins or your home team.   Worth the visit
Emotionally Moving...,December 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,rudy_c2000,"Amazing memorial, this one really makes you feel what it was like for the Jewish people, and reminds us how lucky we are to be alive and live in a free country. The walk down to the center island with the hand was the most moving experience I have ever had at a memorial, and I don’t have any personal Jewish connection. Just the humanity of it all...amazing piece of art!"
Miami Heat or El Heat,March 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,MartinBellin,"We had the chance to visit one of the games, or better basketball events. They are always worth a visit especially if you are not familiar with sport events in the USA like us as we are from Europe. But be prepared to consider extra time for getting back to your place. Traffic around the arena after the game is chaotic and impossible. Take a stroll 2 or 3 blocks down and call the Uber right then. "
Nobody Home,November 2018,30,Perez Art Museum Miami,Michael L,"The Perez Museum is a stunning structure, with innovative tropical landscaping and a great location on the Bay. What a shame that there's nothing inside. The temporary Christo exhibition about wrapping Miami's islands in 1983 was mildly interesting, but Hew Locke's colorful suspended boat collection was the only bright spot in the museum's abysmal permanent collection. I was very impressed by the building but going inside was a waste of time."
love it,December 2018,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,merry8it,"I've only been here twice, but i'm a big fan. It's a fairly small museum, so it's easy to see everything. Even if you're not loving the art on display, their outdoor areas are cool and fun. Great museum shop, too."
Great Park. Lousy team.,April 2018,30,Marlins Park,feason99,Not too big and not too small. Hardly a seat that has an awful view. Airconditioned for those excruciating Miami summer nights. Now if only there was an exciting team to watch.
Beautiful Ballpark!,May 2018,40,Marlins Park,Brian D,This is one of the nicest ballparks in the States. Too bad the team in a mess. Try not to go to a game in the dead of Summer. It gets hot out there!
Marlins 2018,July 2018,50,Marlins Park,Dylan S,"Marlins Park is cool and fun to see baseball games. Despite falling down, the Marlins staff checked me out and made sure I didn't suffer any long-tern injuries. "
Ballgame with the Guys,July 2018,40,Marlins Park,nibaldom2015,"Marlins Park is very comfortable place to watch a ballgame. The restaurants and the Clevelander Bar is pretty nice. I know the team is not great, but the Park has plenty to see and do while at the Park. Come and enjoy the Park."
Reminder of history ,November 2018,40,Holocaust Memorial,H2139UZseanl,Thought provoking especially during nationalistic times in USA. The statues were amazing and the words on the plaque quite sad 
"Wonderful, interactive facility!",February 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Angela N,"Kids and adults will enjoy this venue. It is open air, but with cover so you can visit in inclement weather, no problem.  The views over the water are incredible! There are many wonderful exhibits, a planetarium with several shows, a good cafe, and MetroMover station on site. Purchase tickets on line at least 2 days prior and save a few dollars per ticket. Enjoyed!"
Architecture Tour at 11am ,November 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Traveler123020,"There is an architecture tour at 11am, and it was excellent. We learned about the history of the museum and the inspiration for the design. In addition, we learned about the materials and the cobaix building process that allowed for the expansive galleries. The permanent collection is manageable, and we enjoyed the Christo exhibit. "
Wonderful location and great installations,November 2018,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,paudraigmurphy,"We visited in mid-November and it was easy to see everything, two school kids tours, and a lot of overseas visitors but no crushes. The hanging gardens, the model boats, the Christo pink island display and the wonderful “when the dew is still on the roses” all kept us busy. The only down side was the restaurant where getting a cup of coffee and a snack is a nightmarish experience. One other piece of advice to the management is to hook up with the science museum and discount double tickets."
baseball fun!,September 2018,40,Marlins Park,Tropicalmich,what a nice intimate stadium. very good tickets available at great prices. we paid $22 per ticket row 9 1st baseline. drinks were expensive like every sporting event. note not really any bars around stadium.
"Good game, so so food",September 2018,30,Marlins Park,MRVEGAS711,"The Marlins don't draw much of a crowd and I think dining at this park suffers from that. We did enjoy the way over-staffed game with a probable attendance of 6000 (several hundred workers doing nothing). Good sightlines. Concessions was a bust though. My Beer tasted like it came from Aprils Keg and the hot dogs tasted a week old. Pop Corn not much better. It felt like food was used until it was gone. And in the Marlins case, that might take a month!"
NYY @ Tampa Bay,October 2017,50,Marlins Park,claudia B,Love to go to the games NYY/Tampa Bay in St Pete Florida.  We stay at a hotel near the Park and do tourism always.
Take Me Out To The Ballgame,June 2018,50,Marlins Park,HectorR2167,A+++
Boring!  Like an over-rated high school game!,August 2018,10,Marlins Park,thevuzoo,"We’ve visited many many baseball parks around the country. This park is one of the worst in terms of excitement, fan participation and energy. The park looks well maintained but I felt like I was watching a bad high school game. The team and the fans had low energy and no pride. I’m surprised that they had cheerleaders at the game!  I’ve never seen cheerleaders at any baseball game.  But the cheerleaders weren’t good at all - they seemed like second rate performers. This stadium also plays a lot of Latin music.  "
First rate Activity Park,July 2014,50,Flamingo Park,Brendan42,"This park has it all . Central location ,first rate facilities , whether that is to take a swim , play a game of tennis or just study the talent of the many games that America has to offer "
Spectacular Place to Learn while Having FUN!,January 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Gaiatribe,"I was blown away with the scope of this Science Museum. At the very start of our day, a movie in the wonderful Planetarium, The Dynamic Earth (one of four movies they offer), we were brought from outer space thru our solar system, to the earth, thru the atmosphere in the rush of a falling meteor to Miami and utlimately to our seats! And that was just the opening.!  I found the entire place to be wonderfully laid out to edu-tain the young and older. We started on the rooftop and worked our way down. The centerpiece is definitely the 6 story tank that affords views on every level of the wonders of our sealife. But equally great were the smaller tanks that represented, coral reefs and the inhabitants as well as other habitats like Mangroves.  There were 'petting' tanks for stingrays, and starfish.  The displays of Jellyfish alone were worth a visit. Birds and gators and all things that fly in the south Fla area were also nicely represented. The DiVinci museum was inspiring. There is an 80 million yr old fish fossil and many other examples of the wonders of this planet.  There were some areas that were not available to view, but even with that, I would allow at least 4 hrs to enjoy this museum."
Montreal Bachelor Party,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,varun013,We ended our bachelor party weekend at the gun range with an amazing experience. This is a must do to all those groups of people celebrating their bachelor party in Miami. Nick took care of the group and did an amazing job explaining the rules and safety protocol. He broke down every gun we were using with history and facts.  He went above and beyond for the bachelor and definitely added the cherry on top for our weekend. Highly recommend him and he's hilarious!
Lunch at Verde Bistro Capped Art  Museum Visit,October 2018,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,VKauf2014,"Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Surrounded Islands is the featured exhibit and presentation at the museum until February 17, 2019. I was impressed with the bistro and had an enjoyable lunch with my sisters who were visiting from out of town."
Beautifully designed,October 2018,30,Perez Art Museum Miami,286klairb,This museum has unique art collections. There is some variety. The buildings architecture and furnishings are beautiful. Not sure if you get a lot of value for the price solely on the exhibits. There are few descriptions of th art itself although good artist biographies. There are also detailed panphlets but too much to read in a visit. I certainly would not benefit from a membership. Small children would not get much out of it although the environment is suitable for kids.  the gift shop has one of the best selections I’ve seen in the area!  To me that’s the most enticing part of the museum.
A very interesting stadium...,September 2018,30,Marlins Park,schmayla98,"Another weird but positive is all the standing room. There is an ample amount and honestly, I wish I would have known this and paid for the cheapest ticket because it offers some of the best views."
Nice ballpark,September 2018,40,Marlins Park,Johnny M,"Cons: No public transit to get to the park, and not many bars/restaurants around; lack of attendance makes it feel empty."
Fantastic Experience,September 2018,50,Marlins Park,EmmaStevenson1983,We made our own way there on the bus but got the shuttle back to the metro on the way home to get back to Miami Beach.
Good day for the entire Family,October 2017,40,Marlins Park,PPDMD,"Nice place to pass a good time with family. I recommend to reserve the parking ahead, better than park outside. Easy access to bathroom, food and other services."
Outstanding ,August 2018,50,Marlins Park,juanz564,"Went to Marlins Park for the first time since it opened and it was well worth it got my ticket for the clevelander  level right at the front of left field, and believe me it was worth it.  It’s a must to go and watch a game."
So moving - powerful landmark,November 2017,40,Holocaust Memorial,Stella-Dot,"This has to be on your list of places to visit if you are in Miami.  The soundtracks being played add to the overall experience of the place. The 'hand' can be seen from far away and as you venture past the well known statues you enter into a breath-taking arena depicting the horrors of what took place, in statue form.   There is information on the walls and a sense of quiet and calm as visitors make their way around the openair exhibits.  It is breathtaking in the extreme.  The only problem I had was negotiating the puddles and rainfall which does not seem to drain away.  Take your time to read as much of the information as you can."
"Unbelievable collection of 'art', for a little Jewish lady",July 2016,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Ross-K-68,"I came out with two weird sensations - the fact I appeared to be the only man visiting - the second what would be thought of me as I emerged from the semi darkness with a sticker on my chest excelling erotic art. You might find it a little repetitive as you look around, but I concluded the human mind is not governed to take in so much in one go. I spent over an hour and breezed past the last few exhibits as I was beginning to feel as the only visible guest, that some of the things were staring back at me. I can guarantee you won't see another exhibit like it."
Huge collection!,August 2016,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Justine L,Very happy we checked this place out. Worth the money as there's tonnes to see.
Amazing experience,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Chloe J,We came to lock and load Miami having never shot a gun before and Will was so kind and understanding with us explaining everything to us so that we had as much fun as possible! This was a once in a lifetime experience I would definitely recommend this to anyone! Thanks for everything Will!
Amazing Experience ,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,sidlambersky,"If you have never done this, it really is worth the time and money.   We will be going back.  "
Visual Delight,June 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Miriam W,"Treat yourself and treat your family to the wonder of this special museum in the heart of Miami.  Register online to learn about various events and activities, many of which are specific for children."
Museum a good home for modern art,September 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,619jeffry,"George Perez, a Miami real estate developer, endowed this fine museum. It has a very good collection of modern and contemporary art. It has a Picasso on display which is worth in excess of $100 million. You may not like some of the exhibits, but give it a try. By the way, leave your car at home and take the Omni Line (gratis) and get off at the Museum Station. You can also go to the Science Museum."
PAMM,September 2018,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,samuel8248,"Modern facilites. Part of Blue Star Museums. Nice shop, Football exhibition was nice and some work by Picasso"
Nice Park,August 2018,40,Marlins Park,Maverick33C,Here to see NY Yankees.  Place was pretty crowded.  Had fun of course.  We had box seats first base.  Seats were great.  Would have cost a fortune at Yankee Stadium so good to have reasonable priced good seats here.  Roof was on so that was a plus with the heat.  My phone died so we couldn't get uber ride home.  They had a special uber lot but without using app would not let us ride.  Before my phone died ride would have been $2.79 to hotel.  They had a row of uber cars there too.  Ended up getting a taxi for $20 to go 1 mile.  We had walked there from hotel but not very safe at night to walk back.  But a terrific stadium to go to. Lots of beer stations and food.
"Great stadium, warm atmosphere",August 2018,50,Marlins Park,Ghislain B,"Even if baseball is not my favourite sport, we had a great time."
Baseball fun,August 2018,50,Marlins Park,teresawP8128AK,Marlins park is a great place to catch a game. We sat on the left field side in sections 26 and 28.  Our seats were great. You can even see home plate. My husband caught a foul ball and was on tv!  The music is very upbeat and entertaining. It is a beautiful park in a not so great section of town. We used Uber service there and back.  The only issue is the Uber lines were very unorganized at the park after the game.
A great ballpark,August 2018,50,Marlins Park,Juanmago78,"Marlins Park is a great place, easy to get to, lots of things to do, it even has a bar with a swimming pool in the left field, the Clevelander! Shame the team is not doing very well..."
Impressed ...,August 2018,50,Marlins Park,foodtester214,"Did visit yesterday , i was really impressed by the work they have done with the stadium , and plus with the area as well... Nice"
Little Local Park,October 2014,30,Flamingo Park,Susan G,There are multiple tennis courts here and I have yet to learn how to sign up and use them. I usually walk through the park on my way to Lincoln Road.During the daytime I always feel safe and it is a large green area in the city. You could picnic here however it is too hot! There are trees.
Must see!,July 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,rosieg429,This I cant even begin how to describe. It was a beautiful memorial and although it left me feeling sad it was a must see! Parking is a bit tricky but well worth it. 
It's worth a half hour walk thru,July 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,Retemslt,The memorial is all out doors but most of it is shaded.  The memorial tells the story of the Holocaust on marble panels with photos and engravings.  One of the highlights is the hand sculpture.  It's worth seeing no matter if you are a Christian or Jew.
A day at the Museum,January 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,WayneSommer,Finally made it to the Frost Museum of Science in Miami! Cool planetarium great architecture stunning views of the City and the Port of Miami. In some ways more of an Aquarium than a Museum I think the Frost will only get bigger and better as new exhibits are unveiled. A great day with family!
Outstanding Museum,January 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Southern104,"We visited with three grandchildren ages 10, 8 and 5. We spent nearly four hours and left with lots of things left to do. This is an exceptional museum with many unique exhibits and hands on activities. You could spend an hour in just the engineering lab. The admission fee includes a planetarium show and we saw Dynamic Earth and it was great. Children enjoyed the aquarium but I think they liked the MeLab best. Food is expensive and you might want to consider bringing your own especially if you have a lot of children."
Heat vs Rockets,December 2018,40,American Airlines Arena,LiamCr,Got the chance to see James Harden tear it up and Heat come away with the win!! Vice Nights!
The Heat,December 2018,50,American Airlines Arena,DeborahHLondon,"Went to watch Heat vs Timberwolves. Great experience, fantastic food and drink choices wish British arenas/sports grounds were the same!  It was loud and in your face but brilliant fun."
Miami Heat vs Cavaliers,December 2018,50,American Airlines Arena,LusandraC,Entrance was too slow and started to rain outside. But once pass the security is well guided and service everywhere. Clean and great amenities... Love it!
Great Arena!,December 2018,40,American Airlines Arena,Brian D,Whether you are here for a concert or a game there are very few bad seats in the house. The acoustics are very good too!
NBA Match,December 2018,50,American Airlines Arena,764alexisd,"If you are in Miami, don’t miss the chance to see the Miami Heats playing!!! "
The building...,January 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,SteveGoldgap,...is very attractive and a nice addition to the PMMA. We decided to only enjoy it from outside as it seemed to be mainly for children or people with limited „scientific“ education. Anyway - we have been wrong but avoided the noise and overentertainment.
Kids will have fun,December 2018,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Culture1941809354,Worth for a single time visit if you have kids. Not too extra ordinary but the kids had fun in the first buidling.We have to pay extra for the shows which is  a ding and so we didn't go to those. Purchased an explorer- Go miami card
Wow! Fantastic Museum!,January 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,GoPlacesMac73,What an incredible museum! We absolutely loved the exhibits. We were lucky to visit when the DaVinci exhibit was still running. It was fantastic. We loved all the hands-on activities. The planetarium show was also phenomenal. I learned after the fact that I could have received a discount on my admission because I'm an educator (even though I teach in a state other than Florida). So teachers- bring your ID if you visit this museum for an admission discount.
Must see for all religious and non religious alike,July 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,734coopers,There is beauty and sadness at the memorial. A true tribute to the holocaust
very impressive,January 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,collenlong,A very impressive monument. The large concrete blocks with a top surface as large as a grave's make you feel small when you walk among them. Especially in the middle where the stones tower far above you. At night some of the paths are illuminated and several paths are also wheelchair acc
Powerful memorial,February 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,WanderingWoman75,"Though the memorial is outdoors, a great deal of the area is shaded. It is well worth at least 30 minutes of your time while in Miami."
lovely park,November 2014,40,Flamingo Park,Bella W,Centrally located park with lots of green space. Nice fresh water pool. Diverse activities. Nice place to drop off or pick up a rental bike too. Quieter than beach side parks but a short walk or bike ride from anywhere you could want to go in SoBe.
Local park,November 2014,50,Flamingo Park,Andy D,"Great to experience locals. Great to cool off in the shade on a hot day. Enjoy the vegetation, the space, play sports, just be there on a day  when locals come home from work"
For locals only,December 2014,20,Flamingo Park,RomainDaSilva,The park provides sports fields so good for locals but not much to see for tourists even if it is pleasant to cross a park in the middle of the city.
Great find!,December 2014,50,Flamingo Park,amandaonthemove,"Very large park with lots to do, was only about a 15 minute walk from our hotel at Collins/7th. We did not go in the pool, though it looked awesome, and my kids really enjoyed the playground equipment as it was more geared to older kids, which you don't find much. Lots of shady areas and places to sit, tennis courts, soccer field, clean bathrooms"
Amazing Futbol Exhbit,September 2018,30,Perez Art Museum Miami,schmayla98,"Also, the dumbest photo policy ever... you can take all the photos you want with a cell phone, but you cannot use a simple point & shoot with the flash off? I understand not using a DSLR or a professional camera, but this is a little bizarre."
A highlight of my trip to Miami,November 2017,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Stella-Dot,"I love to go to art galleries and museums based on the arts, and I was not disappointed here at all.  It is mainly modern art and contemporary art in a building set in Biscayne Boulevard.  It was given to Miami by George Perez, a real estate developer, and the worth and value of this building and its contents has just grown and grown.  Miami is so lucky!  Some of the exhibits are enormous and some are exceptionally valuable - but the works of art have been laid out in a creative way that makes you want to look around again.  Highly recommended."
Max was great,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,JUBRILO3,"Thanks for great time Max and Vanessa. We visited on a whim and the service, hospitality and concern for safety were evident. We will be back."
Fun Fun Fun!,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,derrick b,I rate this 5 stars because we had a wonderful time! We learned a lot about guns from Fabian who was awesome!!!! We really enjoyed our time here. We highly recommend it!!
Welcome to the Gunshine State,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,ronin757,"Lock & Load is great if you’re looking for something other than the beach or alligators in the FL Everglades. One of the best ranges in terms of customer service, and FABIAN stands out as an instructor. Definitely going back!"
Good hilarious fun!,August 2016,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),selinav,"totally enjoyed it, it's a lot bigger than what it look like on the outside- cool mix of very memorable contemporary and antique pieces. LOL!!! A fun way to spend an hour or so, the appendages are everywhere!!!"
Interesting arrangement of Erotic Art,August 2016,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Poolegirly,"Spent a good couple of hours walking around, larger than we though but some beautiful art work. Many different styles and genres. Thoroughly enjoyable would recommend!"
Well Worth the Time and Money for a Memorable Trip,September 2016,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Allie S,"This had such an extensive collection of art. My friend and I came upon it by chance and had to see what it was all about. I am glad we went. It was quite the experience. Most of the art was interesting, some tasteful, some not so much. It was definitely worth the price. You see ancient and modern art from all over the world, in the form of photography, sculpture, paintings, and more. "
Miami Heat!!!,January 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,V3700KIscottb,If you’re in the area and Heat are playing it’s worth going to see. 
Great place for a concert,December 2018,50,American Airlines Arena,Julio G,"What we like about the American Airlines Arena was that we are able to get in and out of the parking very quickly.  Once the concert is over, you are home in thirty minutes and we live in West Kendall.  We saw six concerts there last year."
Miami Heat,September 2018,50,American Airlines Arena,Rileyj01,What an experience NBA at its best I attended the HEAT v LAKERS with my family and friends it was a great! The areana had everything!
Nice arena,February 2018,40,American Airlines Arena,michaelibrahim11,"Its the main arena in miami, located in downtown next to the bayside mall. The heat games take place over there and lots of other events."
Where's the signage,February 2019,30,American Airlines Arena,simo-jax,First time to arena to watch Heat v Bulls. Only thing hot was us after standing in queue for 30 mins only to find it was queue for checking in bags. No signage saying gate numbers. Others were confused too. Also seating plan showed our seats going thru gate 7 however when we got inside our seats were on other side of stadium ... and yes we first checked with staff. Very frustrating. Otherwise great stadium for viewing
Fun Days @ Frost,January 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,338lynnf,"I’m a member & been to the Frost museum 4-5 times.  It’s always a great time.  Recently, I took my 2 year old nephew who loved it.  He loved the aquariums and also the water tables- just beware, he loved it so much we had to make a visit to the museum shop to get a new T-shirt. (Consider bringing a change of clothes) .  I also recently went with 3 teenage boys for the “Sports & Science Day.”  We weren’t sure what to expect but we were a little underwhelmed - all activities were geared toward 6-8 year old kids.  The exception was the soccer table where some fun facts were shared.  I think a lot could be done to link spirts with the existing exhibits to appeal to all ages.  Fortunately, there was more than enough from the regular exhibits to keep the teens busy.  When you visit Frost, I highly recommend taking the Metro & getting there early, parking is expensive & afternoons get really packed."
Not a fan,May 2018,30,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,billjack333,Take the kids / grand kids and have a great time!
Frost Museum,January 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Shirlynn J,Very enjoyable day.  Great for all ages.  Beautiful views of the Miami skyline and the water.  Great food in the cafe located on site.
"Some nice exhibits, great views, but please hire more ticket staff!",January 2019,30,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Susan P,"I am glad we went and the kids had a good time, but I am sure glad that we didn't have to pay full price."
Amazing !!!!,January 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Luci-Daher-Laus,"This is a very nice museum for children of all ages. The exibits are very well organized and explained, and the planetarium shows are amazing. The aquarium is beautiful, not very large but the experience of looking at it from the bottom is so relaxing and incredible!"
Excellent memorial,August 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,IowaRod,This is a gut wrenching memorial to the jewish victims of the holocaust.  We went at sunset and the memorial was empty and well lit.  The statues are haunting and the information is very informative and does an excellent job of explaining the holocaust.
An emotionally moving depiction of the holocaust,August 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,Besabab,"I suggest combining this visit with a trip to the Miami Botanic Gardens, as the two attractions are literally next to each other. You also can simply pay for parking one time."
Great memorial,September 2018,40,Holocaust Memorial,beth ann k,"The memorial itself is well done, and the area is very nice.  Take some time to walk around it and see the memorial."
Awesome,September 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,Neuroone1,Extremely moving. A fitting tribute to the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis. No memorial can ever tell the whole story of the Holocaust but this memorial is there so that we will never forget
Fantastic,January 2015,40,Flamingo Park,Alessandro T,"A lot os options a few blocks from south beach Miami. You can walk, run, play basketball. You have restrooms, playground, it is complete!"
Very public park,February 2015,30,Flamingo Park,Ryan P,"This park is very big and has lots to do. It is also very packed and probably a top destination for families with children. It was to crowded for my comfort and I actually enjoyed lummus park playground, which is much smaller, more for the fact that there were only a few families there."
Great tennis!,February 2015,50,Flamingo Park,markperryart,"Flamingo Park is new and improved, the facilities and pros are great and for long term visits the beat deal for tennis anywhere. "
No flamingos here,February 2015,30,Flamingo Park,CanadiaTravellingMan,We walked all the way there expecting to find some flamingos but they do not exist. There is a ball park and sports facilities. However the walk there was worth it as you see a lot of Art Deco buildings.
Another great place to exercise or relax,March 2015,50,Flamingo Park,DAVID R,Away from the twenty years olds looking for party.  Quiet and a great place to exercise or watch sports.  Swimming pool open to the public (with a price unless you are a resident) lots of green space and no large groups of 20 year olds with coolers full of beer
Spectacular 😎,October 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,SnowBubby18,Spectacular setting for amazing museum of modern art. Outdoor art installations are interactive - incorporating the waterfront setting into the ambiance of the venue. Children and particularly teenagers  will enjoy this museum because of the interactive nature of some of the exhibits and the venue. 
Amazing building and setting,October 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,chrispducnrice,I went on a Thursday evening and there is a bar that’s open on outside podium with some music playing so you can absorb the views or perhaps just sit and relax in the swings.
Perez Museum,October 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Julio A,It is always a pleasure to spend a couple of hours wondering through the halls and exhibition rooms of this museum. It seems that every exhibit is expertly curated to caress your feelings and emotions in a very fulfilling way. Bravo!  
2nd amendment experience.,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,ralfUG9227BZ,"First of all, Thank you Fabian and the ""RED"" shirts for your service. The professionalism of the experience is top notch, the safety training, the weapon handling training, and the over all knowledge of the  weapons is top  notch.The video is awesome, it is totally worth to get the gopro camera.The packages are great and so many choices. If you like guns this is a major bucket item, i did mine. Now i'm just waiting for WW II weapon experience which is coming soon. One  thing that could be improved on...they need to get some 3XL t-shirts with panda with guns, they only had 2XL. The gun museum is awesome . ( I prefer to shoot them)"
AMAZING!,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Pierre-Emmanuel17,"And when I arrived everyone was very welcoming and most of all FABIAN. This guy got a lot of patience with the Frenchie that I am. He explained me all the technics, the history of each gun, and giving me self confidence. Thanks again for everything Fabian, I can’t wait to do it again!  "
Dream come true,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Michael F,Really good time there so if you are interested in guns this is the place for you.
Very fun and intense,June 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,juliengB9940EX,We both had a very good moment. Our monitor (A.K.A Max) was always by our side to give us tips about how to use the weapons which helped us a lot. He even gave my friend a new T-Shirt for free!! He do not regret our decision and press you to go to and try this place !!
We loved it,November 2016,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Dolly3972,"We found this museum by chance, so thought we would go in for a bit of fun, well it was really good fun but also really interesting. It's fascinating seeing other cultures view on sex and how the celebrated the human body. This in my view is a must see and well priced at $15, the lady working there was lovely and so helpful, have fun xxxx "
Something different,November 2016,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),franksC7072JU,"I saw this museum pop up on Google Maps, and I couldn't help but go visit.  If you're expecting some sort of voyeuristic experience then this isn't the place for you.  The exhibits are informative and very interesting.  There are a variety of displays, from print to sculpture."
Very Interesting,February 2016,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),WannaBfoodie,There are a lot of museums devoted to all kinds of Art this was unexpected but really captured sex thru many different cultures and forms of art. It was incredibly interesting to see all the different art forms that it was translated into. I would definitely recommend this to people traveling in the area. An experience you won't soon forget.
Definitely Interesting!!,December 2016,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),izuj,We enjoyed our awkward visit through the museum. It is pretty diverse in variety and I believe the collectors did a very good job. A lot of giggles were had and many head tilting and question marks :)
Loved it,December 2016,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),jcasey6314,"This is a fun place! A hidden gem, you could walk right past it if you weren't looking for it. Reasonably priced for such a different museum and the collection is huge! Definitely worth the trip! Take your significant other and be prepared to giggle. "
Just Another Arena,October 2018,30,American Airlines Arena,classact007B,This venue may be OK for basketball...but for concerts it is too big and has poor sight view from upper stand seats ... especially the side seats when trying to see the rear of the stage and video screens.
Friendly staff,February 2019,30,American Airlines Arena,jqmarcelino," The staff at the arena was extremely pleasant, however the security staff Was something to be desired years. Not all the security staff disrespectful seemed as though they could give it to you."
Disney show and Marvel superhero show,February 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,laeladesigner,"It's a great organized building, great security when entering, parking are underneath the building, and all around so no issues there. Plenty of restrooms."
Basketball visit,November 2018,40,American Airlines Arena,mmxmm,"Views from the seating were clear and there was plenty of leg room that made it enjoyable. Crowds were sparse up until the end of the second period, but no idea why. The only negative was the food and food service. The food was over cooked and inedible, and the servers were - to put it politely pedestrian. But overall a good night out."
Parking,February 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,Richard J,"Went to see Andrea Bocelli in Concert at the Arena on Valentines Day and the show was wonderful... however, I have to comment on the parking...$50 bucks for 3 hours was a bit exorbitant on any ones standards. Its kind of funny because I was low on cash (don't carry much anyway) and I stopped by a Publix and picked up a $Fifty. WOW! That went pretty quick!"
Science museum/aquarium/children's museum all in one! Great place to visit!,February 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Luv2TravelNEGirl,"We loved our visit here! Not going to lie though, the admission prices are crazy high but we luckily had a reciprocal program pass. There was a huge line to get tickets which seemed crazy so get them in advance online if you can (can't with the reciprocal ones). Definitely pay attention if you have annual passes to another museum if it is in the reciprocal program cause it is a really nice benefit! It doesn't, however, include the planetarium tickets which were about $5 extra I believe she said but we didn't do it cause wasn't sure our toddler would sit through it anyways but I heard wonderful things about it. The set up was a little confusing as it is all outdoor based and then you go up to the exhibits on different levels and on different ends. Didn't feel like it ""flowed"" great but it ultimately didn't impede our visit cause we still really loved all the exhibits. If you have a younger kid (toddler aged) the exhibit with the interactive wall/floor where the kids shine flashlights to see animals and can interact with everything was a huge hit with our three year old. And right outside of it there are really neat water table features that my son could have spent all day at! So many different things you can do to manipulate the water it was really awesome. They also have a full blown aquarium with an amazing shark tank with a huge viewing area that was so neat to see. Another favorite was the dance floor area that creates light ripples when you go on it! My son was obsessed! Everything here is very interactive and we learned a lot and really had fun! Exactly what a science museum should do! They do need to work on their café... we went over thinking we would grab lunch only to see an insane line that was not moving for fairly high priced lunch type items. It was colder and rainy out cause it looks like there is usually a food truck open outside but perhaps cause of the weather it was not. So just a suggestion to eat before or after from our experience."
great interactive museum,January 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,nutydiver,"great and interesting place to spend some time while in Miami, many interactive displays and an Imax theater "
World of amazement,February 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,michaelearle001,Great place filled with exciting and unforgettable activities. Much to learn and experience on any day.
"Superficial, very low-level.",February 2019,20,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,gross2017,Annoyingly superficial.  Not worth visiting.  I have been to science museums in a bunch of cities in the USA and Europe without ever seeing anything else so low-level.  Even the planetarium show was devoid of the kind of information that interests smart people of any age.
Not enough people know about it,September 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,timothymcnmara666,"What a surprise we were not aware it existed and too see it and havebthe background explained was historical , miami beach has abhigh population of jewish people andbthey have truly honoured the fallen.It is a must see andbrespect."
Heartbreaking ,October 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,ShanConf3477,"It's a nice memorial, but it's truly heartbreaking to see everything. The statues faces are so lifelike in some you can almost feel their terror. "
Devastating ,October 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,Xraykittykat,Statue is worth the drive to see and check out the history.  Very moving and tragic event.  The monument is beautiful.  The history behind is very educational to walk around and read the events.  If your even close to area check it out.  Parking is kinda scarce due to construction. 
"Beautiful, Sobering Tribute - Truly A Must See",October 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,mforkner,"My wife and I made a slight detour to view this memorial on a recent trip … hard to describe the memorial in words.  The statue is incredibly impactful.  The reproduced photos and descriptions of the horrible events that inspired this tribute are beyond sobering.  Cannot recommend this highly enough - traffic issues, delaying beach arrival, inconveniencing yourself a bit - whatever it takes is more than worth it.  This is definitely a MUST SEE item."
Very Moving ,October 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,510conniel,Beautiful monument to the horror of the Holocaust. Wall with names of those murdered in the Holocaust. A very tall sculpture of human figures reaching to the top of a helping hand. Worth seeing.
big and beautiful park,July 2014,50,Flamingo Park,Alexandra K,"the park is lovely, pretty, full of birds and animals. it is not just for kids or animal lovers, it is a pretty cool place to just walk around with a few friends, snap some pictures, feed a super friendly giraffe."
Green Space,October 2014,30,Flamingo Park,og84,"There is not much green space or unbuilt land in Miami Beach, this is more or less an oasis in the middle of the island.  There is still enough green to call it a park, although much of the land has been developed with various sports facilities, including a modest-sized baseball stadium.  There is some limited on street parking available.  You can walk here from Lincoln Road (multiple parking structures), its only about four blocks and one of them is very short.   "
Nice!,June 2015,40,Flamingo Park,JULIANP710,Very easy to get to
excellent conditions,June 2015,50,Flamingo Park,Borijay51,they have done a good job keeping the facilities in good conditions. the tennis courts are still top flight while the park remains clean. 
Gay paradise,January 2016,50,12th Street Beach,Ann J,Everyone welcomed. 
Beautiful beach,February 2016,50,12th Street Beach,Justin388,"Great beach!  Perfect weather, beautiful people.  The blue ocean water is so refreshing and this time of year a little cold."
My favorite beach in South Beach,February 2016,50,12th Street Beach,DeeDeeR57,This is my favorite beach in South Beach.  It's a fun crowd and everyone enjoys themselves.  It's mainly a gay beach but the crowd has straight people too like myself and my guy.  Had no issue going topless.
"Big and wide, kept clean, easy access from town",February 2016,40,12th Street Beach,Mike S,"As with all the beaches on the island, this is patrolled and well maintained. Clean and easy access to the water."
Beautiful beach,February 2016,40,12th Street Beach,715autumnm,We went to the beach in February and there were a good amount of people but not too crowded. The sand is nice and the water is beautiful. There is also a boardwalk to walk and explore.
Go!,December 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,KSH50,"Excellent contemporary art. Exhibits change often. You're charged for entrance, and parking, but it's well worth it."
Amazing Museum!,December 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Carol W,"The setting of this museum is worth a visit. The design is incredible. Brilliant! It is a contemporary wonder, so clever- magnificent place to showcase art! The building is an exhibit in itself!"
Nice museum.,December 2018,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,morrisk446,"I would consider this a modern art museum as opposed to a contemporary. They were showing an anniversary show and had some very nice pieces. Some classics like Stella, Badessari etc. and some more contemporary pieces. There are 2 large floors and it is well laid out. I found it to be a worthwhile experience. Allow an hour to two unless you're  eating there also. Nice location on the water. Admission is a steep $16, $12 for seniors."
Amazing experience! Thank you Brian!,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Vernon A,"Many thanks, from the UK, Vernon A"
Great experience ,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,869riccardov,"First time at The Lock and Load Museum and it will certainly not be my last! The instructor, Fabian, was a professional and he made the experience worth every penny from beginning to end. Each staff member was friendly and surpassed expectations. The variety machinery was impressive and I will be sure to return! "
So amazing!!,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,JamesAuld123,"The man who helped us was absolutely amazing, providing my sons and i with context of each weapon as well as ensuring our safety throughout the lesson with detailed training and safety briefings. We had so much fun. Our helper was named Fabian, a really knowledgeable guy who was great with our 2 boys. Would definitely recommend :)"
Amazing Experience ,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,hantunes1973,For sure we will return!
Saudi Arabia,July 2019,40,Lock & Load Museum,487bandara,The location and the parking is very good. 
Interesting!!! :-),January 2017,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),ASHW31,When I saw the name of the museum I was hesitant on going in however me and my husband gave it a go and actually liked it...at the end there's a video that I feel like should have been at the beginning...I liked the video so much it made me want to take another trip through the museum....good time passer for the curious! 
A very funny place to visit,January 2017,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),marc514,"It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but they have an old, but fun exhibit inside. All kinds of sexual pictures, art and statues. Have a few drinks before going and enjoy. "
It is NOT pornography,January 2017,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),kengoodbeans,"Plenty of merchandise for purchase and artifacts to view.  Don't judge by the exterior or strange entrance by elevator, it is worth the visit."
Great place!,March 2017,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),haroldm121,"The place is great. It's not very large and you can have the self guided tour completed in 45 minutes. There is a lot of art exposed, some of them really impressive. Recommended."
"Lovely beach, full of friendly and beautiful people!",November 2015,50,12th Street Beach,omgchampagne,"I really enjoyed the 12th Street Beach. It was relaxed, and the people were friendly (and beautiful). I didn't feel the need to constantly watch my valuables and people felt comfortable leaving their items and going in the water. The beach was bustling but not overly busy and it was easy to get a spot at lunch that wasn't on top of another sun worshipper. Great LGBT visibility, which is a plus for us when travelling."
nice place to visit,May 2015,40,12th Street Beach,T0urist7,If you like watching the surfers… I recommend the beach for kids. I found the beach quiet and clean.
Relax,November 2015,50,12th Street Beach,PSlowly,"Really just part of miles of sandy beach at Miami. Lie back, watch the fun and soak up the sun. Plenty of cheeky birds around. Watch kite flying in windy weather and light aircraft advertising."
The Gai Beach,December 2015,50,12th Street Beach,Robert G,The Tides Hotel is next door and has a more upscale menu but yet 3m from the Palace action.  Parking is tough as this is a very central area. Park the car.  Take UBER... walk or take a CitiBike.... 
Beautiful pristine beach,December 2015,50,12th Street Beach,dunnt508,"Very popular public beach suitable for all ages. Beautiful white sand and blue water. Tide and rip current can be strong at times. Observe all notices, warnings and recommendations regarding swimming. "
"If you are in Miami Beach, Why not....",March 2017,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),umbc24,Interesting display of all kinds of things.  Not sure what I was expecting but wow.  All kinds of art and sculptures.

First Basketball Game,March 2019,30,American Airlines Arena,Bkjjoanne,Nice arena but the staff was no where around to show us where our seats were and we ended up having to find them for ourselves.
"Safe, entertainment and clean",March 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,fmcarioca,"Very easy access, good for children, clean, with a good variety of things to eat and drink. Went to a NBA game, and it was amazing!"
Very Disappointed ,February 2019,20,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,877maggiel,Overall - very underwhelming experience :(
Planetarium is a must,February 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,izzygrantm,We came one afternoon and saw one of the shows in the planetarium. It was absolutely the highlight of this visit. Narrated by Liam Neeson it was very informative and captivating. The other exhibits were just as good and interactive. My friend wasn't keen on any of the aquarium as she said they were kept in too small a tanks and there was even the chance to handle a starfish which she thought was animal cruelty. If you go up to the top floor you get great views of Miami from both sides. Quite expensive for what it was.
Great planetarium- great museum,February 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Aimeehd,We had a 6 hour layover in Miami after reading reviews this was best suited to my 10 year olds interest.  We only brought backpacks and checked our luggage so we could enjoy the museum.  I’d recommend taking an Uber vs taxi as the cost is about half the price. Entrance fee was typical to other museums that also offer a planetarium show.  Timing wise we started with the planetarium and then worked our way up the floors.  We had lunch here on the patio the pizza and the tater tots were great!  We would recommend this museum to travelers.  There is something for everyone of all ages.
Get the membership,March 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,84denar,"I have visited the museum several times and always enjoy it. It’s very good for kids but also for adults. They also have different exhibitions throughout the year. I think the admission prices are expensive, and if you’re planning to visit more than once you should get the membership."
Poignant ,November 2018,40,Holocaust Memorial,elaineGbarnes,We stopped off here on a day trip.  Although it was physically smaller area than we had expected there was lots of information on the holocaust to remind or bring you up to speed on this shocking terribly sad part of history.  May we all never forget. 
nice time at beach.,October 2015,50,12th Street Beach,NAS789,"this is where i entered the beach. there are pathways onto the beach. we got lounge chairs included in the hotel charges, but needed to pay an extra $15 for an umbrella. make sure to use sunscreen and reapply, even with sunscreen and umbrella my daughter got a little burnt cause the sunscreen came off in the water. get there early for a chair closer to the water. "
Excellent ! ,September 2015,50,12th Street Beach,Isabelle P,Between 8th st and 12nd st you Will find the best place. If you want to be more quiet go to Tahiti beach which is a very nice place as well.
The world of diversity in one SoBe spot,September 2015,50,12th Street Beach,DrDanWest,"The whole world of diversity in one wide expanse of a beach. Typically the place where the gay and lesbian sun-worshippers hang out in SoBe. Busiest on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. In the event of a sudden downpour don't worry! The Palace Bar is only a minute away, on Ocean Drive, and welcomes everyone until the sun comes back out again."
BEACH!!!,September 2015,40,12th Street Beach,DoctorDisco,"Excellent beach, great water for wading, swimming, playing, etc.   The sands are clean, and plenty of room for beach-goers.  "
Turquoise goes well with white...,August 2015,40,12th Street Beach,JMRCB,"Just the same as the South Beach review really: 12th Street Beach was our closest beach from our apartment on Collins Ave. it harbours warm, turquoise waters and soft, white sand. It's easy to see why people rave about Miam - there's an innate tranquility here. The beach was clean, so it's obvious the locals take a lot of pride in keeping the area pristine. Beware of the cheeky prices for beach chair and umbrella hire. Not joking."
An important visit,November 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,Y0ssiY,I suggest to take a 15 minute walk there and not missing it.
So well done.,November 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,Janet S,"When we were at the (free) bottanical gardens, the phone kept telling us we were at The Holocaust Memorial, which turned out to be right around the corner. WOW. So gut wrenching and emotional. Bring tissues."
nice decoration for Hannukah,December 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,Friedrichv89,"in the middle of busy Lincoln Road stands this memorial for the 6 million killed Jews in Germany during WWII and should also talk to american conscience, as many of them could have been saved, if the would not have been rejected when they tried to immigrate to the US."
How skimpy is your bikini/speedos?,November 2015,50,12th Street Beach,antoinjstrachan,"I'm not one to shy away from a little bit of skin and it's certainly on show here at the 12th Street Beach. The ""body beautifuls"" come here not just to soak up the sun, but to soak up the atmosphere and get an eyeful of the other stunning people out at the beach. At certain times of the year there are party events and other performances here. When I'm in Miami Beach, you can be sure I'll be here in my speedos. "
Great people watching,May 2016,50,12th Street Beach,AshleyJPettygrove76,The beach offers great views of the ocean as well as the local color. It is a very interesting and varied crowd of people. 
Gorgeous,October 2015,50,12th Street Beach,CatherineCusak,"Beautiful beach, the water  is unbelievable, crystal clear and really sets off the clean white sand. I've travelled all over Spain and Greece and seen some incredible beaches but this place really is one of kind. Very clean, and an excellent spot for people watching the wonderfully eccentric visitors to and residents of Miami. All in a perfect place to spend an afternoon (or five minutes if you're Scottish like me and used to more arctic climates!)"
I WORKED AS A LIFEGUARD HERE IN THE 1960's !!!,June 2016,50,12th Street Beach,Frank d,"Boy do I have memories of this beach or what !!! I worked as a lifeguard here for a couple years before moving away to go to college in 1963. We lived on 13th street and Drexel Ave., just a couple blocks from here and spent most of my time here at this beach. This beach is better today than it ever was. It is much wider and better kept now that back when I lived here."
White sand,June 2016,50,12th Street Beach,59galtraveler,"A bit crowded but oh so pretty. Gorgeous beach, soft white sand, life guard and chairs for rent. Beautiful surf, warm waters, easy access."
quiet in the middle of South Beach,September 2014,50,Flamingo Park,viajerodenoche,"Always liked this well maintained park. Older well kept neighborhood, my aunt lives on the next block. Very relaxing"
sports in good localization,July 2015,40,Flamingo Park,gabistaut,"great place to play TENNIS,good localization in south beach,beautiful pool.worst thing:place to stop the car"
Get active!,July 2015,50,Flamingo Park,hyprsts,"If you live an active lifestyle, you'll be really happy to reside near Flamingo Park. Lap Pool for just US$10/pax., baseball stadium and soccer field. Wow!"
Miami Flamingo Park,August 2015,50,Flamingo Park,FAT G,"Very Well Maintained and Clean with all kinds of sports activities for Kids and adults alike, Miami is simply surprising!!!"
Go and walk!,September 2014,50,Flamingo Park,Estela_Edelle,Beautiful park in the middle of SoBe. Fantastic for running or walking or just enjoy the view of the amazing trees araound.
Worse stadium I have been to,August 2018,10,Marlins Park,Aida P,"Games here are boring, hardly anyone goes.  The food choices are sub-par and very expensive.  Stadium itself is tacky with that ridiculous home run sculpture which thankfully is going to be removed.   Traffic is horrible to get to the games, especially on a weekday."
Parking rates keeping me from visiting,December 2018,20,Perez Art Museum Miami,alvarop862,The outrageously expensive parking keeps me from renewing my membership. The site around the museum is magnificent. 
Wonderful option,December 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,juliob837,Great outdoor space for family and kids.
"Small for a museum, but good short visit",December 2018,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,thomasandersonn,"Definitely a very small museum with only a handful of galleries. However, the art is very interesting and provides a much needed distraction from the boring beach days, or gives you an alternative activity on a rainy and windy days in Miami. "
Great experience!,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Gabriel F,"We had an amazing experience at L&L. We were guided by Max who was fun and knowledgeable about all guns. Would definitely recommend it, specially with Max as a guide."
"Expensive, but great",July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Kristi S,"my son wanted to come here to shoot ""the big guns"".  The guide helped him learned proper gun care, kept him safe and helped him have a great time.  the full staff was friendly.   Definitely recommend"
Loads of fun,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,elisias2019,Had a blast. Our instructor was Will. He was extremely informative and explained everything in full detail. I was scared to shoot at first but he made me comfortable. 10/10 would definitely recommend.
Fabian is a fabulous instructor,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Chip D,Thank you
Great experience ,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,120charlie,"Loved every minute, would highly recommend."
Extraordinary,June 2016,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Irene D,Do not miss it! You will never see anything like it anywhere. Not for perverts but for people who are genuinely into art & history & doing something different.
Great chance to explore the world of eroticism throughout the ages.,April 2017,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),BlueCollarFoodCritic,"This collection by a nice old Jewish lady is a testament to the adage that sex never goes out of style. It, at times, goes on behind closed doors, closed eyes, closed minds, and even in the dark. But here, it is exposed for all to explore. Don't be embarrassed to go. After all, you wouldn't even be reading this if it wasn't for s-e-x....."
Out of the ordinary art museum,April 2017,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),sjp38501,"The front desk lady was very pleasant, commited to the  mission of the owner. Eroticism as an artistic expression. Not presented in a pornographic or sensationalistic way. Very nice pieces, my favorites Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimpt represented by nice works. Nice collection of antique and classic eros. Took almost two hours to tour. Very easy to find in South Beach."
Awesome place if you love Art.,April 2017,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),martinngina95,"Initially we were thinking the museum would've been full of pornography, and feeling a little prudish, I thought it will be too much to see all at once. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the detail in every piece of art the owner collected. It was really interesting to see sex culturally. The section on Japanese culture was especially eye opening; the women were expected to drop what ever they were doing to tend to their mates needs. Even if it meant doing it while feeding your child... that was gross, selfish and inconsiderate, but interesting nonetheless. They have some really funny pieces. The owner was someone you would never think would be into these things. You end up respecting her for her foresight by the time you leave. 15$ for entry for something out of the ordinary and only 2 blocks from south beach's entry way."
Worth a visit ,May 2017,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),91cz,"We enjoyed our visit , it was fun and no crowds . We spent about 1.5 hrs there , staff were very friendly and helpful "
Pleasantly suprised,March 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,Pataec,"For such a huge place and huge numbers of people, attending a HEAT game here was a pleasant surprise.  All attendants were helpful and polite and crowd control was done well.  Plenty of eating places once the arena opens (1 hr before the event) ...elevators and escalators available at different levels."
Travelzoo deal heat vs hornets ,March 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,beach020bum,"If you have any questions, please call us at 786-777-3865(DUNK)."
Miami Heat Games and Concerts,May 2018,50,American Airlines Arena,Scenic761937,"Excellent arena, really self close parking, can be a little price the drinks inside, but overall is a Great place to cheer your favorite team, in my case The Miami Heat!   "
We attended the basketball match between Miami Heats and Brooklyn Nets,November 2018,50,American Airlines Arena,Venicetripper,The place was grandiose and the match was exciting. I was amazed at the extent of the area before arriving at the actual Arena. In spite of the thousands of people present everyone moved swiftly to take their seats. I loved the atmosphere and will go back again for another match when next I visit Miami.
Great afternoon out,March 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,V5732RPtomm,"An architecturally interesting building in a lovely park setting overlooking the city.  I thought the ticket price was good value for the planetareum, aquarium and other interesting and informative displays.  The cafe is pretty basic, but fine for a light lunch or coffee break.  Getting there by the MMO from downtown was easy once you understood the loop system!"
Interesting Attraction for All Ages,March 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Peter T,"We have been interested in visiting this new science museum since it was under construction. A visit by our son's family, including grandchildren ages 4 years and 18 months provided the proper motivation. Quite literally, there is something here for everyone. A highlight was the ""River of Grass"", a multimedia experience aimed at children up to age 6. Both of the grandchildren were absolutely mesmerized; in fairness, the adults thought it was pretty neat as well. Another major attraction is the multi-faceted aquariums. While we spent several hours there, one (without easily distracted young children) could spend much more time there."
VeryGood for Children,March 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,dmhn,"The exhibits, planetarium and aquarium are interesting.  There were many hands on areas throughout this museum.  I believe children would find many exhibits interesting because of the interactive nature of them.  Some of the exhibits are set up so parents/grandparents can sit (and rest!) and watch while their children/grandchildren interact with the exhibits.  However, my wife and I felt that there was not much for adults to glean from the exhibits."
Daddy daughter time,April 2018,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Cleveland D,"Was a beautiful visit, we enjoyed all the interactive exhibits. Had a great learning experience. Will be visiting again soon."
Disappointed,February 2019,30,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,vapalacio1991,"I had been very hesitant about going here since it opened, I generally like Museums but for what ever reason I just had a gut feeling not to go. One day I just said lets see if I will be impressed by this place and I planed to spend at least half a day there, however after being there only 1 hour I was very bored and ready to leave. I categorize the layout as Kid Friendly, The exibits that house marine animals are nice but that was it for me. The menu in the cafeteria style eatery is very Generic, Pizza, Hot Dogs eat. Also the parking and entrance fee to the museum is very expensive. Not worth the price. I will Not be returning here."
Beautiful & Moving,November 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,BethT1990S,A very poignant and thought provoking memorial. Beautifully done. A great reminder of how lucky we all are.
Very Moving - A Must-See if You Visit Miami,December 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,Spike927,"This memorial is extremely tastefully done. The sculptures are incredibly life-like and realistic, and give a strong visual impact about what those poor people had to suffer. If you visit Miami please go. If you don’t intend to go to Miami you should go for this memorial alone."
Great reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust,January 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,west2926,We took our two older teenage children and am glad they had the opportunity to learn more about the atrocities of the Holocaust.  We walked to the memorial at night - glad it stayed open into the evening.  Just as impactful at night as it would have been during the day.
Impressive memorial,January 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,Mary S,Great activity away from the beach.  Real close to the convention center and the Botanical Gardens.  Details on the statues are amazing.  Highly recommend!
"Wonderful water, great sand...",August 2016,40,12th Street Beach,mshnaya,"Excellent sand well maintained and packed,  with wide vistas.  Small rollers coming in lapping up maybe 10, 20 feet of sand.  I was there about 7:30 in the morning when the maintenance tractor just rolled by.  Sunny blue skies with big puffs  of clouds.  I had to roll up my trousers to wade a bit in that water... wonderful, maybe 70 degrees?  Next time I must stay an extra day with leisure!"
Stayed Across from this Gem,October 2016,50,12th Street Beach,ChucknJoany,"Ashamed to say that for the first four days of our holiday apart from going to look at it once, we didn't spend any time on this beach even though we were staying just across the road, preferring to do tours. Then we started to spend time there and it is a great beach. The sand is beautiful, the sea can be rough, but there are lifeguard stations all along the beach, both restored art deco ones and modern ones so you feel quite safe. There are rental stations where you can rent chairs and beds but at a total of $55 per day - $20 per bed and $15 per umbrella - it makes sense unless you have money to burn or are just there for a day to buy the little chairs and umbrellas at Walgreens. We had these provided by our condo and can honestly say these are really comfortable. Everyone seemed comfortable enough to leave their valuables on the beach but we chose to buy some waterproof phone holders at a discount dept store and just popped our phones round our necks when we went into the water."
Sun and Fun,September 2016,40,12th Street Beach,risitodeplata,What can you say about the beach on south Beach. Wonderful. The beach at 12th street. There are chairs and umbrellas to rent. Food stands to get food.  And of course beautiful sand and the crystal clear warm waters of the beach.  This part of the beach can have a larger gay population but not always. Most times the water is completely calm and you can just stand in the water and relax. and of course the water is always warm. Of course you can walk up form the beach here to the Palace Bar and take in the Drag show that is always a big draw and entertaining.  There are showers as you leave the beach to wash off and bathroom at 10th street.  A good part of the beach to visit.
Beautiful Beach,November 2016,50,12th Street Beach,Rachel K,The water was a beautiful blue. There was a large beach so that you can be as near to or as far from the water as you would like.   There were also a lot of shells to collect. Beach was very clean.
Eye Candy,September 2016,50,12th Street Beach,peteivonne,Just an awesome beach.  Lots of people great sand and much eye candy. It's right in the middle of all the action on South Beach.
Great park for children and adults,December 2015,50,Flamingo Park,Jules B,"During our recent vacation, my wife and I took our children to the park frequently.  Our daughters, age 4.5 and 2.5, enjoyed the great variety of attractions in a fenced in location.  The grounds contain both soft surfaces and grass.  There are jungle gyms, climbing walls, and other attractions at a children's playground.  The other parents at the park included a good number of local parents and grandparents, as well as tourists.  While we did not get the chance, I was told that the public swimming pool is also very nice.  The park also contains numerous tennis courts, trails, and basketball courts.  "
Nice place to chill,October 2015,40,Flamingo Park,Dipendra K,I love going there once in a while and see basketball games. Also they have other games and activities too. I wish the park was bigger though.
Wonderful place but THE POOL IS CLOSED FOR A FEW MONTHS,January 2016,50,Flamingo Park,EcoCapri,"Everything about Flamingo Park is excellent... good staff, great facilities, safe and well lit... tennis, running track, dog parks, children's park... BUT the pool is closed indefinitely as of mid-January for repairs and we are told that the repairs may take 2-3 months. The next closest pool is Normandy pool about 30 minutes north of Flamingo. However once the pool reopens you can be sure that we will be there once again every day for laps and sun!"
Flamingo Park,January 2016,40,Flamingo Park,387indy,"Tropical with all kinds of trees, in fact it has shaded areas. The main theme is activities. The high light is the pool, which is under repair for the next month. For the kids you still have a fenced in area with climbing walls, and jungle gyms. There is a dog park. The Tennis courts and Basketball courts are very popular. The restrooms are clean."
"Beautiful Urban Park, Swimming & Tennis",February 2016,50,Flamingo Park,Kathy H,"Well groomed, conveniently located, Flamingo Park is a great place to play tennis on the hard-tru courts; they have tennis clinics daily for $25 pp for 1 1/2 hour session. Very nice locker room, tennis clothes and shoes for sale on site. The pool is good for lap swimming. Nice place to walk around."
Beautiful building with random quality art work,December 2018,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,mario g,If you have a Bank of America ATM card then entrance is free on the first Saturday 
Top Class!!,January 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,SueDen27,"We’ve been to many Modern Art Museums & always come away lost for words and confused about many of the exhibits. Clary, our Tour Guide’s introduction & explanations opened our eyes and minds in a way that will stay with us forever. We were so impressed-arriving at 11.30 & not leaving until 4.30pm!!!!   The Christo Film and exhibition was amazing. Thank you!"
Good For First Dates,January 2019,30,Perez Art Museum Miami,279annamaries," This falls into the category of ""trendy hip provocative"" which means it's great for adults who are either knowledgeable about contemporary art or are looking for something to spark conversation between themselves and a new acquaintance. With a $13 per adult admission it's not for the casual museum-goer.  If you are lucky tou'll spend 90 minutes looking at quirky art. No major masterpieces. "
"Fun Museum, Beautiful Surroundings ",February 2019,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,SofiaTorrinha,"The gardens and surrounding buildings look very beautiful, even though we were not able to see them perfectly since we only went there by night. There's a big parking lot and a nice restaurant. "
Great experience,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,London121212,What a great experience. Max gave us all the safety brief and guided us through the whole experience with great help and lots of information on each gun and how to use it. Great to experience actual automatic guns and the respect you need to give them . We will go again as best day out for ages 
Well worth the 2hr drive,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Timbo1984,"Took my 2 teenage Sons. The staff were friendly and very helpful, which makes the difference,nice area to sit down or look around the Museum while you wait on your turn on the range.Weapons Instructor Max was very helpful. look forward to returning again GOOD DRILLS !!"
Great time!,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,TheSurveyor2018,"This place is spectacular. It is completely safe and well supervised. This is something my 13 yr old grandson wanted to do, as did I. It isn't cheap but it is an incomparable experience; they provide a video of your shooting too! Absolutely unmissable! We had Will, and he made our experience there most memorable. You can pick from a wonderful selection of automatic weapons. It is interesting to learn all about each gun too! There is an excellent display of armament you can handle and take pics too! Casual dress/shorts are fine. Nothing loose like a necktie."
One-of-a-kind Experience!,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,AdamT0710,"I recommend closed toed shoes and a shirt that isn't too low cut since hot brass will be flying around and you don't want to burn yourself. Also note, handguns are NOT able to be rented while solo so be in a group if you want to try those out."
Amazing first shooting experience!,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Manuela L,"Brian was my shooting and arm trainer. He explained so many things, was super informative, friendly and had a lot of patirnce! Everyone at Lock & Load was so nice. I can only recommend it! Thanks for everything guts! You made my day!"
Interesting!,June 2017,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Nina B,This museum was very interesting! It was pretty intriguing to look at all of the ancient items from back in the 1900s. We learned a lot about the different types of art. It's worth a shot to check it out!
Very interesting Spot (no pun intended,June 2017,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Sherry P,"If you like unusual adventurous museums, this is a must see.  We spent about an hour walking through but could have stayed much longer. An amazing collection of sexual everything owned by a very interesting woman. "
Detailed and Dense Collection of Erotic Art,July 2017,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),rugby007,"Bottom line: I've been to a few sex museums in my day, and most are prurient and pull their customers due to shock value.  This place is exactly the opposite, very intelligent and tasteful, presented for the appreciative and mature.  This place is a winner, and am already looking forward to returning."
Incredible collection and a must see.....leave the kids on the beach,June 2017,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Matt M,What a great and interesting collection of everything from erotic art to soft porn. This collection gives you a million photo ops that aren't appropiate for FB...lol. Well worth the cost of admission and open later than most!
Just what the name says it is,July 2017,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),PeanutWellington,"Interesting to say the least - leave the kids behind though. The history of the curator is fascinating - one can not tell a book by its cover!! there are items from Shiele and Rembrandt to hugely phallic creations dating from the ancients to the moderns i.e. Clockwork Orange’s white sculpture. Take it as an interesting venture into how cultures represent their sexuality and goes what, its all the same!"
American airlines Arena,April 2018,40,American Airlines Arena,Travelexpt,"Catch a Heat game or any other event playing. Location is great in the heart of downtown Miami. Modern Arena with great seating. Parking at the bottom for members or across the street in empty lot. Also throughtout biscayne Blvd. The Arena is on the water overlooking the bay and next to Miamis bayside, and the frost museum of science and Perez arts museum. Food at the Arena can be pricey a beer with chicken renders and fries 35.00 - 45.00 parking another 25.00-30.00 you can also walk next door to bayside a dine in one of many restaurants also free live entertainment in the evening main entrance stage enjoy the game!"
Miami Heat v Orlando Magic ,March 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Dave-Elaine1989,Great experience (we loved this visit)
NBA Game,December 2018,40,American Airlines Arena,Islandexcursionsbvi,I visited this arena a few years ago with my daughter. We had a great time watching Dwayne Wade and Lebron play.
Miami Heat vs Dallas Mavericks,March 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,GasperExplorer,"This was my first NBA experience and it was amazing. The arena itself is huge, a bit bigger from what am I used to in Europe. The thing that also amazed me was the food selections which is far bigger than in Europe. You can see on the basketball court from any sector of the arena, even the most far away one. The only smaller complaint that I have is that the security screenings should be under the roof as well because when the gates opened the rain started to fall really hard so we all ended up being soaked a bit."
Great Science Interactive Museum ,April 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,218patriciav,Great to visit with the family. Lots of kids playing around while learning. All ages are welcome. The team is ready to explain all the questions you’ll have.
This place is fantastic!,April 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Milton_Annie,It's such a cool layout-- various buildings on each level and amazing views of Miami. Beautiful illustrations of aquatic creatures decorating the buildings...
Worth the pricey admission...but there are ways to save.,April 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Kdhancock,"Visited museum w/ 4 girls: 17, 15, 11.  All thoroughly enjoyed the various exhibits throughout the museum especially the marine life.  Parking was expensive: $8 1st hour, $4 after that (park at american airlines for $5 and walk the 2 blocks) or use public transportation.  Also Food@Science (the only dining on-site) was somewhat pricey and took 45-60 min.  Best to bring a bagged lunch and snacks.  We felt the free 25 min.  show on planets, sun and stars was just OK.  Tips: Check to see if your local museum has some sort of free admission reciprocation.  Save $2/ticket by buying tickets on-line the day before.  Skip the long line by buying same day tickets on-line anytime. If staying in Miami for a few days, by the city pass and get multiple attractions for one prices."
worth your time and $,April 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,lizmarodz,Good place to take your family.
It's...okay,April 2019,30,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,abigfish,"I think this museum is especially aimed at children, specifically the MeLab section, so its very interactive, but also almost everything is broken (understandable (?)). I think its a bit overpriced considering it's about $30 per person, and parking is like $20. The planetarium show is really nice, and the flight exhibits and aquarium are a good size and interesting."
Holocaust memorial,January 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,tasol2018,"Very poignant & heart wrenching but worth it. Little known even by locals but should be a must by all visitors to Miami. Amazing sculpture in itself but very informative display of facts on the holocaust. Take some time out of the usual sights for this one, you owe it to all those who lost their lives & to humanity in general."
Sobering,January 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,Wombling_Free_7548,The memorial is dramatic but tastefully done and very sobering. There is no charge for admission and we spent 15 minutes absorbing it. The tunnel down to the centre of the memorial is particularly effective.
Deeply Affecting -- Do Not Miss,January 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,ddaborn,"Understandably Miami Beach is a place where people go for fun or relaxation. However, while you are there, do not miss the Holocaust Memorial. It is an incredibly powerful and important presentation that is moving beyond words. On the walls, a history of the atrocities of the concentration camps is chronicled, and the statues evoke the emotion matching the horrors they reflect. There is no charge, and it is a block from the Botanical Garden (also free). In my opinion, everyone should make time to stop here and reflect on what was and can never be allowed to be again."
Very sobering memorial - worth visiting ,February 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,JeremyS588,Very moving sculpture and setting for this memorial to the Holocaust. Its scale and emotional impact put the apparent frivolity of Miami Beach into context. Very sobering. 
Great Beach and Surrounding Area,January 2017,50,12th Street Beach,Mary M,Walk the beach. Explore the Art Deco neighborhood. Gawk at the amazing cars new and old. Swim and sun and stroll.
White sand,January 2017,40,12th Street Beach,Usia2014,"Clean, white sandy beach with a unique back drop of Art Deco buildings. It was peaceful to relax by the water on a beautiful, sunny day."
Fantastic Beach..,March 2017,40,12th Street Beach,adrianlmarano,"Probably the most beautiful beach in town. Clear sand and water, nice people, beautiful landscape, is definitely a must, and for free!!!!."
"Warm days, cool nights",March 2017,50,12th Street Beach,Tammie P,The beach was family friendly and was nice to find a place to sit. It was three of us woman and I felt mostly safe because we sat near the life guards. 
"Nice, clean, good for children",April 2017,40,12th Street Beach,YvesMelis,"This is a very nice beach, where you can choose to either rent a bed and umbrella, or take something from your hotel. We were in the Leslie Hotel, which is at Ocean Drive and quite near. The water is warm, the waves are small but great to play in with the children. It's quite a long way to go before the water becomes deeper, so ideal to play with children. The beach is clean, the sand is soft and sea is blue... very enjoyable!"
Great neighborhood park,February 2016,40,Flamingo Park,DeeDeeR57,My guy and I stayed in an apartment nearby for vacation.  This is a great park to do walking and exercise.  There is a great track to either walk or run.  
A WOW in the middle of South Beach!,February 2016,40,Flamingo Park,miamisaks,"The pool is large, has a smaller pool for the young, and is very well kept, supervised, and attended"
Good and safe park.,April 2015,50,Flamingo Park,Paula_MIA,"Good vibes in this park, really close to all the facilities, is the oly place where you can chill in South beach if you don't want to spend time on the beach this is a great alternative."
Loved it!,March 2016,50,Flamingo Park,joyy74,"It was so much fun visiting the birds & animals. It was mating season for the peacocks, so it was very noisy also. We had a wonderful time and we will go back during our next visit to Miami."
Urban park,May 2015,40,Flamingo Park,PrestonGuild,"This is a nice urban park used mainly by locals but good to drop by just to people watch. It is not usually visited by tourists and we saw people at all hours playing basketball, jogging and keeping fit."
Superb Modern Art museum,February 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,busch2016,"This was one of the best modern art museums in the U.S.  The art was very thought-provoking and very well explained.  Many of the major artists had written information in both Spanish and English to take home.  The building itself is very modern, but the hanging gardens and the wood make it feel warm rather than the cold cement found in other art museums.  Food in the restaurant was also excellent.  "
"Good, but didn't seem to have the sparkle of previous visits",March 2019,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,Ian C,The other downside is the high cost of parking - $12 for 2 hours.
Absolutely fantastic,February 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,izzygrantm,A wide range of art from a wide range of artists. There is something for everyone here and I could easily spend hours here. I found a lot of it very thought provoking with some of the art based around Black History Month. They have a small shop and cafe round the back.
Some real interesting exhibits,February 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,dotcho,"Very varied exhibits which are designed to provoke The ""island wrapping"" feature from Christo was on display and that in it self was worth the trip.  ""All in the same boat"" makes you think.  There are guided tours available."
Fantastic experience,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Claire G,"We visited yesterday and wow, what an experience. Max was extremely polite, knowledgeable, funny and really helpful. Our 2 boys did the cadet package and I quote “the best thing ever!” . Husband did the special forces package. Absolutely amazing experience, throughly recommend"
awesome!!,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Riqco H,We visited lock & load on Monday this would be my second time going. Bought friends with me this time around. Max was our instructor and let me tell you he knows his firearms. I always feel nerves at first but once you get shooting it all goes away. shout out to the lock & loaded family from Bermuda!! we be back in the near future.
Simply great,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Addefreitas,Would definitly recommend it.
Happy Customer,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Timdoggg85,Overall a must visit for those who respect and appreciate fine machinery.
A great experience,August 2019,40,Lock & Load Museum,NikhilL17,We had a really nice experience at lock and load miami. Found it a tad bit expensive but enjoyed the experience. Max our instructor was very friendly and ensured that we had a safe and fun time while shooting!
Educational,September 2017,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),523jabeenr,"Very educational, warm and friendly welcome from the staff, will definitely recommend going if your around the area"
Amazing,September 2017,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),trina_lasmarias,"A stunning, fascinating collection of erotica. Lovely! Had a nice time walking through this cool little museum. Naomi Wilzig knows how to pick them. Would definitely recommend to anyone who isn't afraid of an artful display of human anatomy. "
Interesting ,October 2017,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),aeseay,"Fun and entertaining. Not everything has a description by it. If you have the time and it’s your thing, I’d drop by. It’s not very big, so it won’t take up your whole day. Only complaint is the building has an overwhelming mold/musty smell. Definitely hard on the sinuses. "
Fun and weird!,April 2017,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),LizDacko,A great thing do to off the beaten path - fascinating in both its contents and its own history. Open later than most museums and much more extensive than you would think - a little bit of everything and considering the content extremely tasteful!
Concerts & basketball ,May 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,StephenCr0ss,Located in an east to get to spot in Miami City. Public transport available. Great venue and home of the Miami Heat.
Convention ,February 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,corvette44,"Went here for our yearly convention in Feb, Market America, had a great time, we couldn't me here yearly,close to the restaurants in the area, walking distance. "
A+ Staff,June 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,CobaltConnection,"First time here. Attended a concert. Everyone involved was friendly and helpful.  Food and beverages were overpriced,  by tasty. "
The best Arena EVER!,January 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,angigima,I am a huge Heat fan and have been to 6 arenas in the States including American Airline arena in Miami. I think American Airline arena in Miami was the best arena I've ever been so far. Staffs were nice and it was easy to access. I was even able to take a photo with players!
Florence + The Machine 6/9/2019,June 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Stephen7Continents,Great venue - every seat is a good seat!
Everything was GREAT!,May 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,irbflyfish,"The parking was easy.  The museum of science has a zillion nice exhibits, most with parts my little grand children just loved (hands on).  The people we talked to that worked there were over the top nice.  From the museum to the cafe to the gift shop, everyone was great.  Even the view of the cruise ships on the ocean from the top floor was beautiful.  I cannot say enought nice things about this place and the good people who work there.  Take you little ones here, they will have a blast!"
Varied and well displayed,May 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Russel G,The variety of different things to see is great but the planetarium is really excellent. If we had had our grandchildren with us we could have spent all day there.
Lovely aquarium and excellent views,May 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,760yerayp,"Came here for three hours and thoroughly enjoyed the Aquarium with the variety of animals and special mention goes to the most amazing panoramic views of Miami, definitely worth visiting. You can even touch some of the animals!!"
Not worth the money and time,May 2019,20,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,krispark221,"We visited this attraction on a Friday morning. Many (Most!) of the exhibits, science experiments, displays, etc. are broken or don’t work properly. It also seemed very unclean. I find it ironic that there’s an exhibit here about microbes and bacteria yet they are lacking hand washing stations. The planetarium was the best part of the museum and you only get to pick one show to watch. It would have been nice just to go in and view the planetarium shows since the rest of the museum wasn’t worth our time. "
Worth a visit,March 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,NellyNelly1102,"The memorial is located in an easily accessible part of town. It was smaller than I had imagined, but it was beautiful. The sculptures were well-detailed and very moving. Staff was very friendly. Definitely worh going "
Holocaust Memorial,March 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,Glynda D,"This is one of the most heart-rending memorials I've ever seen. At close range, one can see the people clinging to the arm and the tatooed numbers on their arms are visable. It brought tears to my eyes and is a must-see when visiting Miami Beach because we must never forget!"
Moving reminder of horror,March 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,TAMAN1951,"Love the quote from Anne Frank “then in spite of everything, I still believe tahr people are still really good at heart.”"
Impressive,January 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,MiamiKeyWest,Overwhelming monument as a memorial for the 6M Jews that perished during the Holocaust. All these names ...
Powerful,February 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,grum99,Found this by accident and were very impressed. Combine with trip to Botanic Gardens. Hard to locate
The best beach,May 2017,50,12th Street Beach,142edwin,What I say simple the best time we stayed at the Washington park hotel so we had are own section of beach so we had are sun beds free all day  it's a amazing beach very clean a great place 
After work ,August 2017,50,12th Street Beach,cecilias822,"Nice, clean beach with every service. I don't think it is a gay beach. Personnel is very friendly and helpful."
Rainbow Beach,December 2016,40,12th Street Beach,LasSirenas,"Like a lot of things ( Hotels, Bars ,Restaurants, Bookstores etc ) this Beach is very gay and lesbian friendly.There are also Special Gay and Lesbian Partys during the year"
It's a beah,November 2017,50,12th Street Beach,Duncan C,"There is really nothing special about Miami beach,  it's a beach hanging on to the side of a huge city, fairly commercial with chairs and umbrellas for rent.  Crowd watching, however, is really interesting "
Huge Beautiful Beach,December 2017,50,12th Street Beach,Thomas V,"Great expansive beach, so great that it seldom seems crowded.  Huge amounts of sand and sea, great for taking the sun and swimming.  Easy access from the city."
"A good place to relax, exercise and unwind",June 2016,40,Flamingo Park,Nicolas B,"If you like to play tennis, basketball, outdoors, swimming, or just want to chill, this place will be good for you, the tennis courts are fairly new (clay), basketball courts well kept, open areas, you can practice any sport you like, as all the facilities are there, you just need some water and refreshment, as summer if pretty humid, specially if you go before 5 pm."
Kids & Families Will Love This Park!,June 2016,40,Flamingo Park,lmawright,"The park also has tennis courts, handball courts, basketball court, big dog and little dog fenced park, soccer and baseball field.  If nothing else a great place to sit under a tree to meditate or read a book."
Iconic Park,July 2016,50,Flamingo Park,central92016,"Just a great place to go for a game of baseball, basketball, tennis or simply running.  It is a beautifully landscaped urban retreat."
Best Park in Miami,August 2016,50,Flamingo Park,Twills138,"Words can not describe this park. It is so beautiful that you will not believe it's a park. They have a swimming pool for a small fee with lifeguards on duty. Handball,Tennis and Basketball Courts are surrounded by beautiful palm trees and benches for sitting and enjoy the breeze. Let's not forget our four legged friends. Two dog parks are on the property with easy access to all of the action. I will come again and have some fun when I visit Miami."
Local,October 2016,50,Flamingo Park,mario v,"this park is for locals pretty much, it has everything basketball,tennis,soccer, and baseball field and also a swimming pool. very big and good place to spend time with your family or pets, there's also parks for the little kids to play at."
Cruise days are busy days,December 2018,50,Port of Miami,RXPOPO,It is amazingly efficient given the number of people departing and arriving in a single day.
Nice ball park to visit,June 2019,50,Marlins Park,Love2travelthree,Parking was easy and the park is very clean and well laid out. The seats were pretty spacious and comfortable.
indoor baseball?,May 2019,40,Marlins Park,ccnsd,"I went to 3 games 2 with the roof open at night and one day game with the roof closed.It's a nice park, I ubered to the game they have a drop off and a pick up area. I sat 3 different locations and felt all the sight lines were good. as in all sports parks these day, parking (you can do it online and save $4), food, drinks expensive "
St. Louis/Marlins game,June 2019,50,Marlins Park,Dana H,"Very nice stadium.  Fans friendly.  Felt very safe, police had roads blocked for easy access to the stadium.  Nice and cool with the roof closed."
Not even worth the parking fee,March 2019,10,Perez Art Museum Miami,Suzygs,"There was the seemingly obligatory mirror image geometric painting in two colors and the painting of straight colored lines, both of which almost anyone could have painted. I think the artists on display had become famous somehow in the past, and now are able to create something facile and call it art. I thought this was a waste of time.  The parking lot is shared with the Frost Science Museum, a much better use of your time and money."
A facility in search of a collection,March 2019,10,Perez Art Museum Miami,Vzzg,When I went back to the Wolfsohnian Museum on Miami Beach after the Pérez it was a relief to see their stellar collection of deco and modern work and it’s surehanded curating. Visit the Wolfsohnian instead.
Rainy Day event,March 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Esther T,Last minute plans changes and Museum  did not disappoint. The entire place is wonderful and engaging. A bit on the small side but great.
Avant-Garde Provocative Collections,March 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Paralee5,"I love this museum! If you enjoy modern provocative diverse art then the Perez calls your name! In addition they offer multimedia and visual sensory exhibitions such as short films and light shows. Also the exhibitions reflect the Miami community with Cuban, Haitian and South American influences! "
World class museum,March 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,SongBird212,"Do yourself a favor and GO to the Pérez Museum! Fantastic art! World class collection.  Fun and educational for children, teens and adults. This would also make a wonderful date. The restaurant is also delicious. I loved visiting and will come back!"
Celebrated Our 30th Anniversary with a BANG,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,jagug2013,"My husband and I celebrated 30th wedding anniversary at Lock and Load Miami and it was AMAZING!  L&LM was easy to find, parking was convenient and we were greeted with smiling faces.  We were both first time shooters, so we had no idea how it worked.  The manager assisted us right away, showed the packages, gave no pressure to buy or upgrade our packages and because it was a special occasions, we each also received a special add on to our packages.  I had the 007 package and my husband had the Special Forces Eastern Bloc package. Will was our instructor, he covered with detail all safety matters, proper handling, it was well balanced....not rushed or dragging on. . Will was ex-military, his knowledge and professionalism made us feel secure.  He gave us step by step instructions on how to load and fire and then we proceeded on our own. It was a JAW-DROPPING experience and an adventure we will never forget. "
Amazing,August 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Geordie1975,This place is amazing and we loved every minute..bought a t shirt as well
Amazing experience,September 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Lu1sprieto,"My instructor Fabian was very calm and focus the whole time and able to answer any questions while still having fun on the job, and the guns were great to shoot if your new to this like I was this is the place to start"
What a experience!!! ,September 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,raftintin,"We had absolutely blast with ""scarface pack"". Fabian was great and get us thru all guns history we were shooting. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Miami. Thank you again Fabian. "
interesting but somewhat amateurish,December 2017,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),yvonnefuentes,"Interesting pieces and worth the visit, but the organization and layout needs some professional curating. Pieces are placed too high so it's hard to see and impossible to read the information cards. Organization is also somewhat confusing - by era, places, chronology, topics, media..."
Bizzare,December 2017,10,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Stephen G,Not  worth the high price of admissions. Strange assortment of items. Most have to labels or explanations.
"Different, but not worth $15 administration price",December 2017,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Michael A,"I doubt anyone these days is shocked by displays of erotic art. Whilst I see some cultural merit in the museum, the ticket price is too high. I recommend skipping World Erotic Art Museum."
Ehhh....,January 2018,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),GeorgiaQueenB,Not sure what I was expecting but this was probably not it. It definitely had a lot to see--rooms of it. Lots of artifacts and pictures and bizarre sex things. Some were very interesting and some I wasn't sure why they factored in the museum. It was all kind of hodge-podge in there and at times I felt like I was in an antique store or warehouse. It's worth a gander if you like erotica....but don't expect to learn a lot.
"Good collection , but not worth the $20 admission",February 2018,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),LiliRueda,The ‘museum’ is a collection of articles. I was expecting more than just collected pieces. They should charge less for entrance. 
J Lo Concert,July 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,Maria A,"A great night, wonderful show. She is a wonderful entertainer and the Arena was packed. But very organized, we had great seats smack in the middle.."
A must for a basketball player!,December 2018,40,American Airlines Arena,EDLTraveller,"This is a great place to visit if you're a basketball fan, especially for teenagers. Exciting! And if the weather is decent, you can walk there from the Bayside Marketplace."
"Miami Heat Game, THE BEST!!!!!",August 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Myaussielife8,"The best basketball games in the world!!!! Flames, music, hosted by an enthusiastic and charismatic speaker, the best cheerleaders and choreographies ever, the public!!!! Amazing spectacular  We loved it!!!! The merchandising team was kind and lovely and we ended buying the Miami Heat art deco t-shirts for all of us!"
Concert goer,August 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Anibal Z,Place was good and had tons of food stands. The only issue was parking so get there in time or Uber it and you will be fine.
Great Afternoon at the Frost Museum,June 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Ponch84,"A fantastic family outing on a rainy South Florida weekend. The price of admission is not too expensive and if you are a resident of Miami-Dade County, there's a cheaper add-on as well. We had a wonderful time with our children. The museum and aquarium are well worth it, and the IMAX theater had an excellent variety of films staggered throughout the day."
Scam. Expensive and not worth the money at all.,July 2019,10,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,vanessapillar1990,"The aquarium is nice, and that's All. The entrance is $60 dollars and you get nothing out of it. There are 4 floors full of nonsense expositions so in the end if you want to pay $60 dollars to see an aquarium, go ahead and be happy. I expected MUCH more considering this exorbitant price. But... I guess it's Miami quality?"
An architectural wonder but seriously lacking in visitor engagement and exhibit interpretation,July 2019,30,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Ramón M,"I should preface this review with a disclosure that I grew up in Miami during the 1970s and 1980s, and so my review may be tinged by a sentimental attachment to the old Miami Museum of Science and Space Transit Planetarium. Notwithstanding my love for the old museum, its undeniable that the Frost is a world class facility and a major architectural upgrade. My teenage daughter and I had a pleasant enough time there, and we learned a couple of things about the earth's climate and materials science. It was also gratfiying to see the place full of young summer campers, scampering around and interacting with the hands-on exhibits. The Frost has done a good job of making its exhibits fun and accessible to the younger set. The aquarium, with its signature ""Oculus""  is marvelous, and the view from the 6th floor observation deck is breathtaking (I'll have more to say about the observation deck in a minute). However, the experience overall left me feeling as if important elements of a world class science museum experience were missing. Namely, almost no staff were assigned to engage visitors and provide interpretation. During our three-hour visit, we were engaged by only one staff member who was tending to a species classification pop-up.  Over the course of three hours, I saw no other staff tending to pop-ups or otherwise providing any type of exhibit interpretation. Meanwhile, we were approached by two staff members trying to get us to take goofy photos for sale. This is not, in my opinion, an optimum use of human resources in a science museum. A second source of disappointment has to do with some of the programming that the old museum strove, in its modest way, to provide that the new museum does not. Namely, the old museum had a broader mandate to display exhibits on the cultural anthropology of South Florida and the peoples that inhabited the region. This is completely missing from the new museum. This gap is a missed opportunity to connect the new museum to the place it resides in and the indigenous people who inhabited the very spot the facility sits on. The gaps in science coverage at the Frost felt more and more glaring the longer I ambled through its four buildings. Zoology and evolutionary science, genomics, meteorology, geology, physics--where were they?  Even the tiny selection of planetarium shows was a disappointment. And perhaps here is were my sentimentality really weighs in. The old Museum of Science and Space Transit Planetarium was one of the leading US institutions in providing astronomy outreach to the public. We cannot bring back the great Jack Horkheimer, but there is no shortage of outstanding educators who could have been hired to restore the Frost's former glory days of astronomy outreach,  that is--if the facility had been equipped with an outreach observatory. As I walked the perimeter of the expansive 6th floor observation deck, surveying all the empty space up there and the broad horizons, I thought of what could have been. Downtown Miami may be as light polluted as you can get, but light pollution has no effect on views of the moon, the planets, and double stars. Even a modest outreach observatory--like the one the old museum had--would have been a great resource for the community and a fine opportunity for public engagement. Hopefully, the Frost's finances will allow for consideration of an observatory as a future add-on."
Amazing place!,July 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,895ericaa,"The museum is awesome, super organized and staff is very kind and helpful. The kids loved it!!! It is definitely worth visiting the museum."
Frost Museum of Science,July 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,387indy,"Beautiful architecture, great facilities, super modern, planetarium, museum and aquarium. They have a very good staff, I enjoyed all four floors."
Very moving,June 2018,50,Holocaust Memorial,wiffy0,We stumbled upon this memorial when we were wandering around looking for a supermarket and it happened to be on the way. It's very impressive and the area around it with all the sculptures of people in various situations were very poignant. The music playing on the way to the centre of the memorial really sets the scene/mood and it's very moving when you reach the scene inside. It's heat breaking to think what people went through and this memorial definitely gives you a good insight into that. 
Nicely done,April 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,715autumnm,I noticed the sculpture from the road. It's a beautiful memorial. Nicely done to pay respect. Check it out 
Spend Some Time Here,February 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,skypilot38,"This is a very moving and beautiful sight. It is worth spending some time here, recollecting on the tragedy of the holocaust and the ability of humans to treat each other horribly. Excelelnt informative panels located outside."
Very impressive and very moving tribute,April 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,JohnnieC1966,"A very impressive and incredibly poignant tribute to the 6 million Jews who lost their lives in WWII. Make sure you actually go inside, and read all the story boards and see the figures at the bottom of the main sculpture. Everyone should come here to be reminded of the lessons from the past."
Not to be forgotten,May 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,StephenCr0ss,It’s absolutely fantastic and really moving. It’s stark and a real reminder of the horrific tragedy that occurred.
Lovely Beach!,January 2018,40,12th Street Beach,Dandelion516,"Great view, very clean for an urban beach. The bathroom is nearby - but the one at the Starbucks is closer. Buy something and get the code of the day. Lots of gulls - and they can be aggressive. "
Beautiful Stretch Of Beach,December 2017,50,12th Street Beach,TinaW22,We found this stretch of beach close to our hotel to be perfectly located with lots of places nearby to eat and drink!

Nice beach with lifeguard station,February 2018,40,12th Street Beach,John M,Water was too cold for me to go in (Feb). Many others went in.Nice beach with facilities. No seaweed on this visit.
Predominantly Gay Area of South Beach,March 2018,50,12th Street Beach,TitaniumMonkey,"A lovely section of south Beach where the gay men tend to congregate so predominantly males.  Here and the beach sections either side are where you are more likely to encounter the ""racier"" swimwear of both male and female.  It is a popular section so can get quite busy even on a weekday."
Falmingo Park,May 2016,40,Flamingo Park,buddhakouri,It is a very good park to go to. It has its own public pool. It is one of the parks North of Fifth Street in South Beach. 
"Swimming, workout and tennis",January 2017,40,Flamingo Park,Jack M,"Numerous activities to choose from...quite a few tennis courts, large swimming pool and an area dedicated to working out.  Worth visiting!"

Park ?,February 2017,20,Flamingo Park,JohnT01Traveler,Skip it. Lots of construction going on around it too
Flamingo Park,February 2017,40,Flamingo Park,Henrik A R,"This is a great recration area. With a nice park, water park, playground for kids and tennis. The bathroom facilities at the water park could need some refurbishment. But the small kids loved it. Easy to park just nearby."
Art Deco.,February 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,684adrianh,Worth visiting.

Surprising South Beach find--best deal in town!,March 2019,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,TJouer,"Tip: I would recommend you pay the $5 museum entrance fee. There is a nice, indoor, restroom only available to museum clients."
MUST BE YOUR 1ST STOP WHEN YOU ARRIVE,March 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Charles D,"Well ... maybe not your first stop, since you'll likely need to check-in your hotel first.  Your second stop, however, upon arriving in South Beach certainly should be the Art Deco Welcome Center!  If you are as lucky as my wife and I were when we visited the Art Deco Welcome Center (yes, it was our second stop), Danielle will be working at the information desk.  She is worth her weight in gold.  A vast library of useful information, Danielle gave us a fantastic ""lay of the land,"" recommending excellent restaurants, tours, stores, and transportation options, as well as a explanation of how the various neighborhoods comprising South Beach are laid out.  While visiting South Beach, make stopping by the Art Deco Welcome Center a very early, high priority on your to-do list.  It is well worth the time and please tell Danielle ""Hello"" for us!"
Easy access from Beach and friendly staff,April 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,worlds2wanderer,Enthusiastic staffers are great at sharing tour ideas and providing directions. Regualr tours start at this local. There's a gift shop and drinks available for purchase too.
The best one ,February 2019,50,Port of Miami,957tamiz,"One of the most busy US ports. Miami is a capital of cruising industry and the port of Miami is one of the most efficient one I’ve seen. On some days as many as 52 thousands guests go through the port embarking/disembarking their vacation. The traffic can get a little rough between 10 and 1pm, but everybody working very fast and efficient"
⚾️ MARLIN’S WIN⚾️⚾️⚾️,June 2019,50,Marlins Park,04sunshine,Great family fun and good bang for our buck that night.
Great Hangout Spot!,June 2019,50,Marlins Park,MrD305,I love the way that they updated the food service and seating/standing areas. Fans deserve to have such options.
Ballpark tour,June 2019,40,Marlins Park,djanchondo,"It was Nicaraguan hertitage night when we went to Marlins Park. It made for a great atmosphere and the game was  great (4-3 win over the Pirates). The firework show at the end of the game was great! The Grand Finale is by far the best I've seen at any firework show at any ballpark/event. Visit the bobblehead museum! Concessions weren't all that great, but being in Little Havana, you can definitely find some great food surrounding the stadium. This is not a knock on  the stadium, but Uber and Lyft have got to get better drivers to pick you up after the game. So many frustrated people who kept getting their rides cancelled after minutes of waiting. Drivers could not seem to understand where to pick up their riders. Just a heads up if you're using those companies. There isn't a bad seat in this stadium so sit wherever and enjoy a pretty personal stadium."
Cool MLB Park,May 2019,50,Marlins Park,Lee P,"Went on a Cuban Heritage night.  The ticket prices were very reasonable compared to some other parks.  The sightlines were great from our seats.  The stadim itself is quite an amazing piece of architecture compared to our home park (Rogers Centre).  Overall, a great Friday night out!"
With My Girl,June 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,yourhelpfulfoodie,"This museum it is so beautiful, modern, complete and impeccable. Their staff are very attentive and willing to give you all the information and indications you need. They are very organized and most of them are bilingual. They have variety of exhibitions and they offer tours to get more information on them. PAMM is good for all ages and when I went they even had a school field trip.  This museum also has a restaurant which I can't wait to go to. On Thursdays night they have happy hours with DJ. See you soon on a Thursday PAMM!!!"
Your overall appreciation level may depend on special exhibit on view,April 2019,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,scott r,"Archtecturally interesting museum with a nice natural setting & gardens, near people mover.  Pleasant place to relax in and of itself.  I thoughly enjoyed the vist, but much of that may have been the Beatriz Gonzalez retrospective.  Not just her art but the history & politics behind it.  There are other rotating exhibits; one almost feels the permenant collection must be small - until you read otherwise.  This is not a showstopper museum where you get lost for several hours, but you do (again perhaps depending on what's on offer) leave satisfied after perhaps 2 hours."
Excellent architecture and some nice art work,April 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,TandTSwitzerland,Finally Miami gets more interesting for museum lovers!
Art museum in bay front park,July 2018,30,Perez Art Museum Miami,Travelexpt,"To me the museum is to modern. After visiting other great museums around the world this one rates at the lower end for my taste.  However,  there is a day out of the month that admission is free. If you happen to be in Miami I believe it's the first or last Thursday of the month. You can visit for free and make your own judgment.  I prefer the frost  museum of science next to this one. With a planetarium.  The museum is on the water with great view of the port of Miami and its cruise ships. There is also a cafe with out side sitting over looking the water live entertainment on weekends at night."
Pleasant visit (but a bit expensive),April 2019,30,Perez Art Museum Miami,David S,"Enjoyed the exhibits here, but found it to be expensive for the two hours time spent.  We had lunch at the cafe outdoors, which was pleasant but also very pricey for the quality of food.  "
Awesome Experience!!!,September 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Magdiel M,Had a Team Building event here and everyone loved it. Brian and Will took their time to explain everything in detail. Have to check out the museum as well!
Went in on a whim and thoroughly enjoyed it,July 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,DannG266,"The little museum is interesting in itself, but once you've looked around, you kinda want to try the firearms. We did the cheapest package, which is still $100+ each, but worth it if you've never done anything like this before. It's a truly unique experience and it all felt very safe. I was a little nervous, but was put at ease by Fabian, who talked us through everything, guided us and was generally super helpful and friendly throughout. We got to keep our targets too and a got little something extra, which I'll leave as a surprise. Really great experience, would definitely recommend."
Looking for something to do? ,November 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,chrismhamel,The Hamel’s from Maine. 
Great resource and gift shop,November 2018,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,Claire D,"This is a great place to find out more about the history of Art Deco conservation and revival in South Miami Beach. They organize tours and you can buy a nice map with self-guided tour. Great gift shop. Only downside, no tours on Thansgiving day. "
Enjoyed it!,November 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Edward S,Enjoyed talking to Beverly about tours and places of interests.  She saved us time and money with her recommendations.
Soooo Helpful!!,November 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Chillmyway,Also it is important to check out these kinds of centres in places you visit since often Google and Travel Books will not offer the full details that an actual person living in an area can tell you. 
a must-do: art deco area,December 2018,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,HELUIN,This was a very good experience to discover an interesting area. Audioguides provide a good overview of technics and hotels which survive since 1920
"Great place, recommended!",October 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Daniel Grendal B,Great service! Awesome place with amazing guns! Good help with both picking the weapons and shooting with them
Adrenalin rush to make your heart beat,October 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,paljano,Really worth a stop if your in the area!
"Clumsy Display of Kitschy, Tasteless Objects",March 2018,20,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),mjsheridan130,"I feel I must state that in no way would I consider myself a prude, nor and I rating this place badly because I was somehow shocked or offended. However, I had high expectations when we paid $18 to enter that simply were not met. There is no rhyme or reason for where objects are placed. Sometimes the museum tried to place them based on type of medium, or culture, or time period, but overall it made very little curatorial sense. There were hardly any signs about anything so in general I had no idea what anything was. There were far too many objects on display leading to a cultured warehouse look, and the museum itself had a terrible flow of rooms with dingy lighting (if the lights were even working at all). Furthermore, while there were some excellent examples of art, including works by Rembrandt and relics from Ancient Greece, many pieces were tacky pieces of Kitsch that honestly have very little business calling themselves art. Other museums do a much better job of telling the story of Erotica in Art, so this one can definitely be skipped."
Education,April 2018,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),janneramstedt,The only thing i missed was that sometimes there was no information at all about some of the art. Overall it was a fun experience and really interesting 
Checked off my bucket list,March 2018,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),TISH_A_MOM,"So, we arrived about 30 minutes before closing.  It is a musty building.  There was no one else there.  An interesting museum :-)  When we came downstairs the staff had already left and the lights were off -- weird"
A tasteless waste of time and money,April 2018,10,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),pnwtoc,"Total waste of my time and money.  I don’t know what I was expecting, but it was all pretty dumb.  IMO nothing in this museum was sexy or erotic.  Just brash in-your-face full nudity mixed with strangeness.  Maybe that’s your thing.  If so, go.  But most of it’s pretty weird.  Regardless, $20 per person is WAY too much for what you get here.  I totally agree with the other reviewer that I am nowhere near a prude, but the stuff is all pretty tasteless.  Many things aren’t “art” at all."
Bachelorette Trip!,May 2018,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),SugarSL,"Myself and a group of 4 other ladies visited the muesuem maybe with our hopes up way too high. The gentlemen at the front desk that sold the tickets was really nice and welcoming. The enterance fee was $20 USD, you then have the option of going up the stairs or elevator to where the muesuem begins. We started off walking from exhibit to exihibit and there were mostly very old school erotica pictures. There were some erotic statues and pieces but not as many as they made it out to be. It’s definitely an experience, but I wouldn’t pay $20 for this muesuem at all."
Huge and beautiful landmark!,October 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Boris M,Went to check out the American Airlines arena at evening. It was already dark and the arena was lighten up. It looked amazing. Really loved it's design and some architectural solutions. Well done Miami!
LOVED IT!,February 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Taomg4,"This may not be fair, but I love going and watching the Heat. A basketball game can be just the pick me up you need to continue enjoying the energy of Miami. "
NBA GAME,October 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Thiago G,Try to reconcile your trip to Miami with a game day.
Visit for a Miami Heat game. It's awesome!,October 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Riplis,The food is not healthy and a bit pricey. I would recommend eating before you get to the game and just go for beer and popcorn while there.
One of the earliest museums.,June 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,Sunshine34500,"no matter how many times you visit. Different take away each time. Very poignant, heart wrenching, but a Must See of iconic history. All True!!!"
Simply a Must!,August 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,RobTangeman,"If you've got an hour to spare head here, shell out $5 and learn a lot.  We enjoyed the small museum and accompanying gift shop.  It really opened our eyes to the different styles of architecture we were taking for granted before.  Miami Beach has done a great job of differentiating itself from so many other places by preserving lots from this period.  Highly recommend!"
Art Deco Guided Tour,August 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,664grahamef,We found The Art Deco Preservation League on Ocean Drive very easily. They provided all of the information that we needed to join a very informative and entertaining tour that wove history and culture through architecture; this in large due to the guidance of long time resident Julie. Happily the admission includes the Museum and Gift Shop and goes to pay for the work of MDPL. 
Walking art deco tour,August 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,tanak2018,Great walking tour with Julie. Highly knowledgeable and able to adjust tour when rain started. Definitely recommend. 
A very good point of call if in Miami,November 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Stella-Dot,"These people are passionate about their city, and rightly so.  They offer advice, information and plenty of good ideas about the art deco side of Miami.  The admission price is very reasonable for the tour, which also includes the museum.  You are treated to local knowledge and history.  The gift shop is extremely good and there is no pressure to buy.  Well worth a visit."
planning our days,August 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,judykitzmantiedke,friendly staff lots of information about different things to see or do while vacationing in the area. has a gift shop next door.
Incredibly moving ,June 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,S0lway,"Have visited many holocaust museums and memorials, in Israel, Amsterdam, Berlin etc and they are all different. This one doesn’t leave much to the imagination. It’s quite brutal, but meantime very moving and atmospheric. It’s beautifully laid out in a nice setting, and gives you time to process as you walk through. I would say an unmissable stop in a visit to Miami"
Impressive!,June 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,Linda v,"A nice, quiet place to contemplate and remember the holocaust. Statues are very impressive. I’m glad I’ve paid a visit."
A Moving Experience,May 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,RRaposoMiami,"A small, yet moving memorial to the holocaust. Located just a couple of blocks north of Lincoln Road and by the Convention Center. Incredibly torturous statues surround the main sculpture of a huge arm with its hand reaching for the sky as hundreds of bodies cling to it in agony. The wall surrounding is filled with thousands of names, as well as many photos and writing in the circular plant covered walkway. The tunnel that leads to the main central area is very moving. I've visited holocaust memorials and museums in Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris; while some might be larger, this one is special on its own. Visit if you're anywhere near if only for a few minutes."
Such a touching display!!,July 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,amyw0630,"I went to see this, not knowing too much about the memorial itself. I’ve always known about the Holocaust but to see this memorial up close and learn in detail about what these families had went through and the millions of lives lost, their names written on the walls, made it such an overwhelming experience.....one I won’t soon forget!! If you have a chance, stop by and see for yourself!"
What a waste of time and money,August 2019,10,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,robin123lb,I’m guessing they got rid of the old Museum because it was in that valuable south of Brickell area and no doubt it will soon be shops restaurants and more condominiums - what a pity.
Miami vacay,August 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,soul_fullady,My family and I had a great time at the Museum. There was a wealth of knowledge to take in for every member of the family. My daughter enjoyed building the avatar and planet planetarium.A must visit when traveling with your kids in Miami. Was definitely worth it.
"What a great place to visit an excellent Science Museum in USA without having to travel to Washington , DC",July 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,SergioR2013,"Having lived in the Washington area for many years, I am used to great museums (and free). We took 4 grand-kids (ages 8-18; 2 of them from Washington, DC) to the museum to show them around Miami. What a great place to visit! This is a first class institution and very nicely designed to enjoy the great exhibits and show and in an excellent architectural-worthy building. For those living in or visiting the Miami area, this Science Museum is excellent and a great way to spend a few hours without having to travel to Washington, DC. Highly recommended. The views of the exciting Miami downtown architecture and the Miami Beach skyline and bay views are also worth spending some time while visiting"
Fun for kids!,August 2019,30,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,WencyB,"It has a planetarium, aquarium and interactive displays for little kids. But not much exhibits for older kids so my son got bored quickly. He only enjoyed the aquarium and the view on the 4th floor."
Field trip with the grandkids!,August 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Jackie M,"My husband and I took our two grand daughters to the Frost Museum and we all had a terrific time. The girls (6) and (3) loved the interactive attractions throughout the museum, they enjoyed seeing the live animals like birds, alligators, snakes, turtles, sharks, beautiful aquariums filled with colorful fish. They got to touch sting rays, sea urchins and starfish. They loved the area of building bridges and buildings. They loved playing with the water exhibits and didn't want to leave the lighted musical dance floor. Our day was filled with laughter and fun and we even learned some lessons along the way. I would definitely recommend this museum for children under the age of 12. I bought the annual membership!"
Enjoyment!,July 2017,50,12th Street Beach,anth0ny540,This was by far the best scenic view I ever experienced.  The ocean was perfect and the amenities were right at my fingertips.
The 12th Street Beach is very beautiful.,August 2018,50,12th Street Beach,beatrizvs2017,"The 12th Street Beach was very scenic and we had a marvelous day with the family. If you walk 1 block down to 11th street- it is a side street between Collins and Washington Ave- you go to a local liquor store ""Tuto's Liquors"" at 211 11th Street on Miami Beach and be able to buy sodas/waters, wine coolers, beers, rum, tequila, or other and meet some real friendly locals. We bought liquor and sodas and the prices were very good and affordable. The onderful beach, some drinks, and a beautiful day.. what else is needed.   "
Some Practical Tour Info,April 2018,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,SigEpGov,"The tour is great if you want to learn about the Art Deco period. But, I’ll let the other folks tell you about the tour. Here is some practical information. The welcome Center is located at 10th and Ocean Drive. Parking on the street is random and hard to find, though there may be easier parking on Washington. Nothing is free, you will pay a general meter wherever you park and put the ticket on your dash. There are good parking garages around but I suggest you Google search your options ahead of time. I parked at Washington and 7th for $4 for 5.5 hours. The tour costs $25 and includes the Art Deco Museum.....there are senior (age 65+ and children rates). The museum is not much to get excited about but it gives you something to do while you wait for the 10:30 AM departure. Plus, the clean bathrooms are a bonus. They are prompt so give yourself time, 10:30 comes and they are off! No announcement is made in the museum, just the small lobby. The walk is 90 minutes almost completely outdoors, a mile walking and no place to sit. If you have problems walking, not only is this tour not for you, but seeing anything in South Beach isn’t for you. You must walk everywhere. It will get hot, bring water and be thankful this tour is in the morning. There will be a couple stops where you do get inside and it’s a little cooler.  Guides expect (oh I mean they say they accept) tips. They are volunteers, $5 per family is fine if you choose to tip. Stop into the gift shop before you leave. Some unusual items for sale.  "
Excellent advice for using limited time...Ask for Beverly!,April 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Desmond C,Hope this helps!
A wonderful resource,February 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,stowtraveller,"The people who work here are knowledgeable and very helpful and welcoming.  Basically, you have three choices for a tour of the fabulous Art Deco buildings of South Beach:  on your own with a printed guide, an audio tour, or a guided tour.   I wish we could’ve done the latter, but our rushed schedule did not permit.  Instead we chose the audio guide.  Again we were very rushed, only having about 45 minutes for a tour that should be an hour and a half or so; there were bunch of buildings we didn’t have time to go into, etc.   I really regret this, and would do it differently if I had the chance, as for me, the Art Deco buildings are one of the two things I absolutely wanted to see in Miami (the other being Vizcaya).   There’s a great deal to learn about the various design styles.  The hotels and other buildings — there’s even a post office! — are fabulous and beautifully preserved, thanks to a groups of locals such as the Miami Design Preservation League who’ve worked hard to see that they’re maintained.  This is an absolutely unique area which is well worth your while to visit!"
Excellent First Class Service ,April 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,L_Shaw66,"Thank you Beverly for a first class, professional service."
"Ocean Drive, Miami Beach",April 2018,30,Art Deco Welcome Center,nwaynesworld,"Very convenient location. The visitor information centre is located on Ocean Drive opposite 10th Street. The building is very nice. They have some good information. However, the service was lacklustre. Unusual for a visitor information centre."
One of the most beautiful beaches in the US,February 2018,50,12th Street Beach,Motherofchildren,What more could you want? 
Not sure why this gets separate recognition.....,September 2018,30,12th Street Beach,differentname,"It is basically same old, same old all the way down the beach fronting Lummus Beach Park and Beach.... the sand is the same, the degree of the water being not-that-inviting does not change till you get to South Pointe Park...  and viewed from space, you wouldn't be able to find it."
local gem !,September 2018,50,12th Street Beach,Daniela H,"Love this location because it is kind of a locals gem, or so I would like to think so. there is not that much tourist around and there is always space to choose where you want to lay and enjoy the sun and beach"
The Best,August 2017,50,Flamingo Park,bygpete,"Any type of ball can be played at the Park. Fantastic location, safe and secure. Grew up 2 blocks from the Park. Love it."
where is the flamingos??,November 2017,20,Flamingo Park,T0bias77,"Totally disappointed, just courts, basket, tennis, soccer, baseball..But I just wanted to watch some flamingos.."
Nice place for everyone,December 2017,50,Flamingo Park,travelbugmac,"We ventured off the strip and on our way back found this park. They have plenty to do for a kid plus basketball courts, tennis courts, and bars to work out. Pretty big."
Warm wanderings in Flamingo Park,January 2018,30,Flamingo Park,garysU5371ZU,walk the loop and back.
LOVELY FRIENDLY PARK,January 2018,50,Flamingo Park,Rifky K,"This park has a long wonderful history. It is the place where all the kids would meet,ride their bikes, swim, take tennis lessons, play football and just hang out. It did not matter what color or religion you were everyone played together. Today it is still a wonderful place to hang out and relax. The grounds are lovely and it is in the heart of south beach. If you want to stroll it is a wonderful place to just relax"
Great advice and amazing tours.,June 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Chris L,We strolled down the beautiful waterfront and stumbled across the beautiful Art Deco Welcome Centre. On entering we were met by the wonderful Betsy whom had an amazing amount of knowledge about the local area and gave us some amazing tips on places to go and things to see. It really made our holiday much more enjoyable. The tour is also amazing and ideal for those whom love Art Deco design and architecture.
Very helpful ladies :),June 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,KatarinaH027,"Thank you very much to all 3 workers we met when we went to the visitor center. Thanks for the information, explanations and phone calls! You helped us in our trip in Florida :)"
"Small, but interesting.",June 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,272edwinag,You want to see this and purchase the tickets along with the walking tour.  Helping educate about this area makes it well worth the price.
"Go there, you won't regret it ",July 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,loukaz_oz,"If you have the chance to chat with Betsy, use it. She has lots of knowledge on the place :)"
Informative,November 2017,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,Dunnersfireman64,Good location and had plenty of information of attractions / art deco buildings in the surrounding area.
Really friendly and helpful staff,February 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Janet E,This was the meeting point for the art deco tour. The tour was very informative and great fun. The guide really enjoyed his job. Definitely worth taking.
Stop Here First,February 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Tom Z,"This is a must for new visitors to South Beach. Beverly gave us recommendations that made this a vacation to remember. Stop here first and save yourself money and a lot of guesswork. This is a real Welcome Center with suggestions about tours, transporttion, and how to get the most out of your South Beach vacation."
Great Information and Funky Shop,February 2018,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,skaterarty,Stumbled upon this location while walking Ocean Drive. Picked up lots of great pamphlets and browsed through the shop. Definitely a must do when you arrive in South Beach. Very friendly and helpful staff.
Head right here.,February 2018,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,mrsagf,"Your walking tour ticket includes admission to their offbeat but interesting Art Deco museum. Without the ticket, you can still take advantage of the restrooms, purchase bottled water and get general tourist info."
So much knowledge!,May 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,glamourpuss1000,A good starting point for your visit to South Beach.
Why Are They Yelling At Me?,March 2019,20,Port of Miami,purplehorse13,Just drove up to Terminal B. While driving up to unload out luggage five different porters were yelling five different directions. And believe me on this - they don’t move your luggage to the ship till they receive their tip! Unpleasant way to start a cruise
Horrid Location,July 2019,10,Marlins Park,Adam W,I am not questing the stadium itself but when the Marlins use to play Pro Player stadium there were a lot more fans. Example the St Louis Cardinals triple A in Jupiter sells more tickets than the Marlins. They made a huge mistake moving the team all the way down in Miami because the majority of the paying ticket holders were from Palm Beach County so put on an extra 30 minutes of driving. They should of moved the stadium closer north than south like in Pompano Beach. Yet who wants drive from WPB or Delray just to go to a bad part of Miami just to watch the Marlins? It's the location not the stadium. Move the stadium further north and your fan base will grow
GREAT Venue but Food/Beverages are EXPENSIVE,July 2019,50,Marlins Park,JimParkland,"The stadium is really fabulous.  Can't imagine there's a bad seat!  You can also walk around the entire stadium (360 degrees) on Level 1. Beware though, hot dogs are $8, can of beer is $12."
Dirtiest Bathrooms on Earth,July 2019,30,Marlins Park,312cristinaf,"The stadium is great, we had a great time watching the Marlins win. But... THE BATHROOMS WERE EXTREMELY DIRTY! Toilets did not flush, at least they did have water and soap to wash our hands. "
Great Stadium,July 2019,50,Marlins Park,fitzstacy,"The stadium was really nice.  It was clean.  Ticket prices were very reasonable!  Food was a bit pricey.  Parking was easy, finding our way back to the highway not as easy. Too bad there is not a bigger fan base to support the team."
Marlins Park,July 2019,50,Marlins Park,Laurell R,"The fans are very enthusiastic and the park was great, it is too bad more of Maimi doesn't support the team. We had a great time, appreciated the dome due to the heat and loved the fact the ceiling was grey and not white, like in Tampa, as the ball is lost in the white ceiling. We really enjoyed the game and the crowd and don't understand why baseball isn't supported by the locals more."
Good option to go with kids,June 2019,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,edithg157,"This is one of the museums that you can visit for free taking advantage of the museum program that have the libraries at Miami Dade. The place is beautiful, attractive and you can enjoy a great view of Miami. You can make it in two hours. I could not see any presentation in the theatre. We had a table in the restaurant for lunch but we left after waiting for ten minutes and nobody paid attention to us. The parking is expensive but you can park in a public parking close to Biscayne Boulevard and walk. There is an special event for kids one Saturday a month."
Art and a view...,April 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,FloridaMG,Miami's premier art space.  Not an impressive permanent collection but some great temporary exhibits and one of the best views of the intracoastal waterway.  The building itself is a beautiful work of architecture.  Do not miss the café area and relax just watching the downtown skyline and the cruise ships.
"Very nice museum, right by the bay",July 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Manny A,"You have to take in the whole building and property as a whole, not just the art inside. The gardens and sculptures outside the building are impressive and make some very nice photo ops right by the bay. Inside you will see some very impressive and not so impressive art. Frankly I probably wouldn't hang 90% of the pieces in my home but still very fun to look at and figure out ""why is this in a museum??"". Take your time and watch the films also. Afterwards enjoy a nice meal in the restaurant under the ""hanging gardens"", very good food!!"
Free museum Saturday 2nd,July 2019,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,cocob843,"The museum is free only Saturday 2nd of each month. It’s an opportunity to discover this ! Guided visit are available at different hours. It’s possible to walk around the museum alone if you want. Caution, the museum don’t accept big bag and camera (only smartphone!)"
Going Back in Time,October 2017,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,Antalyaman,"A fascinating exhibition of furniture, stories, clothing and history of the area. Some interesting recollections. A pity the video wasn't working."
Guided walking tour! A Must Do!,November 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,5Helen5,"Thank you, Preservation League, and thank you, Paula!  Bravo!"
A TOTAL MUST ON OCEAN DR,November 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Lizzy9663,"This has to be the best ever gift shop and vintage store .... everything south beach and Art Deco is here. It is at the visitors centre on ocean dr. You can spend a good hour wandering through the store and looking at all the retro items and new items they offer. I bought a fantastic poster to frame and a fantastic sun hat both very reasonably priced. $12 & $34 respectively. The beautiful young lady helping us was Karen. Thanks Karen for your help, cheerful disposition and charming smile. It was so much fun visiting here on our self guided walking tour of the Art Deco district. "
An absolute must!,November 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,iyamwadiyam,"Great staff, super helpful and extrememly knowledgable. Next time would hop on a guided tour."
Tour de force,November 2017,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,Alnis,"We took a very good 90 minute tour of the Art Deco area, preceeded by a few minutes at the exhibition in the Center and followed by a shrt visit to the excellent tourist shop the next morning."
Amazing fun!!!,October 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,TheCulinaryDiva,Fabian was a fantastic ranger that made my birthday even better!  The entire team could not have been nicer. I highly recommend firing of the AMERICA package of machine guns. It will make your heart rate go up with joy!!!
Guns!,October 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,scotthank,Super fun shooting the older guns!  Brian was very knowledgeable and friendly.  I have never seen such a wide collection of guns!
Have a fun and great Experience,October 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,sundeepvarma,Thank you Lock &  Museum
"Fun, but overpriced!",October 2019,40,Lock & Load Museum,Riplis,All in all a fun experience if you have some cash to burn!.
Arguably the best of my trip,October 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Benjarocha,Such a fun experience. @Fabian was such a pro and nice guy. He even told me the stories behind each gun. Loved it
Excelent! Beautiful pictures and sculptures,March 2018,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),CeciHast,I separate one hour for the tour but I end up staying more cause there are so many interesting stuff from all over the world. I did the tour from room to room and at the end I came back to look once again for the one´s I like the most.
A Unique Experience Like No Other! (Have an open mind),February 2018,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),SeekTheBest,This is an experience indeed and one we will enjoy over and over.
Quite disturbing,September 2018,20,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),saphirasstory,"My friends really wanted to visit this place. It is definitely something different, but I didn't like it too much. You should go here when you are very open-minded and want to experience something new. The statues and paintings are very interesting, but to me some of them were quite disturbing as well. Not my cup of tea and in my opinion overpriced for what you get to see."
A bit small,October 2018,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),MichaelMc777,"The collection is good. But, I found the one floor of exhibits to be rather limited. It is nicely arranged and well done. The price is high for the limited items on display. "
"Erotic, humorous, and intriguing ",December 2018,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Thebigunodos,"This museum has many different types of artwork that you wouldn't normally find in a museum. As others have posted, keep an open mind. There are many artistic portrayals of the human body in numerous positions. My only complaint is that it feels like it could be laid out better. It doesn't flow well as you are walking through it."
Highlight of our holiday,October 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,philb33,They could just do with a bigger merchandise store. 
Art Deco at its finest!,September 2016,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Candy_Florida_Girl,"It's truly Miami! How could you NOT want to do this tour and meet people in the process?! Art Deco is simply fabulous and you need to partake in it as you wander around Miami Beach and absorb the colors, the architecture and the grandeur of these amazing buildings and sites! The people are amazing and so helpful and its a great way to see the City!"
Good place for an unusual gift,August 2017,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,annettefromm,The welcome center is both a small exhibit space and a shop. The shop specializes in Miami Beach memorabilia and art deco themed stuff.  Prices are pretty mixed.
Lovely self guided tour,August 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,R S,"It was super hot (98° F) and we were on scooters, yet managed to have fun. Plan for August sun if walking in the day time. "
Good local info',August 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,moosetoo,"My wife likes Art Deco architecture so this was a must-do. The displays and posters are well arranged and the docent was friendly and informative. She and my wife had a good conversation about places to dance in Miami too! If you want to know why Ocean Drive looks as it does, a visit to this Center is worth it."
Excellent!,September 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,zakajd,"Paid 20$ and was the only one who came. So my self guided tour transformed into personal tour. Rick was very good guide. Showed a lot of interesting places not only on Ocean drive, but also on Collins avenue. Highly recommend this tours to everyone who is interested in Art deco, history of Miami beach and architecture"
Miami Heat basket ball arena,October 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,sollyazar,The team is not so great but seems to at last have a young and interesting team . We were spoiled with the Lebaron Wade Bosh years . The place to bring your touriste friends 
They have a huge Miami heat shop on site.,December 2018,40,American Airlines Arena,staajabuatravel,Wasn't a game day when we were there but the staff allowed were friendly. Located near downtown and easily accessible by the city trams.
Full of life,November 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,lliek,"One of the “must see” areas in Miami , a place full fun and young people. Offer a wide variety of options. Nice even to stay out and chat with your friends, meeting new people after a sport competition. Nice experience for those who love to chat talking about sport and other activities. Highly recommend. Nice stuff members also active and available for any questions. "
Enchanting and terrifyingly beautiful,August 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,ReneeSaliba,"I think the most terrifying part was when we walked behind it and the music that was playing, the lighting used for the images below the monument, combined it scared us and we didn't even go under it. now I laugh but at this moment I was saying to myself ""they did a very good job at making this place feel like a memorial, a cemetery and for all it stands for"".  "
It's a hidden gem,June 2019,30,Holocaust Memorial,Mdefil23,This is a beautiful hidden gem but very sad. It might be overwhelming for those impacted by the past.
Amazing,August 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,melindacolon,"I have visited this memorial many times and can say that it is well done. The sculptures are amazing, the music playing when walking down the hallway into where the hand is, it’s very emotional. It is a great place to take your kids and learn about the Holocaust. Also it’s free!"
Clickbain in real life,September 2019,10,Holocaust Memorial,krampus-lab,"This is not a holocaust memorial, this is a hebrew memorial, and should be called like that. There was no mention of any other victims races / religions / beliefs / orientations. Double standards much?"
Chance encounter,September 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,Isla H,Came across this by accident and so glad I went in for a look. This is a truly beautiful place and so moving. I found it very peaceful but seeing all these names almost had me in tears. The sculptures are wonderful too and add to the poignancy . A fitting tribute to the millions who paid the ultimate price.
Nice experience ,August 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,felipecandia,Very good museum with great animals! The price to enter the museum $29.00 for adults which also includes free admission to a cool show. If you like aquariums you should definitely visit.
So Dissapointing!,July 2019,10,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,bbirch33,"We took a group of school chilren from West Palm Beach to the museum on July 25, 2019. Our group was so dissapointed in the whole museum. The ""hand-on"" activities were either broken or didn't work properly. The aquarium was so poorly lit that we couldn't see more than 15 feet and the water looked murky, nothing like the billboards and advertisments. They have all small unimpressive animals. Then because of bad weather the kids couldn't do any of the rooftop activities, like pet the stinkrays. This is South Florida! Why would you make outdoor activities based on weather. Also, most of the lunch seating is outside and since it was pouring, well you get the picture. We were very unhappy with our visit. It was just not you would expect from a museum with this kind of adversting in the middle of downtown Miami."
Surprised by the science museum in miami -,August 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Mmt91,I think the only one missing is a restaurant in the building where u can rest. :) this way u can be fresh for saving more information and not getting tired to much.
interesting fun visit,March 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,traveller8198,be nice. Went nuts at gift shop next door great assortment of Art Deco items. 
'Feeling Ignored at the Welcome Center',April 2017,20,Art Deco Welcome Center,Achimmah,"Wow, if these folks are the 'Welcome Ambassadors' for Miami Beach, just pass on by. Two employees and not a peep. Minimal literature and absolutely no energy from the staff. If this is what it is like on a Tuesday at 3 PM, I can only speculate what it is like on a Friday at 3 PM. There is some sort of exhibit that they want you to pay $5.00 to enter but, given what we experienced in that building, we took a pass. I would suggest that you dedicate your time to something that might actually be interesting or beneficial in ANY  way. "
Creative accessories and materials,March 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,SIBELBELMA B,"I always find something to buy here. There are creative, interesting designed mousepads to necklaces, silk scarves to paintings...."
Small but charming,April 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Rita L,The museum is both educational and pleasurable venue. Wish I had more time to explore it more and read all the information. We also took a walk-in tour. 
Art Deco Walking Tour,April 2017,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Patricia768,"Recently undertook an evening 90 minute walking tour around the Art Deco area of Miami. Our guide was Rick, and he was amazing- very enthusiastic, a bit irreverent- loved that, and his passion for and knowledge of the architecture and area was catching! We loved it. We were in a group of mainly older people some of whom had trouble keeping up and one of who kept asking for restaurant recommendations - Rick managed it all superbly- would do it again in a heartbeat if we return to Miami Beach."
Whole family loved it here.,August 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,usapa,"5 of us including kids aged 6, 9, and 17 loved it here. We spent about 3 hours, but we wished we could stay bit longer. We arrived little after 10am on Monday and it was not crowded.  "
Science in Miami !,July 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,David B,The 3 Level Aquarium is so unique compared to other aquariums - since the underneath view is so different than other aquariums.  Our son spent a good amount of time just admiring the many types of fish.  The Exhibits feature South Florida Nature at its best.  The Planetaruim is great for all ages...come and enjoy and family day with a bonus of great coastal and city views from the 4th Floor!
It's a beach,January 2019,30,12th Street Beach,photocpin,"What can you say?  Sand, water, it's a beach.  Price gouging chair and umbrella prices plus snacks.  The beach guy was very friendly and helpful though."
"Beautiful big, wide ocean beach",January 2019,40,12th Street Beach,PaulAK2011,"We were walking the length of South Beach from about 1st  to about 15th.   On the way north , we decided to walk barefoot along the water edge and enjoy the ocean waves and water,   The beach  was lovely, wide and spacious.   It was also fairly clean.   The old fashioned life guard station made an interesting photo op with the Miami Beach higher hotels in the background.   There were nice shower water stations to wash the sand off ones feet before going back onto the Ocean Drive."
Gay Beach in the art deco district,February 2019,50,12th Street Beach,Rob Z,"If you need you can rent towels, lying chairs and umbrella."
Majority alternative lifestyle,February 2019,40,12th Street Beach,Dana C,"If you are not offended with alternative lifestyle this part of the whole beautiful south beach area seems to attract that lifestyle more than other parts of the beach.  There is a beautiful hotel, ""The Tides"" that looks over this are and has telescopes in most of the oceanfront rooms.  We enjoyed ourselves while there."
Wide & flat beach ,April 2019,50,12th Street Beach,StephenCr0ss,What a wonderful stretch of flat sandy beach. Great area and really close to most of the hotels. Recommended. 
Flamingo overload ,April 2018,50,Flamingo Park,s-pestic,What a treat. Take the tram around the park and the drivers commentary is excellent. After the tram ride take a walk through the park where you will see Peacocks and other birds roaming free. The highlight was the flamingo enclosure where they come right up to the fence to greet you. Incredible. There are all manner of birds and animals. The food is really good on site but beware of the pesky birds who like to steal your food. A must do attraction.
Pleasant afternoon,May 2018,40,Flamingo Park,elle337,It's a lovely place to while away the hours. I like the fact that it's a rescue centre. You can see many different birds. We were chased and screamed at by a peacock as we stupidly took a picture and the flash went off. The otters were in their element using their slide and diving into the water. The bear was asleep and the panther only came to the glass when she heard the sound of children which was bizarre. 
Flamingo park is a good place to spend time.,August 2018,50,Flamingo Park,beatrizvs2017,"Flamingo park has lots of fun things to do: there is a pool, tennis courts, racquet ball areas, basketball court, baseball field, a running track, and a children's playground which has slides, tunnels, rock climbing, etc. We sat on the bench while the children ran around and played. there was a breeze and plenty of shade to enjoy a soda while we discuss where to go for lunch. The children had so much fun at Flamingo Park that we spent 3 hours and did not even notice the time go by. "
NO FLAMINGOS!,August 2018,40,Flamingo Park,traveltrackers,"Wonderful sports park,; tennis Go on line for schedule),tournaments, baseball, walking. I remember when the beautiful trees were small. See the rich and famous.Serina and sister practiced here in their beginning. Se the forthcoming players."
"No, there are no flamingos here...",August 2018,40,Flamingo Park,356lenniel,"A great outdoor arena for running, playing tennis and swimming. If you’re visiting, you can rent rackets at the center. "
The best tourist information in town,August 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,markdobson,"The best tourist information in town. Fantastic visitor centre right in heart of Ocean Drive. Lovely exhibitions on art deco Miami and home to the brilliant art deco walking tours. Excellent and really well informed residents as staff who also advise on other where to go, what to do, trips and sell tickets - we got our Big Bus tickets here. Also has a very cool shop which is probably (and sadly) the last place standing in this part of South Beach to buy an interesting card or imaginative souvenir."
Art Deco welcome center,September 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Brigitte W,Betsy was super helpful and so friendly! She helped answer our questions about what to do while visiting and even suggested her local faves!
Lots to see and buy,September 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,cher57,They also do tours of the Art Deco District
Very helpful! ,October 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Lorijean1958,"Staff was very helpful and professional! I only had a few hours to spend in Miami Beach and they mapped out the highlights for me. Next time, I will stay longer! Plus, the one dollar water at the gift shop ( which is donated to Art Deco historic preservation) is a plus! "
"Great team, great museum, great tours, great Team...",July 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,BilgeSonmezer,Thanks to all of them.
Cruise terminal (Royal Caribbean),March 2019,50,Port of Miami,Jordon H,"Pro tip: take a taxi. There is a flat rate from the airport (Miami) to the port of $27. To take a chartered bus by the cruise company (we were on royal Caribbean) was $16 per person. Coming off the ship, there is a huge line of taxis. Again, flat rate of $27. Save yourself the hassle and take a taxi."
Great venue ,August 2019,50,Marlins Park,Jackman1,Once you navigate the side streets and traffic you safe at home. $20 for regular parking. Dozens of food options at ballpark prices although if you look you can find a$3 dog and $5 beer. It’s air conditioned and a comfortable stadium 
Lovely ball park!,August 2019,40,Marlins Park,AlleyKat_8,"What a nice ball park! Great view of downtown, new, clean and bright. Can find inexpensive food, although it is small servings."
AN  UNUSUAL  NIGHT  AT  THE  BALLPARK,August 2019,30,Marlins Park,sommers400,"      Being  used  to  the  open,  comfortable  environment  afforded  to  fans  at  Citizens  Bank  Park  in  Phila.,  this  place  was MUCH  more  like  a  fortress  than  a ballpark.  Yes,  I  am  sending  a  ""  constructive  criticism ""  letter  to  Marlins  management........Additionally,  buy your  parking  passes  BEFORE  getting  to  the  ballpark.  The Marlins  gouge  you  for  an  additional  $  5.00  ($ 25.00  in  total)  to  park  if  you  pay  night  of  game).   I  am  glad  we  went,  but  won't  go  sprinting  back  to  Marlins  Park  any  time  soon."
Interesting venue,August 2019,30,Marlins Park,kathleenlS8568XU,"Cons: food- despite reading about the efforts to bring Miami to the stadium, I found the food options lacking and sparse. I have celiac and there was no dedicated gluten free food stand, like many parks, or readily accessible information. It also seemed like ice cream was sold in only one stand. Entering- you enter at field level and have to walk up ramps to get to the main concourse level. At 6 months pregnant I was not prepared for this and there seemed to be no other option, at least from the gate we entered. I was exhausted in the Miami heat after essentially climbing two/ three stories. "
great experience,May 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,AnaMarga13,"I enjoyed my visit to this museum, you'll find enticing international art collections on display, one of my favorites was the ""for those in peril on the sea"" by Hew Locke. Bright and airy building with an outdoor park, museum sits on the water with a spacious terrace where you can sit, watch the ships, while you sip an iced tea or any beverage of your liking. "
Admire the beautiful exterior; skip the museum,August 2019,20,Perez Art Museum Miami,zoobee14,"I REALLY wanted to love this museum, but honestly I can't give a recommendation to visit.  Outside, the building itself is gorgeous with the hanging gardens, views of the water, and great architecture.  Parking was very easy and shaded (obviously, as it is underground).  However, the art itself was lacking.  My initial impression was that the majority of pieces chosen for exhibition were perhaps from budding middle and high school programs in the area -which would be fantastic if it were offset with more quality pieces.  However, I've seen better collections housed in universities and even boutique hotels throughout the US.  Perhaps we visited the Perez during an 'off' season."
Miami,August 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,KECatalane,Stayed at the AC Hotel at Miami Beach. Beautiful and great service. Only 1 minute walk across the street to the beach. Washington Ave (or ot might be street) is a great spot for dinner and walking and shopping. A 30 minute walk along the beautiful beach to get there or down the street or a 10 minute bike ride. Lots of good food and people watching. Went on a food tour in little Havana and rode jet skins. Awesome trip  cant wait to go back!
Art on Saturday's,July 2019,40,Perez Art Museum Miami,KriticL,"Since its inauguration I did not have the opportunity to visit the PAMM Museum. I went with a group of friends to see an exhibit from Beatriz Gonzalez, a Colombian artist. Great retrospective!! We also went on the second saturday of the month and it happened to be free. So, make sure you go on a Saturday, no lines, light crowd and the museum always has something to show. Spaces are large. Nice to walk around, a wonderful art store and a great restaurant where we had a delicious variety of plates. Underground parking is convenient and affordable. Definitely a nice museum to visit."
Worst art in Miami,September 2019,10,Perez Art Museum Miami,skinnertilt,"Travelling to Miami I was very impressed with its iconic art galleries and districts, with the great exception of the Perez museum. The art itself was childish and soulless and the exhibits (the ones that were open) were lazily curated. For such a impressive space the museum itself was just another commercial trap. If you are looking for art in Miami do yourself a favour and visit Margulies Collection at the Warehouse."
Great Experience!,November 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,edeamorim,"The showroom/museum is impressive, with a large variety of assault riffles. They offer multiple shooting experience packages. I went with the ""Scarface"" Package which includes 4 different weapons for a total of 85 rounds (90 minute experience for a group of 5). Our instructor, Fabian, made the whole experience even better by giving us a brief history of the weapons we were shooting + tricks to improve curacy. Awesome experience, thank you L&L Miami!"
Great,November 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,1804c,I had a great experience at Lock & Load I learned a lot of things I didn’t know from my instructor Fabian and it was my birthday I got to fire the BARRETT M95.
A great experience and staff very helpful,August 2019,40,Lock & Load Museum,donkeysharp,"I shot before during my army service in my country, but bow I was able to shoot different weapons that are not available in my country and the Instructor Fabian (who served the US Army) gave me a good explanation about the weapons I shot thinking in safety on the first place. I really recommend it."
A MUST GO!,November 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,CatherineA1461,"If you are in need of great stress relief or just want to live out a dream of firing off some exotic weapons, this is the place! They also have a collection of guns in the museum you won't find anywhere else, AND some are available to purchase....for the right price."
Machine Gun Experience,November 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Diogo C,"Really nice people, good prices and a big thanks do will for showing me how to shoot for the first time!"
OK but not that exciting,March 2019,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Dave41707,"This museum has an eclectic and odd blend ranging from ordinary nude paintings to bizarre, somewhat grotesque erotic art to everything in between.  It’s a relatively small collection - won’t take you more than 20-30 minutes.  It’s $20, which is an ok value for what you get. "
Worth checking out,March 2019,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),summerslacking,The collection in about 25 min. It was open to 10pm on weeknights and photos are allowed without flash.
Not the average museum...,March 2019,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Leslie M,We found it extremely fun and hilarious to visit this museum. Tons of unexpected art from BC to modern day. The collection was impressive and something you won't see anywhere else!
Interesting Museum,May 2018,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),KristinR505,"I love art. This art just happened to be all about sexuality. There were some really beautiful pieces, some humorous pieces and some really obnoxious pieces. Walking through the museum gave me many feelings. I was very amused but the current exhibit was not at all uncomfortable. I have been to the Sex Museum in NY and WEAM was mild in comparison. I still very much enjoyed the experience though. If you want to do something a little different on South Beach, I recommend this to take up a little over an hour if you like to spend a couple moments with a piece. There are some interesting photo opportunities as well."
Random visit,April 2019,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),ryanm321,Was at bar across street saw they were open still and decided what the hell check it out. Was actually very interesting. Gave a great understanding to sex over the years and decades and different societies interests and interpretations of sexuality. Very well out together collection and what better location than south beach for a museum of its kind. If you have interest in the human sexuality and want a nice break from the heat check it out. Stroll thru at your own pace.
Huge Disappointment,November 2019,20,Zoo Miami,littleone1118,"This has to be the worst zoo we've ever visited!  After paying $25pp admission, you absolutely must splurge on the Safari Cycle ($26 for 2 hours for a small cart) or there is no way you're going to make it thru the entire zoo.  Sadly, we were unaware of this and there is no other location to rent the cycles except at the front gate.  There is minimal signage and the map stinks.  So forget trying to navigate to any particular place at any particular time.  We literally could not find the bear exhibit until the presentation was over!  The exhibits are spaced so far apart and half the Africa loop has absolutely nothing to see.  Then half the animals on the Asian loop are African animals!!  Most of the beverage stands were closed and when we finally found one that was open, the Icee machines weren't ready at 12:30pm!  We barely got to see any animals at all and many seemed to be in enclosures that weren't appropriate. Of the 3000 animals they claim to have, I'd be surprised if we saw 30. The Oasis Grill served mediocre food.  The burger was as cold as the lettuce and tomato on top.  Two sodas, burger, chicken tenders and 2 fries cost nearly $30."
Breathtaking,July 2019,50,Zoo Miami,PRK101,Had family over from abroad and decided to spend our early July vacation in Miami before heading off to England. The zoo is a must visit. My kids and my niece absolutely adored watching the animals and learning facts about most of them. Would visit again.
Lots of fun ,December 2019,50,Zoo Miami,abh2011,"Loved our visit, we hired a bike and enjoyed cruising round. The animals all looked really Healthy with nice habitats "
Good mission,December 2019,50,Zoo Miami,Alejandraposadacid,"It's a beautiful place to go, not to many animals but is clean, family oriented, average food but ,what else? Specially cool for kids under 10 years old "
The Best Zoo!  Feed the Giraffes! 🦒,December 2019,50,Zoo Miami,Noelley123,Food and drinks are expensive so beware. 
Great Fun,December 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,Roman R,"Went to watch a Heat game, it was great fun, even the cheap seats provided a great view of the game."
American airlines Arena concert of Marco Antonio Solis ,October 2019,50,American Airlines Arena,astridc2015,I'm a fan of Marco Antonio Solis travel all the way from Aruba to see his concert it was amazing and i highly recommend this place.
Miami Heat game,December 2019,40,American Airlines Arena,ActuallyKillian,"Definitely worth experiencing a real NBA game if you are a tourist..but jesus, its expensive especially if you were planning on having a beer."
"Arena great (with reservations), Heat game dire",December 2019,30,American Airlines Arena,2FatOldMen,"Our objective was to get inside just once what looks like a great arena and to watch a basketball game. The positives: fantastic space, good sightlines, friendly and helpful staff. The negatives: food disgusting, in terms of both quality and price; and the basketball game turned out to be very boring, with too many fouls, stops, starts and ""dance entertainment acts"". You have to question any sport that has to exhort its spectators repeatedly to ""Scream"" or ""Make Some Noise"" or ""Clap Your Hands"" and replays ""We Will Rock You"" riffs endlessly. Most spectators chose to talk and eat and drink rather than focus on the game, so not much atmosphere!"
Nice Memorial,July 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,monicabjorkhaug,"You can find This memorial right beside the Miami Botanical Garden. It is a fine place to get a history lesson. You can read on the wall about Holocaust, and get a picture about what happened with the millions of people involved. Sad thing, but interesting."
"A place of sorrow, a place of hope",November 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,sisterida,This is a stunning memorial which also shares a message of peach and hope. The raised hand is the perfect symbol of the hope for peace in the world. 
A fitting tribute ,November 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,GailGermany,"Fortunately there weren’t many people at the site in the morning. The sculptures were very moving. It is worth visiting, a very sober experience."
Remember the holocaust!,November 2019,50,Holocaust Memorial,browncondo2102,Great place to reflect back on the Holocaust.  It is free to visit but there are rules of ediquate.  There is a Memorial Wall to reflect upon.
Visit to Memorial,December 2019,40,Holocaust Memorial,O2381IBjustinb,"Went 2 years ago when my son was 7 and didn't really get to experience it because he was afraid of it. Can be overwhelming for young children. Went again today and was able to go through the entire memorial. So moving and heartbreaking. Very good reminder and lesson to think about leaders and where they are trying to lead you to instead of blindly following along. My son was reading through it and even though he hasn't learned about it in school yet, was moved by the images and captions. Very symbolic hand reaching up and some sculptures that were very well made. Huge well done to those that created."
Very Well Done Museum -- Can't Wait to Take Grandkids,July 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,David A,"During a Staycation, my wife and I took the People Mover from my Brickell office and checked the place out. The acquaria were awesome, and the exhibits top notch. The planetarium was fine, and I understand they have started evening laser shows, in homage to the Space Transit Planetarium that was a favorite of many of us children of the 70s...If we're blessed with grandkids, this will be a MUST SEE..."
A fun en educational experience! Not only for kids!,September 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,Martin C,"We spent a day at the museum and we had a great experience, the show was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. I do recommend planning a visit on a weekday if you want to avoid a crowd!"
Enjoyable visit & giraffe feeding! ,October 2019,40,Zoo Miami,gemmalugg,"Lots of animals to see, the zoo is very large and there are lots of water fountains and shaded areas around which was perfect for a hot day. Really enjoyed the giraffe feeding! "
So much to see,October 2018,50,Zoo Miami,maximillianthefoodie,"There was so much to see that we hardly had time to take it all in ,my favorites were the crocodiles such beautiful creatures."
Zoo Miami  just marvelous!,September 2019,50,Zoo Miami,blewnc,Worth the trip especially if you have children. 
Awesome Zoo,September 2019,50,Zoo Miami,lisettkiudorv,"It took us 4,5h and ~11km to walk throgh the whole Zoo, but it was totally worth it!"
Nice Zoo,September 2019,50,Zoo Miami,TheTraveler67,"Spent a few hours here while in Miami.  Nice zoo, well designed  easy to get around and no cages all open exhibits. Lots of Animals from all over the world.  "
WOW! so much fun!!,October 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,voyagerguru,We really enjoyed the bird sanctuary and owls as well. It's 100% worth the trip if you're in Miami and looking for something fun to do.
Great planetarium.,December 2019,40,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,K254CFtimp,"My only issue is that I don’t mind paying $30 each for entry but then why is the gift shop so expensive to get a souvenir, shame."
Very educative,May 2019,50,Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,vtvargas,Nice place to learn and take students.  The aquarium is beautiful. Im a science teacher and love it.  The planetarium is nice to.
"Nice sand, large beach.",October 2019,40,12th Street Beach,I4071IHarthurs,"Our hotel had arranged for complimentary beach chairs which were set up for us where we wanted them.  The water was clear, the sand well-groomed and the beach was not crowded."
Great beach area,November 2019,50,12th Street Beach,browncondo2102,We found the beach to be very clean and inviting. No problem with other visitors or loud music. Sand is easy to walk on and the water and waves were refreshing
Brief beach visit,November 2019,40,12th Street Beach,Cooterboo,"It was ""cold"" (74) they day we visited the beach. Had a decent crowd and nice sand. As the ""#1 rated gay beach in Miami"" we had high hopes for the caliber of people there. We were disappointed, but perhaps being a week day and cooler weather deterred the trophy boys. The beach was very clean with no seaweed! "
The beach ,November 2019,40,12th Street Beach,LollysLook,It was a gorgeous day and we rented beach chairs and enjoyed a day at the beach here. We brought Cuban sandwiches and ate them at the shoreline. There are bathrooms and outdoor showers. 
You can't get near it because of commercial tent cities,November 2019,10,12th Street Beach,demtrigmail,"Horrible.  And once you find your way to the surf, the have a 180 degree view behind you of commercialism out-of-control. You have to run a gauntlet of construction crews during erection and dismantling of huge tents, and then thousands of ""convention/show"" participants during nearly every week of the winter season."
Nice family park w large playground,February 2019,50,Flamingo Park,Echo T,"For a little play time off the beach! Lap pool, tennis & racquetball courts. Pool parties can be arranged w advance planning as well as birthday parties for children or other private events. The park boasts 36 acres of grounds including a nice large playground. Beautiful meticulously maintained family park in South Beach."
awesome for families,May 2019,50,Flamingo Park,vpme,"shaded playground area, pool for adults and kids, well run, clean, fun.  large fields for organized sports as well"
Quick swim,August 2019,30,Flamingo Park,914rupertu,"We were after somewhere for a quick dip as our hotel had a microscopic pool and we went to Flamingo Park. It was perfectly nice, the place was clean, you don't have to hire loungers and there was plenty of space when we went. It was a bit pricey for a quick swim and we only spent a couple of hours there."
Get some activity in your Holiday.,July 2019,50,Flamingo Park,monicabjorkhaug,"Loved this park. Here you can have fun in the water, you can rund on the track and field court, you can play soccer and alot more. Very nice in the midle of Miami Beach, in walking distance from all over South Beach."
Top ZOO -> in our top 3 ,August 2019,50,Zoo Miami,399marj,Tip: just 45 min outside Miami downtown; arrive early in the morning because we needed at least 5 hours to visit in order to have decent time to watch the animals 
Lovely experience ,August 2019,50,Zoo Miami,536kaitlynm,What a wonderful afternoon!! A spur of the moment decision and no regrets!!! Absolutely loved our visit to the zoo. We rented a safari cycle and ambled along the beautiful clean pathways stopping along the way to view the wild life. From young to old we had a load of fun. So nice to see how well maintained the park is and especially how healthy the animals look. To all the staff -great job - keep up the good work!
BIG,August 2019,40,Zoo Miami,erict1969747,"All in all, it was a very good experience. We had fun. "
Prepare to walk,August 2019,50,Zoo Miami,W7306YYstephens,"Zoo Miami is a large zoo with quite a bit of walking between major exhibit as areas.  Tandem bike rentals and a pay Monorail do help.  It took me 2.5 hours to cover most of the exhibits at a good clip.  The large size of the zoo allows for some of the exhibits to give roaming room for the animals.  It also allows for almost barrier free viewing and pictures.  Several animal groups had juveniles.  The 10:00 opening allowed for most of the turnpike traffic to be avoided (I came from 50 minutes away).  The zoo had plenty of water fountains, misters, shaded play and rest areas to help deal with the heat."
LOVE IT!,August 2019,50,Zoo Miami,Rhoan,We loved this zoo.  It is very big so I recommend renting the bike thing and taking the day to see everything.  It has lots of shade and the exhibits are good.  We go to a lot of zoos and this is one of the best we have visited.
Perfect for kids between 2 to 6 years old.,October 2019,50,Flamingo Park,maryseguratonelli,"Perfect for kids between 2 to 6 years old. its clean, fun, bathrooms are presentable and they have persons attending on the kids at the pool all the time"
Great interest on the area,November 2019,40,Art Deco Welcome Center,browncondo2102,This is a collection of Art Deco items and history of this interesting area.  There is a minimal admission charge.  Great clock outside with a day clock built into a monument for photos.
Art Deco Center is a great place!,June 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Loren D,I would recommend this place for all of u who are visiting Miami Beach for the first time! Such a classy place with great people working there! Excellent service! Would come back for sure!
Not Exactly Impressive,December 2019,30,Art Deco Welcome Center,Frank-in-SF,"Stopped in at this building to see what their museum had to offer.  The woman at the front desk was only interested in selling tours.  I wasn't going to be here for the next day's walking tour, so I asked about a brochure for a self-guided walk. She said something about being able to get some information if I arrived too late for the next day's tour.  Huh?  Having a self-guided itinerary seemed to me to be a no-brainer at the HQ of the Miami Design Preservation League.  The woman at the museum cashier desk was much nicer.  The video about the early days of local preservation efforts (70s - early 80s) was quite informative.  The exhibits themselves were less than stellar.  They mostly consisted of informational posters, many of which were repetitive.  The exception, however, was the wooden models of some of the old hotels, one of which had been torn down.  It's always good to know something about those buildings you WON'T be able to actually see because of misguided attempts at ""renewal"" . There were very few actual artifacts, and those they did have looked as if they had come from a vintage store rather than a gallery.  Save your money for the Wolfsonian, which has amazing artifacts from the area, many of which have a local provenance."
So glad we went!,November 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,Gettiredtraveling,"The first time I was at South Beach I did not go into this little museum because of the $5 entry fee, but instead stopped into the next door gift shop that benefits the work. This time we did go in and found it was completely worth our time and money. I loved the manageable size of the museum, seeing the film, learning history of South Beach, etc. There are interesting displays and relics."
Advise and shopping,December 2019,50,Art Deco Welcome Center,csellingham,"Fantastic, a wealth of knowledge and information enthusiastically shared. Great selection of historical and current deco posters which make great souvenirs. Highly recommended."
Very nice ballpark,September 2019,40,Marlins Park,Robert82462,"Marlins don’t draw a lot of fans, so concession lines don’t exist."
Good game,September 2019,50,Marlins Park,patriciarI7680DW,"Went to add to bucket list completion of MLB stadiums.  Good game, good food. Purchased parking with ticket so had easy in and out for the game too."
The full Amercian Baseball experience!,September 2019,40,Marlins Park,Robin H,"Whenever I visit the States, I like to see go to Baseball, and visiting friends in the Keys meant that this time it was the Marlins! Tickets easy to buy online, as was the nearby parking. Our fears of heavy rain (the Hurricane was not too far away) were calmed by the knowledge that this new stadium could be protected from the wind and the rain by an adaptable roof cover (all bets are off in a actual hurricane, of course). Great seats, and plenty of empty spaces in the stadium as the Marlins not winning much this year. My friends bought me the traditional beer and popcorn, and I later bought a really tasty Hot Dog. To round off the experience, the Marlins won in the 11th Inning - a great and memorable All American evening!"
nice but,November 2019,50,Marlins Park,Tykij P,"Really cool stadium super big, I was having a great time until some guy hit me with a ball. It was not very nice."
Marlins ,November 2019,40,Marlins Park,LollysLook,The Marlins Park Stadium is the home stadium for The Florida Marlins baseball team. The state of the art stadium has a retractable ceiling so it can be closed for rain. 
Amazing!,November 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,megeliz91,"So glad I had time to come here! Exhibits were wonderful, I’m also coming from nyc where museums are beyond packed and this was so quiet. Also all the staff said hello to me in every room. Architecture of the museum is also gorgeous "
Wonderful,November 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,HappytravellerLondon,"thought out collection. Great facilities, very relaxed, a bit out of the way but worth it."
Best Zoo ever!!,July 2019,50,Zoo Miami,tucsok13,"Animals with no cage, great photo opportunity-we just loved it... It was a promotion for entrance, but it would worth the normal price. Plan at least 3-4 hours, rent a bringo and go:-"
You have to visit the zoo!,October 2018,50,Zoo Miami,sandrapalmbeach,"If you like nature, you have to visit this zoo, you can go solo or with friends and family. Plenty of space to enjoy nature and to learn from this experience."
"Nice zoo, rent a bike",July 2019,50,Zoo Miami,reelpe,Spent three hours in the park and walked the first two hours. Nice zoo and plenty to see. The animals had good amount of space and the zoo is nicely kept. Decided to rent the family bike for last hour and that was a good decision.
Awesome place ,July 2019,50,Zoo Miami,jeff_cardona1,Haven’t been to a zoo in a couple years and decided to go to the one in Miami very friendly staff very awesome zoo experience would deathly recommend for people with families and kids you will love it
Large Zoo,February 2019,40,Zoo Miami,ALICITA14,"The Zoo is close to my home so I have visited often and have celebrated birthday parties of my grandchildren. Very nice ambience, great zoo keepers, friendly staff. Animals look very happy, it has a lot of facilities, nice souvenir shops and eatery and a trolly to make your visit less tiring. The Zoo is very big and need good walking shoes and a good bottle of sunscreen, Florida Sun could kill you. They are building a Water Park next to the Miami Zoo which promise to be a delight for all ages, the Miami Zoo will own it, so probably they will make a bridge or walking path between the two parks. Enjoy!"
Beautiful art,December 2018,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,Lilly171969,Was there when they open and they didn't disappoint  me. Planning another trip soon with my son and now my granddaughter. Can wait to show her art and beauty. 
Perez Art Museum,December 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,EvanGuthrie,The Perez Art Museum Miami is an awesome art experience. I really enjoyed and appreciated the variety and many different displays that they had available. The building is beautiful and I like the architecture and how everything is organized and later out. The art made me think and I like doing that. I also really like the outdoor area overlooking the water with swings. This is one of the best art museum experiences I have ever had. 
Love this museum,December 2019,50,Perez Art Museum Miami,sandy g,"This is a great museum, not so big that it is overwhelming.  Terrific gift shop, too.  Went to see a specific exhibit but it's all so available."
The Best Shooting Experience,November 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,HonestWills,Overall this visit really was the icing on the cake of our vacation. Thank you Nick for making it such a special day!
It was great,November 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,Co_schwr,It was my first time shooting and it was amazing! The People were really nice and my guide Will explained everything very good and clearly. The money was worth it!!!
State of the art shooting range 👍,December 2019,50,Lock & Load Museum,davidevo1988,Highly recommended was very professional had a brilliant time.max was very helpful in guiding an inexperienced person like myself his knowledge with the firearms was brilliant well worth the visit il be going again next time I’m in Miami.

Erotic Art Museum,July 2019,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),TaherAlbaghliJulian,increase the collection or decrease the enterance fees.
Surprising find,August 2019,40,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Q9383QCforeigngirl,It was actually a really great museum that holds a rather large collection. Some of the pieces are missing labels/explanations but it was a great experience! It is somewhat pricey so be warned but my husband and I felt like it was worth it. It was a nicely spent hour and a half. 
Good but not great,October 2019,30,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),Amber S,"We went here on a Friday afternoon and only one other person was there. There is a lot to look at, but a lot of it was statues of penises and vaginas. I guess I was expecting more artwork. There is a decent amount of artwork though and it had a really cool prop from a movie I love. "
A Natural Space Zoo,July 2018,50,Zoo Miami,classact007B,A Must See.
Fun day ,April 2019,50,Zoo Miami,ryanm321,Came here after cruise with kids for the day. Super fun place. So much to do we didn’t get it all in. Can’t wait to come back and see it all.
Amazing Behind the Scenes Experience,June 2019,50,Zoo Miami,David R,"While our original Behind the Scenes Experience was cancelled due to issues with the animals, I can't thank the Tours Department, and especially Sebastian for making our trip absolutely amazing.  The lengths that you went through to make my wife happy, is very appreciated.  Say hi to Toshi for us, as we'll definitely be back.  Good luck on your school Sebastian."
All Day Adventure,April 2019,50,Zoo Miami,Tisjohnboy,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the zoo. Loved the ability to refill my soda bottle at the water fountains to reuse the bottle over and over. I also really enjoyed the plastic molding souveniers. However, my favorite spot was with all the otters. A child sadly left their sippy cup and the otters really enjoyed playing with me and following the cup. They sure did like the bright colors of the cup. Be sure to get there right at open. We spent the entire day and almost didn't make it to all the exhibits."
"Wonderful, interactive experience",July 2018,50,Zoo Miami,2for1margs,"We were so pleasantly surprised by the inviting feel of the Zoo! We loved how many attractions were interactive, like feedings and crawl spaces with the alligators, bears, and Otters. We definitely recommend Zoo Miami to all of our friends who come to visit, especially those with young kids. Every employee we had interactions with was wonderful and kind."
Just ok,January 2019,20,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),26lauraw,"This museum used to be interesting and really fun, but now boring. There is also no gift shop. Do not waste your time."
Eye opener,November 2019,50,World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM),B4582OVrobinw,"Never been to an erotic art museum before, but this one is brilliant.  A wonderful collection of items from all over the world and all through time.  Tastefully presented and suitable for all adults."
Beautiful zoo,April 2019,40,Zoo Miami,jennifer m,DO NOT EAT at the restaurant nourish by the main entrance. It was disgusting. Kids pizza was inedible even to a 5 year old. The fruit cups were rotten. They only have 2 high chairs!! It’s a zoo where kids go! 2 high chairs is not enough. Flatbread sandwich was gross. Sister in law had a wrap n thought that was good.
"Big Zoo, but many of the same animals",April 2019,30,Zoo Miami,dinoa207,"We went to this Zoo today, and it is a huge and good loking Zoo. The animals was much the same just from different areas off the world. Soo a little more animals could have been better. The rest was OK."
Our favorite activity ,April 2019,50,Zoo Miami,susi23,"Once a year, on our family vacation to Miami, we always come and visit this place. Nice place and great for kids. Various animals from different continents. We can walk or taking bicycle to go around. And there is a monorail too. It’s very crowded on holiday seasons but this place is very good for family gathering too. My kids love to come here all time. "
Amazingly adventure!,May 2019,50,Zoo Miami,jgijlstra,"An impressively large zoo.  The enclosures were large and the animals appeared to be healthy.  There were more than ample opportunities for refreshments, restrooms and information.  We arrived early and had no issues with crowds."
A wonderful family experience!,May 2019,50,Zoo Miami,Jane S,"We rented a safari bicycle and found it to be too strenuous for us.  Tina, in security, went out of her way to accomodate us to in dropping off the bicycle and having security pick us up in a golf cart to return to the entrance.  Christopher was also kind and considerate."
People watching,December 2019,40,Lincoln Road,speedywales,A place full of character that I would recommend visiting.
Aging but good zoo,April 2019,40,Zoo Miami,ewl88,Theres a lot of walking in this zoo. The tram does help out but with a 3 year old its still a hike. April isnt super hot yet but still we were sweating and needed shade. The displays are nice and the animal well taken care of. The main cafe was close to entrance and was clean and reasonably priced with good selection. Bathrooms are spread apart so factor that in for older folks and young kids. Staff were nice but clistered around certain displays and additional cost venues like feed the giraffe. That was fun but was easily a 20 min wait in off peak season. 
Worst system ever to purchase tickets.,April 2019,10,Zoo Miami,geomv89,So I bought two tickets from this TripAdvisor site for a offer to go to zoo miami with my daughter. First the Email from TripAdvisor don’t reach my email to print out my tickets (double checked email and it is correct ) So I emails TripAdvisor and zoo miami 3/27/19. Today 4/8/19 haven’t received my tickets or a response. TripAdvisor is no where to be reached and zoo miami couldn’t do anything without the tickets because of third party purchase. So I don’t get to go and also haven’t gotten a refund because nobody I can’t reached anyone to start the process. Totally unprofessional with Coustmer service. Will never purchase from this site again. 
Great zoo ,April 2019,40,Zoo Miami,715autumnm,We went with a soon to be one year old and he loved it. I really enjoyed the giraffe feeding. The zoo was a lot of fun. We did the whole thing by foot. It took us about 4 hours to leisurely do. We went on a Monday and got there when it opened we basically had the zoo to ourselves.
Fab day out,April 2019,50,Zoo Miami,444gemr,"This zoo is amazing, lots of incredible animals. It includes the opportunity to feed giraffe, parrots, giant tortoise and the rhino. You can include this in your ticket or it is only $5pp. I did this and it was worth it.  You can hire bicycle buggies but we thought they were overpriced at $25for 2 hours. The zoo is clean and has friendly volunteers dotted about with information. It also provides plenty of water stops, shade and mist fountains. "
Beautiful Old Buildings,November 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,1991KEB,"they don't make them like they used to.  This Art Deco preserved building are just beautiful.  The colors and the style, the windows and the curves, South Beach is a unique area of Miami.  Even the Post office has the Art Deco vibe to it.  There are shops and restaurants all keeping the area alive and fun."
Shopping and restaurants,November 2019,50,Lincoln Road,markgcowen,"If in south beach you can’t miss this . Walk traffic free and see the art , restaurants , and stores ."
Careless environment for the animals,February 2019,50,Zoo Miami,marydunsmoor19,"I actually took a class called FIU at the zoo. We were able to walk on the White tiger area and was amazed at the distance to where visitors stand. It looks so much closer from the visitor side. There’s a train that gives you an overview of the zoo, including riding through the aviary. The island of monkeys is very entertaining. A must visit for sure!"
Great family experience,March 2019,40,Zoo Miami,elis412,"We had a great experience at zoo miami. The appearance of the animals seemed well kept and zoo keepers were very attentive of the well being of the animals. Clean area plenty of parking space and ticketing line moved pretty fast. Rent the bike, please do it you will move much quicker through the park and if you have kids (like me) they will have a blast. Be prepared for food pricing inside the park it is pretty expensive a lunch for 2 adults and 1 child came about $60 to $80 depending on the items selected. A little confused though at the monorail situation we paid a little more to have 3 feedings and unlimited monorail usage at the end of the day we decided to ride the monorail, we were told we had to wear wristbands to id us, however I did not see other passenger uyilizing these bands so I wonder if we were ripped off on the monorail usage. Giraffe feedjng was an amazing experience extremely dissappointed at the rhino feeding, this one is scheduled for 12pm and 3pm on that particular Sunday, at 2:45pm we got in line. Around 2:50pm the crew working that feeding open the gate to whulich the rhino immediately came to be fed. The crew took more than 10 minutes to set up while they hugged each other and spoke between them like they were on lunch break, so eventually the rhino left. Obviously the rules specify that the animal feeds voluntarily so to me the crew lost the interest of the rhino to feed from the public. We were left without this experience thanks to the waste of time of these crew members. Other than this particular event the zoo is highly recommended"
Nice Zoo - Lots of Space for Animals,March 2019,50,Zoo Miami,995randys,One of the nicer zoos I've visited. Very attractive grounds and plantings. My teenage son really enjoyed the animals and natural history presented and the information on ecosystems. Many unique animals that aren't seen at other zoos too.
Great Family Fun,March 2019,50,Zoo Miami,TripleAMom69,"We spent a lot of time at this attraction about 5 hours. There is a ton to see and do for kids. I liked how the zoo was arranged into continent sections to see the different animals! There were lots of different animal species to explore. Also different pit stops for water entertainment, restaurants, concessions, and little activities a long the way for kids to enjoy. A big win was taking a family sized bike out and riding around all day so you don’t have to walk the whole way! A great experience with many unique animals to take pictures of!"
South Beach and Art Deco,October 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,daviddQ9146VR,Love visiting this part of Miami Florida. The colorful Art Deco buildings are so beautiful. Such a vibrant atmosphere.
Was nice but needs updating,June 2019,30,Art Deco Historic District,AngeloPasto,Visited Miami beach with my son and nephew over the summer and found the Art Deco district very run down.  The buildings are still nice to see but most need to be painted and cleaned up.   If you have an hour to spare its worth the time to walk through the Historic District.
Zoo,February 2019,50,Zoo Miami,_pseddy01,"Love the Zoo. Amazing animals, beautiful grounds. Spent hours walking around on a beautiful day. Well kept and the animals are taken very good care off. "
Great Zoo in the Miami Burbs,November 2018,50,Zoo Miami,bellabella59,Many different animals and several sections to the zoo. It's worth the drive and you can spend at least a half of a day here. They also have special tours and offerings if you call ahead. Would recommend.
Great family Entertainment,January 2019,50,Zoo Miami,midiala l,"Zoo Miami is wonderful for a wekend getaway.  There is lots to do and to see at Zoo Miami.  Plan to spend an entire day at the zoo.  Zoo Miami is part of the MIami Dade County Park and Recreation park systems.  The parking is free and there is plenty.   There are new part of the zoo that have benn built with a water ride. A few water play areas for the kids.  Plenty of places to eat.  The food is a little expensive, but not to bad.  There are aquatic boats to rent.  Animal shows.  Its ideal to get there early when the Zoo open that will leave you plenty of time to do all the things.  The animals shows are about 30 minutes long.  There are several shows through out the park.  There is also bicycle rentals, you can feed the Giraffe.  Nice spots for pictures.  Very exotic animals.  You can see the Zoo keepers feeding the animals through out the day.  In the same area to the right side of the parking lots you will also find aTrain museum.  This entrance is seperate from the Zoo, but the history behind each train is expectacular.  The presidental train of Ronald Reagan is displayed  in the museum.  You can go inside each train and their is even train rides.  Enjoy a fantastic day of fun, food, animals, water play, and trains. happy days at Zoo Miami and at the train museum.  "
Unfortunately a little disappointing,March 2019,30,Zoo Miami,888jennifern,However the monorail was very slow and it was not meant to see the exhibits from  (just alot of trees and maintenance sheds).  It is just meant to get from one section to the other.
Not my style,December 2019,30,Wynwood Walls,JaimeD398,"It was interesting to stop and take a look around, but to be honest the art is not my style. I enjoyed watching a few of the artists work and wished I could have stayed a little longer for that. "
Great walk,November 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,ChiefM55,"Great place for an early morning (sunrise) walk, lots of plants and palm trees, plenty of shaded areas.  Be careful of the bicycles and skateboards.  "
Nice place to relax,April 2019,50,South Pointe Park,FT313,"Plenty of walkways and lots of shade as well as clean grass lawns make this a pleasant place to stop and rest. Nice place to take a break from the beach.  Nice for a stroll in the evening. Playground area, too. A pier juts out along the main shipping channel to the Port of Miami, so you can view everything from small watercraft to large cruise ships going by. The park appeared clean and well maintained."
All you need in resturants and Shops,July 2019,40,Lincoln Road,monicabjorkhaug,"Lincoln Road have it all. Victoria Secret, Nike store, Sunglass Hut, Hawaiianas+++ and good resturants.

Zoo visit,February 2019,30,Zoo Miami,Chesca M,Definitely splurge and pay to feed the animals! It was so cool being close to the rhino. We also fed the giraffe and camels.
A top zoo in country,February 2019,50,Zoo Miami,Flipside3420,"Great variety with expansive location. A long history of being active in the community. Some must do programs like spending a night at the zoo,  etc."
Great zoo with lots of animals and activities,February 2019,50,Zoo Miami,MJT0813,"Zoo Miami is undoubtedly one of the best Miami attractions and , aside from the heat during summer months, we personally think it’s one of the best zoos in Florida! "
Time to kill,February 2019,40,Zoo Miami,LoJo466,This zoo is huge! Was a great day at the zoo but I think timing is everything here. Most of the residents where not out. It wasn’t that hot out but I think is was nap time.  I would suggest start at Asia and work your way around. We started the other way and had to rush through the good parts at the end because we had to catch a flight.  I must say that they are very close.  Some were under weight looking but who’s counting calories there. A lot of walking if you don’t rent the bikes but they were costly. I rather walk.  I could only image the traffic jam with those things when it’s really busy.  Overall at good day at the zoo. Zoo Miami 
A must see!,May 2019,50,Wynwood,Denise Z,Very interesting and worth the visit.  Good shops around the walls. Take photos and just stroll around.
Beautiful ,April 2019,50,South Pointe Park,TravelsHereNthere,"Loved South Pointe Park! The views are great, especially if you walk down to the end of the pier. There is also a marina with many beautiful boats. I recommend stopping at one of the restaurants for waterfrtont dining. I could spend hours at the park, admiring the ocean, eating and waving to those aboard the cruise ships passing by."
The Best Way to See Art Deco!,August 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Timzorrr,"The absolutely best way to see it all is on a segway! No walking, a guide knowing the history and you can see soo much in 2.5 hours. "
Very nice place to visit,January 2019,40,Zoo Miami,AndreaRaul,"It's a very nice to visit with kids. But it's dirty and the sinalization of the places is not good. We went there during the rabies alert, and I think they aren't able to deal with the problem."
Really nice Zoo!,December 2018,40,Zoo Miami,billjack333,Food is OK but a bit expensive. The gift shop is good.  Plenty of parking and easy access from major roads.
Total Dissappointment!,January 2019,20,Zoo Miami,SandraW696,"With all the beautiful things to see in Florida, I feel I wasted a day here."
Disappointing,January 2019,20,Zoo Miami,Traveler2AM,"Yes, it was cold so a number of animals weren't able to be seen. However, there were many areas where there were no animal even inside buildings. A big turnoff was the lack of colorful greenery. Also, there needs to be many more signposts showing where the different exhibits are. The Miami Zoo management should go to  Bronx Zoo in NYC to see how a zoo should look like."
A very nice zoo,January 2019,40,Zoo Miami,Sharon R,"This zoo is quite extensive and you can do a lot of walking.  It is arranged by geographic area - Australia, Africa, Asia and so on.  The grounds are very pretty and the animals have adequate room to roam.  There is a tram you can get and bike rentals, also."
Amazing Art,April 2019,50,Wynwood,siw713,We had the pleasure of going to Wynwood this past week for the first time and were incredibly surprised that you have access to view such diverse and amazing art with no cost to the public.  It's a must see. The graffiti art in the area is impressive as well.
Lovely walk,September 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,Eloygm,The views and the walk alongside the beach was really relaxing- perfect during the week as you can avoid the weekend crowd. 
A Great Saturday Night,July 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Ira S,"To me, this is definitely the place to be on a Saturday night.  There are endless venues for entertainment, dining, drinking, and music."
Lovely stretch for a stroll,July 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Sonia F,The Art Deco district is a beautiful piece of history and fun to walk around. A must-see in South Beach. There are lots of charming hotels and restaurants. Delightful!
Open Air Mall,October 2019,40,Lincoln Road,nomari2015,"The Uber GPS doesn't work well and no one we encountered knew where the Alton Rd Cinema was. Our driver saved us. (If this happens to you, it's around the corner from the Nike Store.)"
Birthday Celebration,October 2019,40,Lincoln Road,Carolyn E,"Great a many stores to shop and sidewalk restaurant.  Love the art galleries too.  I do wish there were children stores to shop on Lincoln Road, "
Was expecting more!!,October 2019,20,Lincoln Road,Gpd2,Pedestrian road with top end shops but just lacked the buzz we found elsewhere in Miami.  Maybe it's better later in the day or in the evening. 
Outdoor shopping and dining,October 2019,40,Lincoln Road,martymar1970,"A one-mile long shopping and dining experience.  Even though it's outside, they do a good job of keeping it shady.  "
Lost it’s appeal and crowd,October 2019,30,Ocean Drive,badrax,The crown is much smaller the places did not change much with the times
Managing Director,May 2018,10,Wynwood,robertsny,Waiting over 1 Year for my refund. Never received pair of shorts.  Tried calling many times - won’t pick up phone.
Warning!!!  Car Broken into,April 2019,10,Wynwood,Adventurer539381,"We drove into the Wynwood area and parked 30 yards away from the Bakan Restaurant in a paid public lot.  We were in the restaurant no more than 40 mins.  Our car was broken into and all our luggage taken!!   Called Miami PD, who said it would take at least an hour to get a police car there but we were welcome to drive to station to file report.  When we got to the station, others were there filling break in reports.  Seems like it happens a LOT in that area.     AVOID parking with any valuables in your car.  Not a safe area!!"
"Lights, Color, Action!",August 2018,50,Art Deco Historic District,Rae M,"If you love the Miami Art Deco colors and vibes this is the spot for you, more historical with the style but does not disappoint good eats and nightlife."
Worth a drive or a walk through,July 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,LWRFL,"Love the way they have preserved this historical architecture in this area.  The buildings were mostly 3 stories, which probably seemed high at the time.  But you can just imagine all the invasive sky scrapers that would be here, if this area had no preservation rules."
Best of retail and restaurant of South Bch,July 2019,40,Lincoln Road,akifer506,There is something for everyone here.  Most notable retail including high end designers.  Many dining options.

Window shopping and dining,October 2019,50,Lincoln Road,beachjoy2,Enjoyed my vegetarian lunch at Spris. Loved both the Nike store and Apple store. Found some possible outfits for 9 year old grandson next time he visits at Zara.  
Shopping eating and some more stuff...,October 2019,50,Lincoln Road,johnnyboydc,I absolutely love Lincoln Road here in Miami. It has just about anything you want restaurants bars hookah bars shopping Apple Store. If you do visit Lincoln Road try NEXXT café. and visit the little shops along the sidelines. You won’t be disappointed it’s always a good time sometimes there’s even entertainment. Enjoy. 
A weekend stroll.,October 2019,40,Lincoln Road,Aldmintz,This a great place to spend a Saturday and Sunday strolling the street mall with something for everyone with restaurants galore.
Good Location for choosing a Hotel =7/10,February 2019,30,Collins Avenue,Hussam S,- FREE Trolley (06-24:00) ride in & around ... Also Public bus transportation (Ticket = 2.25 $) to AirPort + D.T. + Ft. Lauderdale + ... in /Close
Wynwood arts district ,March 2019,50,Wynwood,leslies555,"My husband and I spent about four hours exploring.  The artwork was original, artistic and refined.  It was so much more than we anticipated.   "
Worth a trip but street art is edgy...daring...original...often a social commentary: not here,February 2019,30,Wynwood,BAF_52,"I packed my opinion into the heading. The street art here is well executed but lacks bite or vigour. Yes it is worth a look if you are in the area but don't expect too much. If you want vibrant, provocative and challenging there are other places in the world...Orgosolo in Sardinia, the East End of London, Belfast...loads of places...most big cities."
Interesting architecture,June 2019,30,Art Deco Historic District,Ramadama,It's nice that the city has preserved these buildings for historical purposes and many looked well preserved. So it's worth walking around and taking in this unique site.
Ok,June 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,Tuki23,Worth a look but do not expect much. Especially is you are living in europe. It shows that this was not build to last
Miami's Icon,June 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,PeterTravelAdvisor,Simply a must see if you are visiting Miami
30% shops are closed...,September 2019,30,Lincoln Road,Andreas M,Maybe it just was too expensive. The remaining restaurants are super high priced!
Great Outdoor Shopping Area,September 2019,40,Lincoln Road,mmYumYum,"Great outdoor shopping area with a variety of stores, view of palm trees and other greenery in the middle, with several restaurants and cafes with outdoor patios! They are also all dog friendly! Coming from a place where dogs are not allowed on outdoor patios, I find Miami a very dog friendly city."
enjoyable,September 2019,40,Lincoln Road,ahmed y,there are a lot of big stores although there was no sale. we enjoed fresh street fruits. there are a lot of cafees
They have everything.,September 2019,50,Lincoln Road,maiaulrikke,Great places to eat and shop. Near everything. A nice street and things to see. I think lincoln road is better than the malls. 
Best service ,April 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,parisl420,Byron Julio and jazzman were wonderful today The best beach I’ve been to by far. The staff is friendly and it’s a lot of space 
Unique hip spot for a day trip,February 2019,50,Wynwood,TanjaYane,"My husband and I did a day trip to Wynwood. We found parking pretty easily, and then walked around and checked out the graffiti on the sidewalk and walls that is all over the city. We stopped in a couple of very cute boutiques and had some delicious Asian fusion lunch at KYU. There were a ton of restaurants and shops and a lot to see and do for a nice daytrip out of Miami. It's a really unique and hip area, worth a visit!"
Great graffiti,February 2019,40,Wynwood,holidayseeker,We loved our tour around this area seeing all the great graffiti wall art work covering all walls and outside areas
Great views,December 2018,50,South Pointe Park,jwobkk,Fun place to visit in Miami Beach as the views are awesome and the sunsets are beautiful.  Watching the cruise ships depart is a kick.  Easy place to walk and seems safe.
Entertaining,April 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Soleil122,"Our hotel was in this area and features as much of the original old buildings and art deco designs that are now protected from being altered.  We took  a walking tour of the area, and because of the talents of the tour guide, we had a very entertaining and enlightening experience.  Worth a visit if you are not staying in the area, which will also give a chance to visit the ocean and park and experience the main entertainment drag across the street."
Run Down,May 2019,20,Art Deco Historic District,devonelizabeths,Art Deco is not my style. That being said a fresh coat of paint and updated furnishings could turn this run down area from looking like 3rd world latin america to a great icon of the past. There is vintage and then there is run down...
"Loved Lincoln road , people watching , food , shopping",April 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Frances M,"Lincoln Road has it all , loved it . Lots of great shops  , food stalls , music artists , pedestrianized so great for strolling up and down . Lots of restaurants to have a nice meal under the fairy lights and stars at night , perfect place to relax and people watch ."
Really awesome place to walk,September 2019,40,Lincoln Road,Wednesday K,I had no idea about this place before coming to South Beach. Such a nice escape from the craziness of Ocean Drive.
Lincoln road,September 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Tonya B,It’s right down the block from ocean drive I wanted a tattoo I found it on Lincoln road amazing spot empire tattoo they have little cafe restaurants and this is mostly where the club seen is
Worst service ,September 2019,20,Lincoln Road,Pinina1111,We went for lunch and the service was so bad that even we was so hungry we ask for check and left the place.  So disappointed I use yo come yo this restaurant.   
Busy and loud,August 2019,30,Lincoln Road,Beach_cravers,Lots of stores and restaurants to visit but it is loud and every restaurant has staff urging you to take a seat and taste their menu. Lively and fun but you have to be in a festive mood to enjoy.
A Must See for Architectural History,February 2019,50,Collins Avenue,Jerry B,"We drove down Collins Ave to observe and enjoy the architecture of the Art Deco buildings.  They are colorful, beautiful and mostly restored.  Its fun watching people from all over the world driving and walking, biking, scootering and generally having a great time."
An hour of fun!,January 2019,50,Wynwood,Areeyesea,We had a great time at the Wynwood Walls. The murals are extraordinary pieces of art that are perfect to pose in front of and take selfies with. A fun hour to spend in Miami.
Beautiful Park,November 2018,50,South Pointe Park,Ric R,We stumbled upon this Park looking for Joe's Stone Crab and found it to be a walker's and dog lover's paradise.  Clean and on the water.
Betsy's,May 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,Middlemiss,"You must see this hotel, art deco at it's best. Go inside to the bar as inside it is a delight. It runs through to Collins Avenue with a huge ball connecting the two buildings."
A thing not to miss in Miami,March 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Jared H,This place is beautiful. I really enjoyed walking down the block. It is right on ocean drive so do not go to where google maps take you (it will take you to a residential neighborhood). It can get crowded but I enjoyed it.
Shopping & Food (especially fast food!) ,August 2019,30,Lincoln Road,kingnina113,"We strolled down their a couple of times during our time in Miami Beach. Most of the buses stop their, also the free trolley, and most of the tours, for example Duck Tours (would highly recommend, it's great!) or the Big Red Double Decker Bus."
Dinner with a very good friend ,August 2019,50,Lincoln Road,424lemb,A great place for me and my good friend to have dinner and catch up. Our preferred destination because if the diversity of restaurants and people 
Great walk,August 2019,40,Lincoln Road,valentina489,"One of the best streets in Miami. We took s stroll down rhe road and enjoyed scenery. It has everything for everyone; food, shops, art and many more. "
"Nice outdoor shopping, DO NOT VISIT MIXX shoe store on Lincoln Road",August 2019,10,Lincoln Road,Jeremy H,"The stores and restaurants are quite nice. One store, however, had such awful staff that it deflates the whole value of the shopping strip. MIXX shoe store needs a closer look at who they hire. Go somewhere else so that this store’s staff won’t sour your day. Unhappy old, Hispanic woman manning the store who clearly doesn’t want to be there. Lazy, rude, and unhelpful, she should be lucky that she hasn’t been fired. Hopefully management will recognize that customer service is just as important as your product before the staff ruin the business and it goes into closure. Please visit this store if you like being treated like less than a human."
Lovely place,August 2019,50,Lincoln Road,11DubsL,Great restaurants- you can even eat al fresco in the center of Lincoln Road!
Vaca,March 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,Brianna D,Charles has been nothing but accommodating to us! He has made our experience here at Miami Beach fun and enjoyable! Thank you Charles! <3
Charles,March 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,Hannarad,Charles Thank you so much for being so helpful and giving us a great experience at the beach . Definitely will be asking for you in the future!
A quieter vibe than Ocean Drive,April 2018,40,Collins Avenue,Eclectic E,Another main street of South beach but has a bit calmer vibe than the eccentric Ocean Drive. Plenty of cool shops and restaurants to check out for a change of pace. 
Not my favorite street in Miami-Dade!,January 2019,30,Collins Avenue,James S,"This is a commercial boulevard by all standards.  It is FL State highway A1A and as such, the traffic is fast, reckless and rude.  The stores and hotels are all a little shoddier than anything else in South Beach and one serious word of caution.  OBEY the walk or do not walk lights!  And, look around the corner as you cross.  If you are going to get hit by a car, truck or BIKE, it will be at the corner of Collins and (fill in any street)."
Street art at its best...a must-do when in Miami,December 2018,50,Wynwood,Zigett,"This neighbourhood is clearly going through significant regeneration and has attracted a lot of media due to its urban art scene. Strolling around the area, we found some great little galleries, restaurants and interesting shops, and witnessed some impressive graffiti murals. Best place to start is probably Wynwood Walls which is the epicentre for street artists and features some inspiring and thought-provoking works. You can also get up close to some of the artists as well. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Miami."
Lovely route for a walk,March 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,TravelSearcherBlog,"The Miami Beach Boardwalk is wide and clean, a lovely space for a long walk. There are numerous access points to get to the sand, and there are public restrooms every so often. You probably won’t go to Miami Beach specifically for the boardwalk, but while you’re there, take a little time, preferably at sunrise or sunset, to wander and appreciate the natural beauty of the ocean and dunes contrasted against all the lush tropical planting of the hotels that line the beach. "
Great walk,June 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,Sandy H,"I would have liked to walk more of the boardwalk but it was so hot I had to stop for a swim and then couldn't handle the heat anymore. There are signs everywhere that you cannot cycle on the boardwalk but of course there are people doing it. I assume these people cannot read and cannot recognise the sign No Cycling... Be ready with sunglasses, hat and suncream as there is not much shade"
This I liked.....,September 2018,40,South Pointe Park,differentname,"Great place for a bike ride or holding hands, catching rays or even snorkeling."
Miami beach,April 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,atiamsterdam,Miami beach is the place you want to be. There is for everybody something and besides you can imagine the  atmosphere of the Art Deco life from 1930s. Different generation same fun.
"A ""Must See"" Area",February 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Dana C,"At night when the lights come on this is a must see area of SOBE.  The restaurants glitter, and the people are glamourous, or funky, or just plain fascinating."
Stunning,April 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Ekom,"Stunning buildings so glad the history is preserved, the combination of low buildings with deco architecture the ocean and palm trees is wonderful. Must experience at least once."
Nice to visit but,April 2019,30,Art Deco Historic District,Allium D,"Not a young kid so the loud techno after dark from every store front on Ocean dr wasnt my thing. Beautiful area, nice beaches. barkers everywhere halking wears. High prices.  Nice for short trip to say Ive been there but wouldnt go back for seconds"
Lots to see and eat!,August 2019,50,Lincoln Road,mellstiller,"We had a ton of fun exploring on Lincoln Road. Our bachelorette party shopped, ate great Mexican food, and loved the overall vibe of what feels like a mix between cool nightlife and an outlet mall. "
Nothing special,December 2018,30,Lincoln Road,Sherry P,It depends what your baseline is and where you are coming from and what you like.  My preference is small creative boutiques and years ago  that could be found on Lincoln Road.  Like many things due to growth in the area and real estates' upward bound costs we are doomed to large box stores and restaurants with bases elsewhere.  Its too much like everything else.
all id there,August 2019,50,Lincoln Road,lalimarin90,"everything you can find here, foos and shoppings, all in one street, we eat at roalaia and food was good. "
Nice area of Miami beach,August 2019,50,Lincoln Road,arkhealthcare,"There are plenty of shops, restaurants and bars here. A good variety of food and clean area to relax and eat."
Average shopping,June 2019,30,Lincoln Road,D8095ZVjenniferm,"The shopping and boutiques on this strip are no better than your standard mall. Some of them clearly do not belong there. I loved all the outdoor cafes, but they were overpriced for what you get (service overall sucked, seemed run down, food quality poor)"
Love love love the architecture ,April 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,cathy66mg,I cannot recommend this district highly enough. If in Florida you have to visit it.

A beautiful park for the public,October 2018,50,South Pointe Park,Marion M,"I love this beautiful public park, with its lush greenery and trees.  A great place to relax and watch all the boat activity."
Awesome view,July 2018,50,South Pointe Park,Adventure19974385232,"This is a gem in south beach. You can see beautiful sunsets and watch ships sail away from here. There’s a running path, beach access and kids play areas."
Out for a walk,October 2018,50,South Pointe Park,scottcU4726DV,I imagine it would be a great place to watch the cruise ships leave from.
Great walkway,July 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,kerrith l,Amazing walks along this walkway. Felt safe and well lit up at night. Be carefull when wet wuite slippery x
Good for a walk ,August 2019,30,Miami Beach Boardwalk,jeanette_evans2,Was very hot and humid when we walked along and there aren’t good views of the sea . You pass the back of lots of hotels so it could be better 
Excellent place to exercise,July 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,Nikola180,"We walked and rode bikes here. Perfect spot to exercise. Flat, shady in parts and wild enough for lots of people to use."
Beautiful art everywhere you look at!,December 2018,50,Wynwood,SelSoma,Definitely make a trip to Wynwood when you visit Miami - there is amazing pieces of art in every direction you look! 
Quintessential Miami,January 2019,50,Wynwood,JSATfromTX,"Okay, so I'm not generally a fan of urban street art, but if you're in Miami, you really shouldn't miss an opportunity to wander the streets of Wynwood.  There is amazing artistry around every corner... unbelievable what people can do with spray paint.  It's free (except for a few bucks of parking) and yes, it is a great place for selfies."
"Wynwood-Great Art, cool neighborhood ",January 2019,50,Wynwood,Jamie W,"Skip the paid tour and just stroll through the neighborhood.  Parking is easy, plenty of paid street parking.  Take your time maybe stop for brunch or wine along the way"
Walking along,January 2019,50,Wynwood,juliob837,"This is a fantastic neighborhood for people all ages to enjoy the artwork and good food combined. Set out around 10a, get lost around the art and stores then enjoy lunch at many incredible restaurants walk a little more and enjoy a nice coffee and dessert."
A Shopping Walk,January 2019,50,Collins Avenue,PaulO620,"Collin’s Avenue is a great place for hotels, restaurants, and shopping. We walked for a couple miles stopping in store and enjoying the warm weather. As we were heading back to our hotel it rained, warm and refreshing. "

Historic District,May 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Peter F, Is I is a gorgeous city. The beautiful buildings from the Art Deco era create that charm and warmth. The concentration of amazing buildings in this district is impressive.
Glad there are people working to save it from developers,May 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,NH_Joe,"A unique neighborhood, well worth preserving.  Especially good in the evening when all the neon and pastal lights are lighting up each unique property."

"
Best spot in Miami Beach,November 2018,50,South Pointe Park,saphirasstory,"South Pointe is very peaceful. It is great to go for a walk, bike around of just sit on the grass / on the beach. If you go early on: it is a beautiful spot to see the sunrise and start the day off great!"
Great Place to Kill Time,November 2018,50,South Pointe Park,Maq P,"We went here midway through our trip then went back the day of our departure, since we had a late flight. It's a great place to people watch, but also has spectacular views of the water and cruise ships as they sail out since the port is very close by. The time flew by while we were there. Very serene and all you pay for is parking. Speaking of, it is a pain to find parking. Public parking was completely full, so the second time around, we had to circle around a few times to find a parking spot, but it was well worth it."
Miami Beach Boardwalkdo not,July 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,TaherAlbaghliJulian,"Miami Beach boardwalk .Is nice area to walk in Miami beach.It is in the middle beach.It is not crowded like South beach.There are many resturant conected with Miami Beach boardwalk.This area is very large.Moreover, you can cycle in this area. There was a severe lack of amenities such as sale of bottled water or availablity of water. do not miss."
"Run, walk or ride ",August 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,RJames1950,"The Miami beach boardwalk is terrific. A combination of pavers and boardwalk it is convenient for a stroll run or ride. Situated between hotels, apartments etc. and the beach it is great anytime of the day. Don't miss it "
Nice Walk,August 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,Audrey T,Nice walkalong the boardwalk - only problem we had was that the streets off the beach werent numbered so got off beach at wrong place and had to walk further than necessary in the heat which wasnt a very nice experience.
Nobu Hotel Boardwalk Access,July 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,TexasWreays,Just steps from the beach access of Nobu hotel was this wonderful boardwalk to explore and excersize our morning walks on! Loved having this amenity!
Lovely Boardwalk,July 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,melrowe2,Loved walking down the boardwalk peaking into other hotels. So nice to have a boardwalk to walk down Miami Beach. We took some great photos here as well.
Cool to see,January 2019,40,Wynwood,tif316,Was worth driving around and checking out all the fun paintings and murals. Would Recommend when in Miami.
Nice place to walk by,February 2019,50,Wynwood,Denys_travel,"Great place with some graffiti on the walls. It looked pretty safe to me during the daytime. It is pretty small, you would need no more than 20 minutes there. "
Street Art,February 2019,40,Wynwood,Wombling_Free_7548,The street which Wynwood Walls sits on felt very safe but if you walk away from there be mindful of your surroundings .
Wynwood is a world class destination!,January 2019,50,Wynwood,Looksmelltaste,"Wynwood made famous by their murals and walls is now the home to world class bars and restaurants.  Walk into Alter to see what the buzz is about in this gorgeous restaurant.  Stop into the legendary, Gramps Bar, for well made cocktails and live music.  A couple steps more and there are donut shops, boutique shopping and more in an urban yet artsy setting."
Main street through South Beach,February 2019,40,Collins Avenue,Renee A,"Contains multiple hotels, on both sides of the Avenue, and runs through South Beach to Middle Beach and North Beach."
Free trolley buses,February 2019,50,Collins Avenue,danfriedmanmd,"Collins is beautiful. Art Deco buildings, art galleries, eateries, hotels, shops, but it’s a far walk from the foubtainbleu (44th Street) to Lincoln Road (17th) so take a free trolley bus. They run every 15 minutes. Remember it’s the trolley, not the buses!  That would cost $4.30"
Nice strip ,February 2019,50,Collins Avenue,MrsSexy69,"Strip is nice with plenty of hotels,  clubs,  bars,  attractions and it's one block from the beach.  Very busy area with a whole lot of action. Very nice area. "
Shopping is 5 star,February 2019,50,Collins Avenue,Shelley H,"Love this place, I come at least once a year! The shops on Lincoln Ave are amazing and and I love the walk along south beach, it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when I am here. It’s very laid back and feels safe enough. My favourite hotel is the Loews and the restaurants are really good too."

Interesting architecture ,June 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,696jasminew,We had the half day bus tour passing by the district and learned history about the Art Deco architectural style. It’s pretty interesting and good to know. If you’re into classic architecture then you’ll like the historic style.

A definate must see,June 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,lbvguy25,Nice to see all the old buildings being refurbished.  You should even take a tour to learn about the area. I would recommend it. Even if you are from florida
"Run, bike, chill, swim",December 2018,50,South Pointe Park,sarahconch,"Peaceful place to visit 24/7 with cool lights at night and a beautiful sunset! Hang your hammocks and watch slack linners and hula hoopers. Great for picnics, riding bikes, running, etc. Trail is always clean and there's even a playground for kids."
Take in South Beach and the cruise ship channel,December 2018,50,South Pointe Park,richh954,"Beautiful spot to visit and take in the southern end of Miami Beach and the main ship channel going into Miami’s harbor.  You definitely want to be there in late afternoon to watch the cruise ships leave.  Finally, be sure to go out on the breakwater pier.  Lots of fishing and even better views.  "
Watching the cruise ships depart,December 2018,50,South Pointe Park,Beanie14,This is the perfect place to spend an evening watching the cruise ships leave Miami. They come right past you 
Great place to see the sun go down,September 2018,50,South Pointe Park,Nina B,"Great place to just walk around, even have a picnic. Lots of people. But take note, the gate to the pier closes quite early in the evening."
Rode bikes from south beach.,August 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,Jose R,Very nice area. Check sections where bikes are not allowed to in. Beach is very nice. Para sailing and surfing with sails in this area
Goes for miles ,August 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,Nugget O,I wouldn’t recommend walking at night. It appeared this could be a place for transients and some places are very dark. 
Good for a run and for people watching,August 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,DanFarr,"I took the opportunity to have a run along much of the boardwalk. There are sections of wooded boardwalk where bikes are not allowed, and sections of path. Essentially the boardwalk runs along the beach and connects a lot of hotels. It’s pleasant and lined with lots of foliage. Certainly seemed safe in the daytime. Not sure after dark."
Beautiful view and entertainment,August 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,Anna C,It’s a great way to pass a few hours in Miami Beach!
Brilliant way for exercise in the morning or biking in the afenoon / evening.,July 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,ChristianGr1965,Well set right in front of the beach and connected to the City through regular small side ways. You are not alone whetehr in the morning for Jogging or afternoon Biking - it is fun. Plenty of People around and here and there performaing artists. It is a great way to get to know Miami Beach from north to south!
"What happens when you integrate ideas, people and individuality",February 2019,50,Wynwood,747dwayneb,"Our Lift driver told us about this place, I did not originally see this as a ""site"" of interest, maybe I was being too touristy.   What an area, one again the origins of this area speaks loads to the personality and inclusiveness of Miami.  Here the paint and brush strokes beam as brightly as the vibrant colors of some of the graffiti and various other artists.  Both indoor and outdoor pieces covering several blocks.  Just awesome.  It was surprisingly busy, the great thing is its easy to walk to food, but definitely a cool location to peep some good artistic expression. "
Vibrant district,March 2019,50,Wynwood,simply-peregrinating,"A must visit when in Miami. Certainly safe during the day, we found it to be friendly and very busy. Something interesting to see on every street, including the excellent 'Walls'. Buzzing, quirky a great experience to enjoy. We got there on the free Trolley bus from Biscayne Boulevard which stops in the heart of Wynwood."
Relatively New Trendy/Artsy Area,March 2019,40,Wynwood,joelk128,"Wynwood has lots of art galleries, trendy restaurants and murals on many of the walls, especially the little enclave called Wynwood Walls. It is very crowded on weekends and traffic/parking can be difficult, especially on the second Saturday of each month called Art Walk Miami with large crowds and lots going on. Parking is by Pay By Phone app on the streets or you can valet your car at many restaurants for about $10... but if you are not too far away, take an Uber or Lyft (usually cheaper than Uber-compare prices)"
Great street,March 2019,50,Collins Avenue,Sirenita123,"A good street to walk down either during the day or at night. It is always busy with lots of shops, restaurants and bars to choose from and at night it comes alive with the same opportunities to shop, eat or drink but the street is filled with lights and music. There are lots of hotels lining the street - possibly because of its location being so close to the beach."
Walk walk & walk some more,March 2019,50,Collins Avenue,Gracie1972,So much to see & get into
Stroll along Collins,March 2019,40,Collins Avenue,nowpacking,Interesting walk crammed with people..lots of cool Art Deco buildings with a mix of shops and restaurants.  We ate street tacos at Taquiza.  Beach is one block east.  Extra parking up 14th about two blocks.

Two Collins South Beach. ,March 2019,40,Collins Avenue,G6957DB,Had spent our first trip at Blanc Kara. South of 5th. Very chill. Quiet. Second trip - north of 5th. Entirely different place. Like switching on a light. Crowds - jubilant boarding on more than that. Age difference is noticeable. Collins - a street that offers more than one vibe. Choose accordingly. 
Beautiful,April 2019,40,Lummus Park Beach,715autumnm,The beach is nice to swim land hang out. I also like to walk along the boardwalk there or go for a run.

Richardson Dormeus,April 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,T C,"This young man made our trip to the beach so comfortable and relaxing. He set up our cabana with ease. He was attentive and very helpful with our questions. And when we asked for suggestions for local fun he confirmed some great places we had looked up before that we were unsure about, but that didn't stop him from helping other people when he needed to. When you talk about friendly customer service this is what I as a tourist look for."
Shoppingstreet...,September 2019,30,Lincoln Road,preske,"it is a street, pedestrians only, with plenty of shops, stores and restaurants. ideally if you want to have a short walk and at the end you are awarded with the beach."
A must see for art lovers and beyond....,June 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,Sunshine34500,"Nothing like this district to witness the consistent growth of artists- new and old. Some pictures are priceless, others are worth taking a risk. Sparkling galleries mixed with the tradition. Birthplace of the Art Deco Period. This area is one of a kind."
Super buildings,June 2019,30,Art Deco Historic District,Bungaymike,"However, the whole area is a bit run down and tacky, and needs transforming as a whole to make the visit worthwhile."

Absolutely lovely.,January 2019,40,South Pointe Park,Beata L,Lovely and great for dogs.
Favorite Local Hangout,January 2019,40,South Pointe Park,yonsider,"I was pleasantly surprised by this large and beautiful park. I was greeted with impressive views of South Beach high-rises, the Miami skyline, and huge condos on Fisher Island.  It was obviously the place to be on a Saturday afternoon.  It was busy, but not at all packed, with people enjoying birthday parties on the grass, fishing on the pier, or cruising by on boats and jet skiis. The only place to eat I noticed in the park was the reknowned and upscale Smith and Wollensky steakhouse, which was doing a brisk business. The park is only steps away from the end of the boardwalk and Loomis beach.  It is also handy to a number of popular and historic restaurants, all south of 5th."
Nice place for a Miami Sunset,January 2019,50,South Pointe Park,RM234,South Pointe Park on the edge of the South Beach deco row was a great place to enjoy the beautiful Miami sunset.  Friendly people gather to enjoy the close of the day.  Lovely place.

Very interesting art,March 2019,40,Wynwood,NewOrleansfirstgal,We enjoyed the art.  It was very interesting and unique.  Each wall was different and I understand they change artist often.  Some of it was very impressive.  It is crowded but not so much that you can't get a good view of each wall.
Block Party with Wonderful Art,February 2019,50,Wynwood,AndreaUbok,"Love the murals, they change each time we go.  Wonderful shops, delicious restaurants & drink specials.

Proves art is everywhere,March 2019,50,Wynwood,Wanderlust1954,"Street artists have combined with graffiti artists to revitalize the  neighborhood. Almost every building is decorated with art.

Very dog, kid, people friendly. I believe you can take the Miami Beach Boardwalk straight into this park which is the southern most point of Miami Beach.  Great restaurant located right in the park. Smith and Wollensky. On Sunday around 430-5 you can watch all the cruises depart out to the Caribbean. "
"Great Green Space and Views of Beach, Islands and Cruise Ships",January 2019,50,South Pointe Park,11douglast,"We walked down to the point, which is itself fun if you see all the Art Deco buildings along the way.  The point itself has a pier reaching out along the waterway where boats leave the Miami harbor, including gigantic cruise ships if you time it right.  Good views north up the beach and of Fisher's Islands and down the coast also.  Nice that no building close by so some open space, hard to come by in Miami Beach."
South Beach Tranquility,January 2019,40,South Pointe Park,Canadianstraveling,"We visited South Point Park in January 2019 while staying in South Beach. We reached the park by walking along the paved Beach Promenade down from about 16th Street to 5th Street and then continuing past South Point Drive to the southernmost point of Miami Beach. The reward is a beautiful park with a pier and great views of Miami Beach and the docked cruise ships, as well as a calmer beach scene. There are also several really nice restaurants in that area."
Beautiful and Serene.,February 2019,50,South Pointe Park,Andrea M,Beautiful spot to visit. Great walk from central South Beach.  Great to see the Charter cruises coming and going as well as the Cargo ships.  
Sunset Spectacular,February 2019,50,South Pointe Park,TishasTips,Love going down to South Point Park to watch the Cruise Ships set out to sea & the sunset is always spectacular very relaxing & an enjoyable walk to the pier at the end.

"A must for muscles, music, and movement",September 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,emilyh9186,"My husband and I took a bike ride along Miami Beach in the early evening, and I would definitely recommend! We did on an early Friday evening, and although it was very busy, the pathways were large enough to comfortably ride and still leave enough room others. Walkers, runners, and even a woman on roller skates pushing a stroller, it is accessible to everyone! Don't forget to stop by Muscle beach to check out the almost full outdoor gym and gymnasts! "
Love it,September 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,henry s,"Great for get some workout, walking or bicycling, a combination of walkway and wooden decking, it's perfect for a stroll also."

We had a blast especially at voodoo lounge and wet willies. Learned some new interesting things, saw crazy cars, the views were amazing, and the people were awesome. I can't wait to go back. I loved all the different cultures, tried new things, experienced new styles. We even made friends and business ventures. Networking is important and building relationships is important. The strip had a lot to offer. Plenty of hotels, lounges, clubs, bars, resturants, and photo shoot opportunities."
Main drag,May 2019,50,Collins Avenue,Peter F,"Our hotel was on Collins Avenue so we spent a good deal of time walking around. It is a vital street in Miami full of famous hotels, restaurants and businesses. "

Worth Only Five Minutes to See,September 2019,30,Ocean Drive,Wednesday K,Overrun with tourists and the restaurants all just try to grab you from the streets. Go there for five minutes just to see it and then leave.

Surprisingly Annoying,August 2019,20,Ocean Drive,Don B,"Here's a tip - if you want to walk down Ocean Drive at night, walk on the Ocean Side, otherwise you have to weave your way through sidewalk restaurants while you're hustled to come in and eat, with employees shoving menus in your face.  Honestly, kind of left a bad taste in my entire Miami experience."
Unique items for sale in tents/booths on Sunday beginning in the morning!!,May 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,April C,"I loved the shopping they had in the park on the Sunday we were there in May.

It's a ZOO!,June 2019,20,Ocean Drive,Freije1,"Very disappointed in the restaurant scene.  They have people stationed on the sidewalks to grab you and try to talk you into eating at their restaurants - all along Ocean Drive.  There is no dress code for the restaurants and we felt some people were very inappropriately dressed or more like not dressed!  Seriously, no matter how liberal you may be, you would lose your apetite!  Eat at the restaurants that are off of Ocean Drive!"
Nice to walk but the drive......,August 2019,30,Ocean Drive,LoveNepal72,Driving this can be tricky.  The walk is nice but it is a bit busy and if you walk the water side it is more enjoyable.

Seaweed?,November 2019,40,South Beach,Cooterboo,"With all the articles from this summer showing pictures and videos of the seaweed at Miami Beach we were worried about what we would find.

Loved window shopping and getting fruit at the outdoor stands,October 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Carol L,"In addition to all the shops there was a wonderful pizza place-Rustica Pizza was a bargain at $11 for a generous size persona pizza with salad and a drink. Great service,too."

Great beach.,October 2019,40,South Beach,yota7,Beautiful beach.  Some mention it as being dirty but not what I saw.  Really nice and not too crowded.  Long and big.  A must visit.
Cascade of Pastels,April 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,alexandragoff,Such a beautiful area. Can’t get enough of the beautifully preserved Art Deco Hotels. It’s so amazing to look at the architecture and the colours. The names are all so interesting. 
Lovely   Area,July 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,TaherAlbaghliJulian,"The Miami Beach Architectural District is a U.S. historic district located in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami Beach, Florida.The Art Deco district is a beautiful area in Miami beach and the area famous in Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace resided, in a mansion on Ocean Drive.There are cool resturants in this area.fun to walk around.must-see in South Beach.

"Nice Art Deco Buildings with Hotels, Bars and Restaurants",August 2019,40,Ocean Drive,NancyLope,"I have been to South Beach many times and each time it’s a different experience; it honestly depends when during the year you visit or which day of the week.  On a Friday or Saturday the crowd is younger and louder.   If you come during the beginning of the week I find it more pleasant because it’s less rowdy.    Ocean Street is a must when you are in this area.   There are popular bars and restaurants.  If you like to see shows then try the Mango Tropical Café, different type of shows and performances.   There is also a nice outside dancing bar called the Clevelander which is very popular.  You will find Ocean Street a very busy street with people and lots of nice cars sometimes too."
Expensive but entertaining,September 2018,30,Ocean Drive,Malin_o_Jonas,"Our hotel was located on the Ocean Drive, and the street is very busy with a lot of restaurants and bars, which is very nice. Though the location and popularity also brings up the prices and it was really expensive here compared to the streets just one block away from the beach. Nice strolling area."
Beautiful views!,August 2019,50,Ocean Drive,tinkaluv,Walked up and down Ocean Drive with hubby and enjoyed all the shops and restaurants. A little crowded but still a must do when coming to Miami. 
Over rated crowded and looking like the NYC village in days gone by,December 2018,20,Ocean Drive,Sherry P,The food is awful and expensive  It is crowded.  I would rather walk up into the old Miami Beach area and spend time with authentic Floridians
Brilliant,August 2019,50,Ocean Drive,896ruim,"Any time, but specially at night thanks to all the colors from the neon lights. Amazing, not to be missed."

Awesome view,January 2019,40,South Pointe Park,Chellodi,"This place is absolutely stunning. While walking down the beach, it's a big plus to make a stop here to view the huge yachts, houses and a beautiful view of the clear blue ocean. Mind that it's more or less a viewing point rather than an actual park. "

Love ,October 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,johnnyboydc,I love this boardwalk.  You could literally take a walk along ocean drive while on the boardwalk.  I’ve done it from the 3900 block of Collins to South beach.  It was a very nice walk.

great walls!,April 2019,50,Wynwood,Briss C,"amazing walls, and everything is amazing! once you go in all you see is great paint and walls here! very interestring "
Amazing graffiti,April 2019,50,Wynwood,pupsanka,"Very interesting place to visit. The ""Walls"" place itself is very small, takes 15 minutes to review, instead I advise to circle around the whole neighborhood in a vehicle, and see all the buildings, they are amazing"
A MUST SEE,April 2019,50,Wynwood,imdarkside,"This is art.  The canvas is many many city blocks.  The art is AMAZING.  I have seen alot of street art around the world and this display tops them all.  My favorite part of Miami and in my opinion the #1 site to see.  So unique, you will not see a better display of free form street art in the world."
Cool area,May 2019,40,Wynwood,Mnochaj,"Good area, but I expected it to be bigger than it actually was. It was a big parking just a few blocks up the street."
Little Havana,December 2018,50,Ocean Drive,mitchc554,Feels like your in Cuba! Excellent food and always a great band to see. Beach in always near by. Take a stroll a nigh for sure!
Bit of a let down,August 2019,30,Ocean Drive,Anne L,The architecture is stunning but the area feels seedy - it’s a bit like a Magalluf. We walked the drive on a Sunday afternoon which I think was a mistake - go to see the buildings but go on a weekday when it’s less club 18-30 - unless you want that!
Nice experience,August 2019,50,Ocean Drive,ReneeSaliba,"Spoilt for choice in restaurants. A nice stroll too. I would take a walk first, see the menus of all the different restaurants and then pick. all of them (or the majority) have giant cocktails (Not for the light hearted).  "
"mini NYC tons of food, drinks and exotic cars",October 2018,40,Ocean Drive,djtrinivibes,"you will go crazy over all the restaurants, dance clubs, cafes and all the scenes of Ocean Drive.  The beach is right there so you can get away from the noise and crowds. There are lots of exotic cars passing by all the time and it caught me cause I am a car guy.  We took a stop in an outside bar and I had one of the best Pina colada ever. A must must when you ever visit Miami. Trust me you will enjoy and you can thank me later."

Shopping on Collins ave,April 2019,40,Collins Avenue,johnnyboydc,Allens Avenue is a pretty long and busy street.  On the south end there is some shopping. Zara H&M Armani Exchange Adidas etc. hotels restaurants etc.  I normally stay on 39th and Collins where it’s quiet  located a block. Away from the actual ocean. 
"Hip Hotels , history and hot people",September 2018,50,Collins Avenue,barnettBBC55,"We love stopping in the fabulous hotels when on Collins. Collins Avenue, also known as State Road A1A, is the main hotel strip and shopping area in Miami Beach and runs parallel to the beach. The Delano is worth a stroll through especially at night with all the white curtains, lobby, lighting and Art deco style. This street is different during the day and is a must see trip at night too."
Down memory lane!,June 2019,50,Collins Avenue,Sunshine34500,Came here has a kid and remains pretty much the same. Great varied stores.  Now multi lingual and a melting pot of different countries. Lively and colorful with pretty good pricing. Fun day trip and close to most too hotels.

When on SoBe take a stroll down Lincoln Rd,October 2019,30,Lincoln Road,susan33181,"Lincoln Road is a great spot to eat, drink, shop and people watch. Yes, it is over rated, but it's an area that you should visit while visiting  SoBE; day or night. It's really entertainment for the entire family; enjoy and listen to some live music, dance to the Latin beats or smooth sounds, gaze at the wide variety of street performers or blow giant bubbles with the kids. Have no expectations and you'll be happy that you took a stroll donw the road."
A step back in time ,August 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,Nugget O,"A walk or a drive down Collins Avenue offers shops, cafés, and a little touch of history. Several locations have been movie sets and you never know who you’ll run into. "

nice walk on Ocean drive,August 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,Pascale T,"Especially if you can make the movie connections with some of these places, it is very nice to walk on Ocean drive, between the beach area and the hotels. A bit price but well worth it at least once...  and some art deco is worth the detour."
"Worth a walk through, absolutely",April 2019,40,South Pointe Park,Elizabeth C,"This park is at the end of the beach and has excellent views of the water and harbor and all of Miami Beach.  It is particularly fun to watch the cruise ships heading in and out with all the other boats moving around them!  You have no idea how truly large they are until they pass you by.  Great walking paths, good green spaces, a very nice restaurant, super fun dog park, iguanas in the trees (!) and a long pier to walk.  Nice marina at the end.  Absolutely worth a visit. "

City Treasure,October 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,nomari2015,"So I stayed at the Palms and was a little confused by this at first, but then I loved it. Miamians were walking, running, biking down it as I crossed over to enjoy an early morning coffee on the beach. More cities should do this, but everywhere aint Miami"
Beautiful walk!,October 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,seasideljs,"This is a great way to get around and see the beautiful beaches of Miami Beach! You can also stop at some of the hotels for a meal!

"Urban Art is Everywhere - the walls, the streets, the signs...",June 2019,50,Wynwood,132danyl,"See this spot before it gets paved over and gentrified.  Get your camera out and walk around.

Ocean Drive is awesome!,October 2019,50,Ocean Drive,Riplis,Visiting Ocean Drive is a must when in Miami. It's like being in a movie.

Good for shopping and eating,June 2019,30,Collins Avenue,Joshane615,"We strolled along Collins Street many times whilst visiting Miami, South Beach. Lots of shops and restaurants along the way.

Will be back for sure,July 2019,50,Collins Avenue,linlyn2019,We walked this strip a few times while visiting and it's just a fun place.  You meet and see some fun people.  Did a little shopping too.  Of course I did.

Beautiful!,July 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,Desi B,"This park is beautiful! The area around the park is beautifully landscaped with palm trees, outdoor showers, and a bathroom. The beach is every better. The white sand is easy to walk on and has small sea shells in it. Depending on the day the water is clear and a beautiful blue. There are umbrellas and seating available everywhere (you have to rent them) and plenty of spots for you if you just have a towel. The are many lifeguard towers. There are also a lot of trash cans. Right outside the park is Ocean Drive an Art Deco historical street lined with expensive hotels, bars, and restaurants. There is also a boardwalk that goes all the way up or down to other areas and beaches. It's great to walk on and a quick way to get around. The only down side to this park is you need to watch your stuff, as there are homeless people wandering the beach and streets."
Beach exp,July 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,Marina F,Tim and jawena were awesome and very helpful and informative. Due to them we had a very good experience. Thanks guys!!

Beach Days,November 2019,50,South Beach,kathryn388,"South Beach was clean and very pretty. We enjoyed several afternoons during our vacation here. Such great views, and very walkable. "
"Narrow beach with very limited parking, difficult to access",November 2019,20,South Beach,EricA955,"Like much of Florida, this beach falls between the Atlantic and a brief nature buffer designed to protect the over-developed waterfront.  The area between the strand and the nature buffer was relatively narrow compared to many other beaches we've been on; winter storms remove much of the sand, and Miami Beach has struggled with beach replenishment.  Umbrellas and lounges are available, but the cost is excessive.  There is a boardwalk (covered in a separate review), but it does not have view of nor is it within view of the beach.  Access to this beach is via the beachfront hotel you are staying in, or via foot at passthroughs from A1A.  Street parking here is very limited and very expensive, so access to this beach is defacto limited to those who stay in the local hotels.  If your primary interest is surf and sand, there are much better beaches to visit.  I will say it was clean, although there were no trash cans in evidence."
"South Beach, Miami ",November 2019,40,South Beach,danks44,"South Beach Miami is one of the main beaches of Miami, Florida. It is a long and wide beach with gorgeous clean white sand. The waves are not surf waves and the sea can be choppy. There is a long walking path next to the beach that makes moving from one part to another easy. The beach is often very crowded and there is a lot of activity, volleyball etc. Along the beach are areas where you can hire a deck chair and an umbrella. I loved watching the afternoon fleet of cruise ships leave the harbour from the south end of the beach - starts about 5pm. "
great beach!,November 2019,40,South Beach,arizona-mark,"very nice beach, very popular.  great place to people-watch or enjoy the sand.   be sure to explore the boardwalk too."
Delightful beach,November 2019,50,South Beach,DidaWhit,"I lived in Rio for 20 years, so I know beaches. Don't know if we hit exceptional weather, but the water was delightful: almost warm, gentle waters, nice sandy bottom. In certain spots, it's shallow for many yards out. Clean beach. Went on a Monday, so there were no crowds. "
Good to spend a day,March 2019,40,Zoo Miami,84denar,I am not a fan of zoos but came here to see what it had to offer. Prices should be lower considering what they offer. I have to admit that there’s plenty of space for the animals and many different places to rest as you have to walk a lot. Bring your snacks and spend your day doing something different!
Great place to shop and hang,October 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Ayomur246,Definitely a must see when in South Beach!  Great shopping and restaurants. Happy hours at many of the bars throughout the day so you can always take a shopping break and hav a couple cocktails. 
Lincoln Road ROCKS!,October 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Shah G,"Lincoln Road rocks! Tons of great places to eat, inside or outside on the mall, tons of shopping, and even better people watching. If you're in Miami Beach it is a MUST DO!"

Halloween on Lincoln,October 2019,50,Lincoln Road,miamijosh2000,"Best place to people/costume watch in sobe. We got a pre-fix table for dinner with the kids from 7p-10p to watch the Halloween procession march by. Great fun and food. Incredible original costumes. Be advised, The later it gets the crazier and skimpier the costumes get."
nice,September 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,ahmed y,nice place to visit a lot of nice coloured buildings. It is a joy for all the family members to enjoy.
It’s a must see,October 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,GGGang,"We walked the full length of south beach. The architecture along ocean drive especially is just amazing and wonderful that much of it has been preserved. It’s an absolutely must see if you’re in the area, whether you like architecture or not I’m sure you’ll be impressed."
A must see area,October 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,dvdr1971,"If you are in the vicinity of this area then you need to pay it a visit, really impressive art deco architecture, showcasing some briliiant hotels, restaurants and bars."
A Good Thing Ruined,November 2018,30,Art Deco Historic District,Hutch20,My wife and I have been going to South Beach since we met in the 80's. When we first visited it was before the trendy fashion model crowd and Miami Vice made the area popular again. In the 80's the place was on the cusp and was inhabited by older Jewish retirees and gays. Over the years it has become somewhat of a tourist trap. The photo at the top of the page says it all. The canopies and umbrellas were not part of the original art deco look. Under each canopy is a bar and restaurant. They are a way of the hotels maximizing their income in addition to renting rooms. And you get bombarded with menus in your face as you walk down the street. I usually end up crossing Ocean Drive and walking on the other side as to not get mugged by hostesses. At night the place is beautiful with the neon aglow. But with tourists come the thugs and rift raft associated. Lots of pot smoke and kids just walking around. Maybe I'm just getting old.
love it so cool,November 2018,50,Art Deco Historic District,John M,this area of Miami is one of my faves Lots of cool peeps hanging and chillin and lotsa sweet rides being shown off by all the car buffs. It is in a lot of ways like going back in time. Way cool
Neat spot for views,November 2018,40,South Pointe Park,FraserCambridge,"The short pier at the end of the park looks new and is in a neat place right on the corner of the ocean and the shipping channel into Miami Port. Excellent for views of downtown Miami, for people watching those on South Beach, or watching fishing from the pier. Great spot to relax for 15 minutes or so taking in the views."
Beautiful Beach,May 2019,50,South Pointe Park,johnnyexpress,"Great energy, lots of fun. Beautiful beaches, geared towards the high energy of Miami. This place is rocking from morning til night!"
Views are Great,April 2019,50,South Pointe Park,Soleil122,"This is where the channel for the port of Miami starts and ends for the big ships, mostly cruiselines.  The point is well developed with grass and very wide walking pathways.  Since most cruises depart the port in the evening, it is a great location to see the ship(s) depart."
"Relaxing day, come waters, nice views",April 2019,50,South Pointe Park,Dmitry F,"Great beach, great water temps, nice relaxing crowd, relaxing atmosphere. You can also watch cruise liner exiting atlantic ocean. D"
"Great Place to Walk, Stroll or Run",September 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,Jim U,If you do not feel like walking on sand but wish to see the sand and sea - then definitely go for a walk on the boardwalk. There is ample shade and you can still get sun too if you wish. The boardwalk is well kept and it is wide enough for multiple walkers. There are no biking signs but there seems to be tourists or perhaps locals leisurely riding bikes on the boardwalk - best to stay somewhat alert during a morning stroll or afternoon walk just in case the bike riders are not paying attention.
Nice place for beach strolling !,October 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,557bj_rns,"The Miami Beach Boardwalk is a nice place for strolling along the beach, surrounded  by palmes and flowers, perfect walking both in daytime a in the evening."
Boardwalk with Beautiful Views!,November 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,je1058,"Always nice to go for a walk on the boardwalk, along this famous beach.  It’s almost always very hot and humid, so plan accordingly and hydrate yourself.  Watch out for birds pooping on you from the trees as you pass under them. Nice views of the pools and backs of all the hotels and resorts and clear, beautiful views of the beach and ocean.  Something we do each time we come to Miami!"
Beach and city access,November 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,stranieri_divertenti,"An easy and relaxing way to migrate through town, all with an eye on the beach and ocean. Keep alert for wheeled devices. "
Miami Nice,June 2019,40,Wynwood,FloridaMG,"Wynwood is the place to visit if you're looking for a hip place.  The neighborhood attracts artists and has plenty of galleries, showrooms, boutiques, cafes and restaurants.  Go and enjoy its laid back, counter-culture vibe before gentrification takes over.  It gets humming during Art Basel in early December, but then you'll have to put up with the crowds specially in the evenings. "
Mesmerizing ,April 2019,50,Wynwood,156claudioq,When in Miami don't miss this open air museum. Famous international artists show their  masterpieces here. Awesome huge artworks. Free entrance

Cool part of Miami to visit,May 2019,40,Wynwood,Legs26,"Heard that Wynwood was worth checking out so went there for an afternoon, whilst in Miami on honeymoon. Liked it for its interesting choice of shops and places to eat - not mainstream, much for independents and amazing wall art. A nice contrast to the glitz of downtown or south beach. Worth a trip! Ps - noticed, we couldn’t get an uber back from here but fortunately a regular taxi passed us by and kindly took us back to SB."
Must visit,March 2019,50,Wynwood,Emily G,"Must see place when in Miami. It is free to see the walls, great for photos and there are lots of good eats in the immediate area. "

Pretty hotels and fast cars.,July 2019,40,Ocean Drive,monicabjorkhaug,"Ocean Drive was pretty, but noisy. We visited in the eavning, but there was a lot of people there and cars, bikes, police. There was not easy to get a table on a resturant table, but we made it at last on Fridays on the south corner. I am happy that we walked down there ( we lived right beside the Botanical Garden ) It was just like on TV:-)"

Beautiful,September 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,beachbear8,"Wynwood is a beautiful neighborhood. Parking on the street was easy in the morning. We just fed the meter a few dollars. There was light rain, but that did not stop anyone. There is art outdoors and indoors. This is a free activity, no tour guide needed. We enjoyed the art. Would defintiely visit again."
Amazing ,August 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,NatalieH189,Come early or late! This place is totally exposed to the sun and you’ll sweat/burn whilst looking around. It’s worth a visit - don’t miss it. The art is spectacular and FREE of charge. Lots of photo opportunities and not over crowded. 
Worth a visit ,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Robert-Irene,Fantastic Murals. Great  neighborhood. Spent a couple of hours admiring the murals and exploring the eclectic shops. 
Beautiful south beach,November 2019,50,South Beach,markgcowen,An Absolute must
Ya gotta love South Beach,June 2019,50,South Beach,Jose C,"South Beach is for adults only but my wife and I love it!. If you're a young adult there is nightlife. There is beach for all ages. We love it, except for some weekends that get overcrowded (Memorial Day, etc.)."
From sunrise to sunset a wonderful place to be,October 2019,50,South Beach,kevinpat968,"Clean and blue water, so warm too (I am more used to sea in the UK!) a place to walk, run and cycle as well to relax in the sun - it is a must see on a visit to Miami."
Lively.,November 2019,40,South Beach,Sstevess,Lot's of restaurants and bars and the atmosphere is unbelievable but eating here costs almost twice a smuch as anywhere alse.
Great place to experience the best Cviche in Miami,December 2019,50,South Beach,norbertor681,"The food is amazing. The decor reminds me Miami Beach of the 50's. Elegant, formal, and cozy. "
It's all happening at the zoo,March 2019,40,Zoo Miami,philip m,"Our milestone for zoos is Singapore, Miami is not as good but close. Our one complaint is the maps of the site, which only provide a hint of routes. They could really be better."
A day visit for shopping,November 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Robert W,"Lincoln road is more of an experience and very well worth a visit (in fact I would say its a must!). If we go to Miami again it will be first on my list of ""to do's"""
A pleasure to stroll down the road,November 2019,40,Lincoln Road,TheInformedTraveller,"Interesting statues by Botero abound. Not my style, but they are amusing. "
Winter break ,November 2019,50,Lincoln Road,jennifermarym,"Loved this part of Miami, lots of nice shops and lovely restaurants. We spent an evening and a leisurely day at Ballans. Friendly place "
Food,November 2019,40,Lincoln Road,Shamrock88,"Loved this area. It was a really diverse area and had every type of restaurant you could look for and even better, it was surrounded by shops! The only downside to eating out is the expense. We got 2 cones out of Haagen-Dazs which were advertised as $6.70 each but when we got to the till it came to $20.71 for them. It turned out the 2 scoops of ice cream were $6.70, the cones were then $1.50 each and the sauce on top was $1.30. After this they add tax and service. We were the same in a Mexican restaurant. We stopped for 2 burgers advertised as $18 each and 2 draught beers which in the end totalled $63. It is a lovely place to visit but when you go to America you have to remember that the tax and service is not included in the prices you see and servers still look for an additional tip before you leave. Apart from this Miami was a wonderful area to visit and the people were very friendly. I would definitely recommend a visit to Lincoln Rd."
"An entire street of shops, restaurants and bars",November 2019,40,Lincoln Road,Casey1919,"This was a stop on the Hop On-Hop Off bus tour.  Initially, the bus stopped on Lincoln for about 20 min. but we went back the next day and had drinks and snacks after a couple hours of shopping.  There is no traffic on this road, so it is safe for shoppers and party people to have a good time.  An unexpected shopping area in the middle of Miami Beach. "
We took a tour and it was great,October 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,phelpsusa,We took a tour and it was great.  Learned about the history.  Also learned about Miami Vice.  Will appreciate Miami Beach even more.
Beautiful Area for a Stroll,October 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,TheDealBeans,"We spent a few days in a hotel on Collins Avenue. If you like beautiful architecture and have the time as we did to have a walk around this district you have a great time. The old buildings are lovely, if you ignore the BMW i8's, the Mustangs and other flashy cars this place takes you back in time. You can just imagine what it was like nearly 100 years ago. If you take the time to look you'll find some great gems like The Betsy Orb and the Betsy Poetry Rail. We loved this district."
Graffiti Galore,November 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,Q9994MRmichaele,Interesting place and local area to visit. Fascinating to see the artists at work seeing how deftly they bring the pieces to life. Definitely worth a visit.
Beautiful!,November 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,Prossie212,"Wynwood walls is a must visit. The murals are gorgeous and one just marvels at the skill of the artists. Plenty of photo opportunities and people are polite to let eachotherr take turns and take photos. There are also a couple of food options around so you can spend the day there. Security later came and closed one of the sections we visited for a private event so clearly the walls are very popular, even for hosting events. I highly recommend visiting this part of Miami."
Fun half day trip,November 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,somethingeneric,The area is hipster and artsy. The murals are gorgeous and free. You can walk around the area and there are some cool shops and some murals to explore. Highly recommend to check out Coyo Taco and Panther coffee nearby! It would take 1-2 to explore the area. The trolley does not come too often.
Mind blowing wall art,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,cpalit,So beautiful wall art! Very detailed and diverse and one of a kind thing to do in Miami. Plan to spend atleast an hour here to catch the vivid detail in every painting.

Beautiful South Beach Point,August 2018,50,South Pointe Park,RRaposoMiami,The squirting water feature park is a fun one for kids. Smith & Wollensky has a restaurant here overlooking the bay and there's a snack bar as well. Great place to relax when not crowded.
"Beautiful Area, family friendly",June 2019,50,South Pointe Park,sbmorg01,Loved walking around this beautiful park.  Family friendly and lots to do from riding bikes to watching the people on the jet skis.  Food Truck located at entrance for refreshments and small concession stand within the part.
Nice park if you are on bike and want to take a rest,July 2019,30,South Pointe Park,rava63,Not much to do but look out onto water with some boats. Nice place to cool off.   There are some benches and statues but not much else. 
A stunning place to get some shade,May 2019,50,South Pointe Park,glamourpuss1000,Well worth a visit.
Easy strolling,November 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,FREPLUG,"Very nicely kept, this boardwalk parallels the beach. It offers a stable platform for those not wanting to walk in the sand.  Surrounded by trees the sun is not too imposing. Nothing special but its there for use and not falling apart. "
A lovely place to walk!,November 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,JoHuChicago,The boardwalk is clean and well-maintained. There is adequate lighting at night. I do feel that mayhe the street markers could be a little clearer.
Don’t miss the Boardwalk!,November 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,buglet74,"Stunning views of the ocean, great people watching and there is a good amount of shade. The cyclists ‍️ do zoom by so be careful. I would recommend bringing some water with you if you plan on being out there for a while."

Amazing Graffiti Art,August 2019,50,Wynwood,Andy K,What an amazing area of street art!  We had the best time seeing the art on a Pedal Pub tour!  Wynwood is a must-see for anyone visiting the Miami area.
Conventional but Attractive Graffiti,November 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,grenouile167,"Nonetheless, Wynwood Walls is a striking display of pieces by various artists that cover the whole range of styles from figurative to abstract in an explosion of colors and shapes. It is certainly a must stop for every visitor to Miami."
Long awaited Miami visit,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,mkelly0853,I was mesmerized by the very many works of arts. I absolutely recommend a visit to Wynwood Walls.  The talent on display is nothing short of amazing as is the background of the artists themselves. Congratulations to all concerned.
Beautiful and inspiring art experience,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,stentroll,"A must if you are in Miami, much more rewarding than buying watered down Margarita in Little Havana tourist traps."
Loved it,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,HappytravellerLondon,"Brilliant day out, something for everyone, amazing art, cute shops, lots of bars and restaurants. Very enjoyable, would definitely go again"

Art Deco urban street ,August 2019,40,Wynwood,shatterah,Nice place to take a stroll. Crowds are fairly young so you get a mix of all walks of life. It has plenty of places to eat or drink. Worth a stroll if you want to experience all the wall graffiti art or just an urban part of the city. There are also plenty of ice cream or gelato and coffee shops. 
Art and Culture Must See!,August 2019,50,Wynwood,Hello_Hermoine,"Driving to this area at first is a little tricky if you're not from Miami, however once you get there, it is well worth the visit. There are blocks and blocks of absolutely amazing graffiti artwork. Expect to see everything from political slogans to mind blowing creative masterpieces. Allocate a good 2-3 hours to enjoy this area, it is worth it!"
A Lovely Neighbourhood,August 2019,50,Wynwood,tresmelange,"Most people visiting Miami have heard of the Wynwood Walls but the neighbourhood of Wynwood is also great! So many great shops, restaurants, bars and coffee shops to choose from!"
A MUST IF YOU VISIT MIAMI,August 2019,50,Wynwood,Worldalert,"You can't say you visited Miami if you don't see the ""Wynwood Walls"".   Great place to take pictures. Wynwood is full with restaurants, at all price levels.   It gets packed at night.  The parking will probably be a problem if you go at night.  An Uber from your hotel would be better than driving there especially if you are not familiar with the area.  On the weekends, it is packed with locals visiting the different bars.   "
Blackpool at its worst ,November 2019,10,Ocean Drive,Tomandjayne2,"Ocean drive has beautiful buildings but absolutely nothing else going for it, as you walk down ocean drive you are constantly bombarded with people shoving menus in your face what a shame something that has got such a lovely history is ruined by awful people we drove 3-4 hours to spend the day and evening here but only lasted 1 hour ."
"History of Miami, right in front of me!",November 2019,50,Ocean Drive,Lolamiliania,"If you have seen Scarface before and have never been to Miami, this is a must visit."

Nice place! ,July 2019,40,Ocean Drive,mehreenr1603,Must see! Its pretty busy all the time with restaurants being full and pretty good wait lines at peak times! But its fun to walk around and see so many people and then cross the street to go to the beach... 
Strolling Ocean Drive,June 2019,50,Ocean Drive,Scott P,"Ocean Dr in Miami Beach is where one will find swanky hotels, a trendy restaurant and bar scene and a lot of clean beach along the ocean. This is a place where one comes to see and be seen and it is a delight to sit in any of the numerous cafes and bars for a cold drink."
My Birthday Weekend.,October 2019,50,Collins Avenue,akayladabney,"I went to the beach at the Fountainbleu hotel and I was assisted by a guy named Zebedee, He set everything up for our cabana and not only did he do a great job setting up he came back to check on us and made sure we were okay and asked if we needed anything more than he already provided. Zebedee is very nice and i can tell he’s a hard worker! so if you ever go to the fountainbleu and want a cabana on the beach ask for Zebedee."
My Bestfriends Bday,October 2019,50,Collins Avenue,Dianni M,"Zebedee was such a great help, because of him I really enjoyed my day. He was very helpful and came to check up on me and all my friends!

Absolutely beautiful ,November 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,Sidriver,"We’d heard so much about this and we finally were able to include it in our itinerary during a family visit to Miami. The art in the walls and the small art indoor displays are absolutely beautiful. There are restaurants and cafes with a great ambiance and fun music. I would highly recommend that you don’t leave anything inside your car. Unfortunately one of the vehicles parked in a public parking lot (paid space) where we also parked, was broken into and had their belongings taken. It was about 4 pm and in a very open area, but there isn’t any security or much police presence. Other than that, this is definitely a must see! "
Great,July 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,raysantesso,"It’s a perfect place to take great pictures for your trip, amazing arts! It’s an open space so if it’s raining bring your umbrella."
Evening Stroll,October 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Susan R,"This is so amazing, and this part of town is very vibrant.  I plan to return for a strictly shopping and dining experience."
Art brought to life by Tour Ambassador Lance,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Skylight2020,"Made a last minute trip late in the day to the Wynwood Walls.

Amazing artwork,October 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,Gfam98,Very cool to visit these amazing wall murals and art shops. Lots of super cute & trendy restaurants. Very hip place to visit.
Awesome weekend in Miami Beach,September 2019,50,Collins Avenue,marcialg809,"On Collins Avenue you will find most of the nicest hotels in Miami Beach, Bars, stores and will be entertained by the people passing by, not to mention that the beach access is super close."
Take A Stroll,October 2019,30,Collins Avenue,547tedl,"A parallel block to the beach, one block away.  You can find a restaurant with your eyes closed.  Expect to see a wide range of tropical dressed people on the exposed side.  Only two lanes wide.  The budget hotels are on this block."
Day visit to Collins Avenue,March 2019,40,Collins Avenue,simply-peregrinating,Another great place to see Art Nouveau architecture. Much busier than Ocean Drive as Collins is a main road with many eateries and shops running down it. The northern end has some large 1930's hotels. Probably more varied architecture than Ocean Drive. Look out for Essex House which resembles a cruise ship.
Beautiful Beach,August 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,Iponema,"The Lummus Park Beach is located directly across the street from the Art Deco hotels on Ocean Drive.  It features volley ball nets where you can see people playing sets of volley ball everyday, a bicycle path, a walking path, and entrance onto the beach itself.  You see people exercising and having fun! "
Beautiful & fun,June 2019,30,Lummus Park Beach,huggio,We walked and biked through LPB many times during our week in Miami Beach. It was lively and fun without being too intense. Great for people-watching!
Excellent service,August 2019,50,Lummus Park Beach,Drakelynn,"I am from New Jersey, a few days ago I came to the beach to enjoy the water and unexpectedly a gentleman by the name of Jordan came to me and discussed what you guys had to offer. He really made my time very special in Miami. His customer service was excellent. I highly recommend for people to ask for his services!"

Magical Place lovely street art !,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,180rikak,Lovely place to visit in Miami. lots of street art in a place that was couple of years ago an area you wouldn't like to visit. I had a very nice visit. would recommended to visit Wynwood during your visit in Miami. a must to do !
Amazing place colorful ,December 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,MarciaBruineis,"The place is so security you feel free there and the best part is free access, you can see a lot arts."
Well worth the visit! ,December 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,h4386c,We had the pleasure of watching multiple artists working on their masterpieces during our visit. I was told the art work changes every so often so we were lucky to have seen the new and the old before it was removed. Total time spent was roughly 20mins or so but ensure you walk around in area nearby there as there’s plenty more artwork to see in the neighbourhood.
Unique graffiti art on display,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,dianeluvshiking,"No charge to get in. I would leave small kids at home, but bring your older kids, and let them appreciate the different textures and styles."
The murals are breathtakingly beautiful,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Alex R,"The entire area is full of beautiful large scale murals, but those within the Wynwood Walls exhibition are the beast IMHO. When we visited, there was a exhibition by the artist Kobra, whose work we had marvelled at in Rio de Janeiro a few years back, and it was a truly unexpected and unadulterated delight sure to see more of his work. It's definitely worth a visit, even if you're not a dyed-in-the-wool art lover."
Colors and Purpose,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,lua5721,Miami has changed so much from when I grew up there 30+ years ago. Wynwood is one of those changes that captures the essence of Miami and where it's headed artistically. 
Really Interesting,October 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Raven_44x,"After travelling through on the bus tour decided to spend an afternoon in Wynwood. Loads of character, walls are amazing and plenty of cafes/bars for a pit-stop. Lovely afternoon and well worth a visit"
Cool drive while viewing wall murals / graffities,March 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,Voyage_familial,We spend a quick hour in this artsy area and many murals at every corner.  Some areas look sketchy but most places look gentrified. Nice little coffee shops and restaurant dot the area.  Neighbouring to some designer shops on the east side.  
Worth a walk,December 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Roman R,"A friend took us here as a place to see whilst in Miami, it was definitely worth a visit which will take less than 2hrs."
Definitely worth the trek,August 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,travellingcherry,"As a tourist Wynwood was quite difficult to get to on public transport but it's worth a taxi. The fenced gallery is free and features some brilliant pieces but wandering around the surrounding area you will find lots more wonderful walls. Big, brightly coloured and absolutely free, what's not to like?"
Miami beach,December 2019,10,South Beach,Cfulanito,It's a sh1tty place full of pretenders and with high prices...with less than 50% money I can go to a better beach and with 3 or 4 times better food and prices in South America...worst place ever
Amazing!,December 2019,50,South Beach,deneen_coleashbury,Wow! What a beautiful beach!! I was pleasantly surprised by the beach although the sign for chair and umbrella rental suggested an outrageous price!! The sea around the beach offers lots for you to see and do! 
Love It,May 2019,50,South Beach,SarahFalconUSA,"Clean sand, blue water and a quite place to relax is all we wanted and we got it! We will go back. Thank you"
Best mornings,December 2019,50,South Beach,Nicaraguaonmymind,If you haven’t gotten up before work to see the sunrise on south beach then you’re missing something 
South Beach is special,November 2019,50,South Beach,c c,South beach is a world famous special location The beach is beautiful. The boardwalk is wide and comfortable. The people are beautiful.
"Large variety of animals, most have lots of space to roam..",March 2019,50,Zoo Miami,IvanR802,Nicely designed zoo. Most animals have a decent amount of space to roam. We rented the 6 person bike which is a great way to get around since it’s a large zoo and it also helps to avoid the sun since it has a canopy. 
Great outdoor dining and shopping,June 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Jose C,We enjoy walking around and people watching. 
Nice day here.,November 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Sstevess,Had done a beach day the day before and decided to come here for a few hours which was great. Liked that there were no cars so comfortable to relax and wander around looking at the shops and restaurants and people! Stopped for a meal and also did some shopping. There is also a cinema if you fancy it. Good experience.
Miami Beach essential.,December 2019,50,Lincoln Road,MiamiBeachMark,"Constantly in a state of gentrification which brings in some of the more large national retailers rather than mom and pop shops (gentrification is not always a good thing), but it still is the best people watching in the city"
So much to do on Lincoln Road,October 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Tavares242,Quite a few good restaurants and shopping up and down Lincoln road. There is also a great movie theater.
Excellent!,October 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Tribefanne,"Really cool art displays. Can do a self walking tour or go with a group. I did my own tour and was left wondering about many of the artwork, so would definitely pay for an organized tour next time. I love that it changes frequently I would not hesitate to return when in Miami again."

Great Tour with Lance! ,November 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Angela225,Brilliant tour of Wynwood Walls with Lance. We would have missed so many details without him and he brought so much background and stories to the art. It made the visit really special. 
Not bad.,November 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,779alexandery,"It was not bad, not good, something averaged. Parking was expensive. 10 dollars for 2 hours. We did not find good restorans around as well."
A mandatory visit for anyone visiting Miami,October 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,R B,"One of my favorite places as a local to just walk around and think, or get the brain going with new ideas"
Beautiful Gem - Not to Miss,November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,littleone1118,"What a beautiful gem in the middle of Miami.  Even the driveway & parking lot are lush and shady.  Veterans get in free and get a 10% discount in the cafe/shop.  Regular admission was $22.  The gardens are lovely and the rooms inside are breathtaking with incredible ceilings, marble, fireplaces, statues, murals, artwork, etc."
Peaceful and beauty,November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,CatsiMari,The house is a big mansion that is must see for tourists. There is a large manicured garden and provides some historical insight into Miami. This is a good place to go walk through gardens and view the bay.
luxurious villa in old Europe style,November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Laura G,"This beautiful mansion and the gardens around it are laid out in symmetrical manner.The main entrance opens into central open air courtyard and the view of the ocean beyond. From the courtyard the building splits into two wings, both two story high. Each room is lavishly decorated up the walls and ceilings. Close attention to every detail is evident throughout the mansion. It is had to believe this was just a winter getaway for this wealthy industrialist from Chicago. He had great taste for art and the money to create this wonderful villa we can visit today. A beautiful place to have a wedding reception."
Beautiful ,November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Travellingsince1981,"Beautiful estate.  While it’s owner isn’t someone if widespread fame, still interesting history and learning the way of life from its era.  Enjoyed walking through the house and peaceful gardens. "

Architectural Delight,June 2019,30,Art Deco Historic District,Scott P,The Art Deco Historic District runs along Collins Ave and is a place where can stay at the numerous hotels or book a sightseeing tour of the Everglades. There is also a youth hostel in this area for the budget minded traveler.
Very nostalgic,November 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,browncondo2102,"2 different areas by day and by night. Many hotels and restaurants in the area as well as South Beach. By day it is easy to walk around and enjoy the area.  At night it changes into a crowded area with outdoor restaurants, music and the hotels are all lit up."
Just Amazing,November 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,coachee1313,"Besides all if the great restaurants and shopping, if you enjoy Art Deco architecture this is a spot to see. One after another, these old buildings that have been beautifully restored are eye catching."
Beautiful ,November 2019,50,Art Deco Historic District,TheInformedTraveller,It's well worth a walk around the area and enjoy people living in what is almost a real life museum. 
Almost a hidden gem,June 2019,40,South Pointe Park,huggio,"Walking most places from our hotel in South Beach, we almost missed this park. Fortunately we saw it on the way back from a day cruise to the Bahamas. We walked through the next day and went back later a biked from end to end. It was lovely, with several activities going on."
nice place to visit,November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,taureau44,"since it was raining that day, it was good timing to visit this Vizcaya museum and gardens ,had good time and took pictures, plenty parking ,no complaint"
Well worth the visit,October 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Riplis,After your visit there's just a short walk to the Wynwood brewing company for some locally brewed beer.
Street art at its best,October 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,anat4om,"Free of charge and top of the line for world famous street art and graffiti since 2009. Every couple of months the art is changed, so one can come again and again and always see something new. What a fabulous concept. Highly recommended."
Too short!,October 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,JFrancois_IM,Very beautiful murals but a very short walk.  1 hour max to go around and visit the few galleries.  All arts are un-affordable...Something to do on a late evening or early morning as it gets to be tooooo hot to walk around during at midday or early afternoon. 
Interesting collection,October 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,vagolferbob,Great collection of street art easy to get to. We used hop on hop off bus to get there. Beware no public toilets.
A must see,October 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,John N,Some of the art work on the street  buildings is amazing. The private gallery is well worth a visit and the art work there is unbelievable.Be prepared to spend some time there. 
What a wonderfull place to visit.,November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Joel C,"Walking the grounds of this museum takes you back to early Mimai days. It was beutiful.  It looks like you can rent for Weddings and social events.  It was very neet inside, and they have done a fantasitc job of presurveing the buildings and grouds.  It is worth the price of admission."
An enchanted world,November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,grenouile167,"This visit, in summary, was quite magical and very satisfying. It allows to remove oneself from the hustle and bustle of the city center, that is only distant by a few miles. This is a must visit for anyone traveling to the Miami area."
Unique insight to old Miami wealth,October 2019,40,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,drewllew,"Vizcaya is well worth the visit. It's a little out of the way from Miami and the beaches, but the trip is worthwhile. Vizcaya is probably one of the first summer homes of the ultra wealthy, so very much in keeping with Miami today. It is a serene and beautiful environment inside and out but the house is probably the most spectacular. Of course, it is nothing compared to Old European stately homes but for Miami, it is certainly a sight to see."
"Vizcaya, Oh maya. Must see.",November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Captain1002,"Newport has Marble House, Palm Beach the Flagler and Miami has Vizcaya. One of the  most architecturally dramatic examples of another time and place. It’s hard to imagine, but the magnificent residence is surrounded by a tropical jungle and opens to the vast expanse of Biscayne Bay. A one of a kind experience."
Great views but closes early,September 2019,50,South Pointe Park,Kac N,"We walked from our hotel Urbanica The Meridian Hotel, Miami Beach, nice walk. the point was breath taking. the only complaint is that they close a little early for my taste. I would have loved to see the sun set from there. "

Great,November 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,cassandrao810,"If you need a walk or a run this is the place. Lots of people all the time, but theres room for everyone. Remember that bikes are not allowed throughout the whole boardwalk."
Good boatdwalk,November 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,K7451JHalexk, Nice boardwalk to walk around. It is good to see that the boardwalk is in a good shape and it is enough space for pedestrians an bicyclists.
Outdoor Art Gallery,October 2019,40,Wynwood Walls,Simara,Really fun visit for people who enjoy art. Just looking at the buildings with amazing murals to the Wyndwood walls and doors exhibit it’s a full day activity that is free to enjoy. Just be ready to walk a lot. There are several rather expensive food trucks around but they are good as well. 
Artful place,October 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,Wilfredo C,You will need about tow hours to really enjoy the area.  Nice trendy restaurants and bars in the area.

Beautiful home and gardens,November 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,sleepy155,"An impressive home and gardens on the Biscayne Bay.

See what it was like to be 1920’s wealthy!,September 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,tomcranley,"A stunning tourist attraction, with a collection that would be near-impossible to gather in the modern era. Walking through the gardens is a must, keep an eye out for the big iguana!! "
Nothing like in the world,December 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,MiamiBeachMark,"Nothing like it in the world. With most greedy ignorant city planners and corporations building revenue producing space right up to the waters edge, Miami Beach is a rare exception. Nestled between the beach, a natural beach erosion prevention area and the hotels lining Collins, this walkway allows the entire area to breathe, and is a must do!"
Love the boardwalk,November 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,O2381IBjustinb,"Nice path with plenty of benches and even water fountains along. We only went from about 18th street to the pier and there were quite a few public bathrooms along the way. A couple play areas, muscle gym, people selling their crafts; it is an enjoyable walk. Well lit at night and very sunny during the day. Not a lot of shade so plan accordingly."
Boardwalk,November 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,taisa2001,The only good thing about the hotel I chose was that it was opposite this place.  Really enjoyed.  Great for walking.
Nice to see,October 2019,40,Wynwood,raymondt113,This is a place in downtown Miami that was in bad shape and they star painting vary nice graphitti.

Mind Blown!,October 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,552NathanG,"They did this with a spray can!? I was overwhelmed by the talent shown in these artworks and I'm certain, judging by the crowd, that the rest of the public present were too. Took so many photographs and appreciated the other art forms in the surrounding area. It's well worth the trip to see it, double up and catch the hop on hop off bus that'll take you directly there and grab some lunch from the diners in the area."
Italian Renaissance ,October 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,BillMeontheroad,And the house and gardens we're better than that! Statuary deserving of Florence. Lush walkways. AAA discount. And free parking.

Great mysterious Museum,December 2018,40,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,kasanmoenadi,"Great trip with wife. traveled with local transportation. a little bit to walk. if you love history and mystery, than I recommend this to do in Miami.

A Must on things to do.,November 2019,50,Wynwood,Alvaradom77,"This small town dedicated to art and artists is a must see. Art everywhere. Surrounded by great shops and food. When the sun goes down this place has some great lounges, outdoor clubs and bars to go to. Food Trucks were Great!!"
Exactly the evironment you want for a South Beach Vacation.,November 2019,50,Ocean Drive,Rick M,"Vibrant, colorful and exciting with the peaceful back drop of the ocean across the street.  Lots of sidewalk seating and lots of restaurants with diverse menu's.  Love the art deco architecture and the cool ocean breezed. "
Ocean Drive ,November 2019,40,Ocean Drive,LollysLook,The strip in South Beach. It’s the place to see and be seen. Stroll the Drive or cruise it. Hot cars with loud music and dressed up couples are in attendance at night near the clubs. By day the cafes are full of people enjoying the sunshine and Waterviews
Excellent views of the buildings and the beach,November 2019,40,Ocean Drive,Casey1919,Ocean Drive runs along the beach in the southern end of Miami Beach.  Easy walking distance to the beach but limited parking.  A nice drive to see the building and people.  A bicycle cab is a nice option if you can find one.  A fun drive with nice looking building and beach views.
Magical,September 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,kimberlylopez1,Had a blast visiting the Vizcaya museum! Art was full of so much detail and it was just so peaceful! It’s also great for photos. If you get a chance to visit Miami this is one of the places you should come and see.
Beautiful place to wander and admire,October 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Dr-Z89,A must see for folks who have a few days in Miami and want to admire this Italianate mansion.  Teleport yourself back to the life of the wealthy industrialists from hundred years ago.
Now that’s a winter house,October 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Hendersoned,This is a really amazing house and gardens built by an eccentric rich guy. Let’s do see tour the house I suggest the audio tour for five dollars extra so that you can learn about the artwork the tapestries the furniture and the construction.

A Treasure,October 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Lori M,"I have driven by this place for years when coming to Miami. This time, I decided to visit- it’s a real treasure and an outstanding piece of Miami history. The home, gardens, and view of Biscayne Bay are truly amazing!"
abit of european style architecture,September 2019,40,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Monique F,cafeteria pretty decent
Great Views! ,November 2019,50,Ocean Drive,kathryn388,Such a beautiful street to take a long stroll on. Classic Miami/South Beach architecture and colors. Views of the ocean and beaches.
Loved visiting,November 2019,50,Ocean Drive,tripping10,Especially moved by seeing where Gianni Versace was murdered. Sad to see that location exploited as a raw fish eatery. But the buzz of Ocean Drive is all I expected. Police on every corner. Rainbow colored cross walks. Art Deco hotels. Many smells of cannabis and fried meat. A great location for visiting the past.
You will come here at some point.,November 2019,40,Collins Avenue,yota7,"Shopping, bars and restaurants.  You will come here at some point be it for food, drinks or just walking to get somewhere!  "

Strolling Collins Ave.,June 2019,30,Collins Avenue,Scott P,This is probably one of the more famous streets in Miami Beach the late Arthur Godfrey immortalized. There are many tourist shops here where one can buy postcards and maps as well as noticing the number of retired people who live here. 
Nice area ,November 2019,40,Collins Avenue,waheedz_13,This road is full of eateries pubs and food place of all nations.Also found Halal Indian food but unbelievably expensive. There were some affordable places also unlike ocean drive

Peaceful Place,September 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Julia D,"This is a beautiful and peaceful place to visit whether on your own, with family or friends.  Winter or spring is the best time to visit, but we just got back in September and it was fantastic.  The grounds are beautiful and anything near the water is a great experience...this is situated right on the Bay.  Great and inexpensive outing!"
Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,October 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Cardona58,"Very nice tour of the home and gardens. Well worth the trip. I’m many ways it reminds me of Hearst Castle. However, I would say that Hearst Castle has more “purchased” European antiquities. It’s amazing that the home is built on a coral reef!"
Nice Park Area Alongside the Beach,October 2019,40,Lummus Park Beach,TheDealBeans,"This is a nice park area running adjacent to the beach. It is clean and well maintained, has plenty of seating and an exercise area. Lot's of places close by to eat and drink and the ocean just over the brow of the beach front. There was a big entertainment marqee being put up when we were there but we left before the event."
Best sightseen in Miami,December 2019,50,Wynwood Walls,JussiSaa,"Hot day, hot paintings and good wibe. If you like art, visit Wynwood Walls. If you don’t like art, you should definitily visit Wynwood Walls. There is lot different paintings and other stuff too, and it’s free of charge!"

And especially with Lance making it a most wonderful experience!"

Lovely gardens and very interesting house,July 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Helena S,"Something totally different if you are visiting Miami. Stunning gardens, beautifully laid out. Loads of butterflies, iguanas and colourful lizards darting across your path. Areas of steamy mangrove swamps. Right on the ocean. Beautiful place to wander and soak up the views and the sunshine.  Inside the house is equally interesting and a great place to wander. I spent almost the whole day there. Limited cafe facilities but enough choice to suit most people."
"Beautiful!  If you have been to San Simeon, this is better!",January 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,ToTellTheTruthHonest,"What a delightful day, and eye-opening experience!  Take the tour with the docent-they will point out so many things you will miss without a guide!  "
Beautiful!,April 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Paradise700506,"Gorgeous place, well worth seeing. We declined the tour and later regretted it. Definitely worth seeing."
A must visit for the east coast if you love history and homes combined.,May 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Katrina P,A must see if you have wanted to or have visit Hearst Castle on the west coast and the gilded mansions on the upper east coast.  These home represented the influence of Europe while making their own way as they used their wealth to leave an amazing impact on just a small part of some of our most amazing coastlines in our country.
Beautiful oasis,December 2018,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,FlaTravlers,"Vizcaya is a wonderful historic house with lovely gardens and an excellent view over Biscayne Bay. The contents of the house are fairly interesting, but in certain ways the outdoors area is even more of an attraction. For that reason I wouldn’t visit in a heavy downpour."
Awesome Zoo!,October 2018,50,Zoo Miami,Cszepak,"Really nice zoo to go with family, small kids, etc... nice infra-structure with food, restaurants, etc... rent a 4-seat or 6-seat bike to go, the place is quite big. Try to avoid the hottest summer days."
"Great bars, restaurants and shopping",November 2019,50,Lincoln Road,Jetscot,I love the vibe in Lincoln Road. So many cool bars with outdoor seating. I can leave my husband exploring them while I shop. We have eaten in several different restaurants.  All very casual. 
Girls trip,November 2019,50,Lincoln Road,347jackie,"shopping was great , great selection of shops and some great places to eat .. A great place to eat is the Time Out Market..."
Great place if you are in South Beach Miami,December 2019,40,Lincoln Road,Lidia90049,"Pedestrian street with a mixture of restaurants, small shops, tattoo parlors, convenience stores and street souvenir vendors. Outdoor tables under umbrellas, Festive atmosphere  and well attended at night. I only walk 2 blocks and had a french brunch at Paul bought a shirt at Zara chose a Spanish restaurant for dinner and view a couple of Botero sculptures."
Lots of tacky ,December 2019,30,Lincoln Road,GuyoftheGlobe,Sadly Lincoln road was just another street with many of the same shops selling low quality to Americans. Three of the same coffee chain in two blocks - WTF! A few local shops and the atmosphere made it bearable. One visit is more than enough. Enjoy the architecture as that is another redeeming feature.
An historic gem,October 2019,40,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,frand776,"My husband and I enjoyed touring this monument to a bygone era when wealthy industrialists built mansions as retreats from the cold and pressures of life in the north and Midwest. Not unlike the Isabel Stewart Gardner house in Boston, Vizcaya was designed as a one-of-a-kind “pleasure dome” and personal vision of its owner and is filled with art and gardens. There is no access for baby strollers so we had to keep close watch on the toddler in our party. It also seems to be a popular spot for weddings. Adjacent to the main building is a small snack bar that sells souvenirs. "
A must while in Miami,December 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,alexa772018,"Besides it’s beautiful beaches, Miami has much more to offer like Vizcaya. Always amazing and more so during December holidays with all the decorations! In addition, the weather is not to hot at this time of the year, so taking a nice stroll at the gardens is a big plus and nice place for family’s punctures!"
Better then expected,December 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,MTV524,"Great tours, beautiful grounds, friendly staff, and very well kept. We were there 3 hours and it flew by so quickly. Well worth the money."
Excellent,December 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Storyteller704481,Excellent your guide for $5.  Spent 3.5 hours there. Learned so much about Vizcaya and the owner Mr. Deering. Grounds are beautifully maintained. 
A Miami gem,December 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,lynzk2016,A must do for any Miami resident or visitor. So many beautiful things to see in the house and around the spacious grounds.
Fantastic buildings.,December 2019,40,Art Deco Historic District,K254CFtimp,"Really enjoyed walking round this area where the buildings are gorgeous and mostly well preserved especially at nighttime where the lighting is well used to maximise this distinctive look. My only issue with the area, Ocean drive, is the great looking bars really do take advantage with the prices they charge, maybe best to enjoy the views then head back uptown to actually eat."
Amazing getaway from busy Miami.,August 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Garfield077,"Must see when visiting the area. We stood in FLL before, but this is the first time we found out about Vizcaya. What an amazing place! Could have spend days in the house and gardens. Again: Must See!!!!"
Wow!,August 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Rockabird,"If you like living museums and interesting history, this is the place.  A place of wonder and amazing artifacts. As we walked through it, it was hard to imagine compiling such an extensive collection in one place.  Definitely a worthwhile place to stop and spend a few hours. "
Venice in Miami,August 2019,30,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,AmandaBLV,"The Vizcaya estate is an eclectic plethora of European art, decor and architecture. I didn’t do any research before visiting other than a few Google searches and was expecting a bit more of an authentic Spanish estate. The estate is only about 100 years old (if that old) and is a Chicago magnates collection of European artifacts. The grounds and gardens are like little Venice and then you look up to see the Miami skyline. Highly recommend the orchid garden, it was just delightful with types of orchids we’d never seen before and butterflies fluttering about. Very sweet. The grounds are much more interesting than the house. This was a very convenient tour. And a nice way to spend a couple of hours in Miami. It’s definitely off the beaten path and shows you there’s more to Miami then sun and beaches. We went on a Saturday and it was pretty crowded."
What a find!,August 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,haraschambers,"We were looking for somewhere to go on a shorty afternoon and found this amazing place. It was the most beautiful house demonstrating all European cultural history in one place. Added bonus was the orchid collection, the man gives, lizards and butterflies. So glad we found it; I never expected anything like this in Miami."
Beautiful home,August 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,Joshua K,"We visited while in town with family during the summer. Beautiful gardens, home, an furnishings. The house is a close to Calle Ocho and other great areas in Miami to visit. Definitely worth visiting while in town."

Another lovly place in Miami Beach.,July 2019,50,South Pointe Park,monicabjorkhaug,"This is as far south you can get on Miami Beach.

Beautiful in the sunset, but also during the daytime."
"Fun, Chill place to watch cruise ships",September 2019,50,South Pointe Park,shaunab90,"In my free time, I like to watch cruise ships sail away via online webcams. I was in Miami early for a cruise, so I decided to watch them sail away in person. The park is very clean and very relaxing."

"Great spot to watch the sunset, cruise ships and people watch",November 2019,50,South Pointe Park,lexie1277,"So glad we made the trek to this park. Beautiful place for walking, biking and dog walking. Amazing views especially at sunset. Walkways, grassy areas, little nooks and crannies to explore, watch the yachts and cruise ships coming in and out of the port. Beautiful fountains lit up at night. From there we started our journey up Ocean Drive where the neon and nightlife come alive. Great time."
nice setup,December 2019,40,South Pointe Park,fabrim,"I liked walking on the pathway starting from ocean drive and then following along the beach all the way down to South Pointe, perfect also for a nice and easy jog. The view there is quite spectacular.  "

Fabulous,July 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,David B,"I'd heard this was a beautiful house and garden, but was thrilled to experience it in person.

On a bright, sweaty summer day the gardens are a little intense to explore, but there are shady spots and wonderful surprises to discover. 100 percent recommended for architecture and history enthusiasts. Some areas of the house and gardens will be challenging to access for people with limited mobility."

Loved the wild iguanas and lizards roaming in the gardens!,July 2019,50,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens,WencyB,We came in early so there’s no line at the ticket counter.

Nice place for walking your pets,March 2019,40,Miami Beach Boardwalk,yvetd2019,My hotel has access to the boardwalk with beach umbrellas/chairs for a fee so that was pretty awesome.  The time I visited there was an ongoing construction of what looks like extending the boardwalk
Spectacular ,November 2019,50,Miami Beach Boardwalk,NYCtoFL,"My hotel in South Beach offered bikes so after 20 years I took a chance at biking again. We biked all along the trails which lead to the board walk in one direction and a pier in the other. I was stunned by the pristine, manicured trails and boardwalk. We went each morning after that which was like a vacation of it’s own."

Relaxing Under The Shade,June 2019,40,Lummus Park Beach,Scott P,Lummus Park Beach is a place to relax from the hot sun and there is a cool breeze that comes from the palm trees. The park is maintained by groundskeepers who make sure the park is well manicured and that water sprinklers keep the grass green. There is always a chance to get a spray from the water sprinklers which is a relief from the humid air.
