Recently renovated Frank Lloyd Wright Home,gaylem113,"This gem is located within the University of Chicago campus, offering tours and special events.  Besides the house, there are examples of Frank Lloyd Wright furniture.  Stop in to see a rare example of Wright's work.",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,November 2019,50
Great quick stop,Zingbot,"We did not book a tour so we were only able to view the lobby, which is stunning. There are a few signs describing the history of the building. We spent maybe ten minutes looking at the ceiling and staircase. Well worth the stop. I'm looking forward to booking a tour sometime to see the rest.",The Rookery Building,September 2019,50
BEAUTIFUL OASIS...,ltbody,"...and it’s FREE... with a suggested donation of $10 per adult and $5 per child. Very tranquil, and meditative by the Koi pond. I spent a couple hours meandering around. Afterwards go to Inspiration Kitchens nearby for a yummy bite ;-) ",Garfield Park Conservatory,August 2019,50
"Free to stop in, though not much for understanding the space",Jenny_in_Palo_Alto,"Also, pro-tip, there's a Potbelly Sandwich shop that has a tremendous view of the Light Court, so you can have a cheap tasty sandwich while enjoying the architecture.",The Rookery Building,July 2019,50
A day in Chicago,Donna S,We enjoyed the Silver Screen display of gowns worn in the movies desigh8by Chanel and Valentino and a tour of Chicago Blues exhibit.,Chicago History Museum,August 2019,40
Great sound - be aware of being close to stage on floor,WaterboyGA,Heard from ALL the locals and drivers that the place is hell trying to catch a ride and fight traffic back.  We left with one song to go and were glad we did.,United Center,July 2019,40
In need of some major updating,mmjtr,"I bought a Groupon for the 4 of us. After visitng, I know now why they were offering a Groupon. Some of the exhibits are in great need of an update. We watched the film that was about Chicago's history. It was very hokey but the theater was pretty. The fashion exhibit was the best part. I was just expecting something more grand since Chicago is such a large city with a rich history. ",Chicago History Museum,July 2019,20
Way to travel,MukeshDave,Very convenient way of travelling in Chicago by public transport and runs across Chicago. Very fast and easy way to connect to airport,The Loop,May 2019,50
Amplified,869Sabrina,"I went specifically for amplified and it’s a really well done exhibit. It’s very interactive, enough that children were exploring which is important ",Chicago History Museum,June 2019,50
Late afternoon visit = no queues ,Fizzy101,We were lucky and didnt have any queues really the longest wait was about 10mins to step on the sky deck another visitor said they had waited over 2hrs the day before earlier in the day about lunch time we arrived after 4pm the sky deck area itself is quite small,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,October 2019,40
Lots of Interesting facts about Chicago,matmul45,There were many interesting displays and artifacts of interest. I felt it was a bit pricey. Some of the interactive displays were not working.  I did learn a lot about the city and enjoyed seeing the fashions of the 40's and 50's by Chicago designers. There were also many artifacts from the fire and bygone days that were of interest.,Chicago History Museum,May 2019,30
Superb from the planetarium !,139nathaliep,If you visit the planetarium or the Field museum you will enjoy the best Chicago skyline view from far away. If you want to be immersed into Chicago river of buildings you can enjoy the architecture cruise on Navy Pier which is a must for architecture lovers ! Either way is top notch ! Chicago is beautiful !,Chicago Skyline,August 2019,50
Interesting,Go2theZoo,"We went on what we thought was a free day, but apparently we missed the part about that only being for Illinois residents. We decided to stay, as the cashier told us he could give a better price than what was listed. It was $14 for the adults and $12 for my daughter, a student rate. There were lots of interesting exhibits. We didn't know much about Chicago history except for the gangster stuff. We really enjoyed seeing the things connected to President Lincoln and the items that are made in Chicago. The music stuff was very interesting, as well as the train car from the World's Fair. The history of the city's beginnings was interesting to read. We enjoyed the couple of hours we spent here.",Chicago History Museum,April 2019,40
Good little snapshot of the city ,AnneENeill,"Compared to many attractions which are around the $25/$30 mark,  this place is a little cheaper at $19. I found it good value. It’s a meandering, exhibit based museum over two floors which captures all significant events in the city’s history. There was a good photographic/text display on Martin LK which was highly interesting. The best thing was a special exhibition on Hollywood fashions on main street which contained about 30 mannequins wearing beautiful gowns from the war/inter war era. It’ll delight any woman or man who loves that American Dream era. Took me 2 hours to get round, though I’d planned to spend only an hour or so, because I genuinely was enjoying it.",Chicago History Museum,April 2019,50
Super views from the river or Navy Pier,MIke23693,"The skyline is very attractive, especially as viewed from river cruise that go out to lake Locke or from the Navy Pier.",Chicago Skyline,July 2019,50
Wonderful Dog Park,CarolAnneRose,"GREAT DOG PARK! I can't thank the man that made this place a reality enough!!! Buddy Guy absolutely loves running, playing and socializing here. A much needed area for dogs on the South Side! Can't wait to see Jackson Bark grow with the pup families in the area!",Jackson Bark - Dog Park,April 2015,50
Come and see the Blue's Exhibit!,crunch6,Come and learn how the blues migrated up to Chicago and the famous musicians that created their music here.  This is also an excellent museum to learn about the history of Chicago.,Chicago History Museum,March 2019,50
Wonderful Visit,MajG406,Ihad the best time at this visit to a Chicago specific museum. The exhibits were well done and well thought out to be done. Highlty recommended. Bus 151 from Wrigley building.,Chicago History Museum,March 2019,50
Skyline,seemti,The skyline is so beautiful. It gives you a unique experience if you have the chance to watch it from Michigan lake. ,Chicago Skyline,July 2019,50
interesting concept,jeffrey k,"eventually, I hope this museum can move to a larger space.  I wanted more.....",American Writers Museum,November 2018,40
Walking tour,Rosemarie C,"Besides the exhibits, please make sure you do a walking tour that is offered with your admission to the museum. That really made the visit worth while. Check the schedule, there are a variety of walking tours offered.",Chicago History Museum,October 2018,40
Great day out at museum with a friend,Ranadhir S,Great museum to learn about American history. Got a free pass with BOFA museum days. Especially liked the Martin Luther King section.,Chicago History Museum,July 2018,50
Learning for the entire family,Deepti111,So many exhibits from so many times of our history. They have got Egyptians exhibits several times . They do several special events for their members. Rex has been here for a long time. So are the mummies,Chicago History Museum,June 2018,50
Impressive and Interactive ,RondaKansasCity,"The collections and displays are very interesting, impressive and educational. Visitors are encouraged to touch, and with good reason...much can be learned by turning compartments, pulling knobs and touching screens. Overall, this is a wonderful and fascinating place.",American Writers Museum,September 2018,50
It’s very proud of Chicago,Tim G,"Two floors of galleries, most interesting though a bit too gloomy on the lighting levels for my eyes, making captions rather difficult to read.  The content is good, and the pride in their city and people comes across in bucketsful.  As a railway enthusiast I was astonished to find the old Baldwin loco Pioneer, but there is so little information provided.  I had to read Wikipedia afterwards!  I was museumed-out after an hour and half, but there’s enough to see for a couple of hours.  Don’t miss it.",Chicago History Museum,January 2019,40
Very educatonal,Illinoisnow,"Very well put together displays about:Chicago Fire, Blues,the 'streamline' movement. My only complaint is that it is so dim you can't see the descriptions and WHY do so many museums make the printing so small?  I could not see many of them. ",Chicago History Museum,December 2018,40
Yes!,Richard L,"You must make this place a priority, to get a good idea of old Chicago. Excellent museum with lots of interactive items for kids.",Chicago History Museum,September 2018,50
"One of the original ""Skyscapers""",Ray S,"Built after the Chicago Fire of 1871, dating from around 1880, the interior is an excellent example of architecture and unparalled craftsmanship",The Rookery Building,November 2017,50
Major renovations underway,daviddclarke,"Robie House is in the middle of a major renovation. To make the tour more relevant I think They need to adjust their talking program & describe the tour as if you were a delivery person coming thru the service entrance to make a delivery. You definitely are not coming to the front door to be greeted and ushered in as a guest. The entrance, Foyer, billiard room, & the main staircase to the living room are all closed for extensive renovations. You enter the house thru the auto garage courtyard to visit the empty nursery  and end up going up the back servants staircase to arrive at a guest bedroom before then being shuffled into the empty dining room  & kitchen. The rest of the house feels very empty except for a few FLW designed chairs. most major rooms are closed. They house is a masterpiece but I'd say for the next few years go because with your entrance fee you are helping them with the enormous cost they need to raise for the renovations but I would also plan to go again after 2019 when I think they said they will have the house reopened. The coffee shop in a university building  right beside the front door of the house is a great place to eat before or after your tour.",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,April 2018,30
"If you love literature, then you are in for a treat!",Kathy B,"We heard about this little gem of a museum through a librarian friend. It is nicely done and much thought went into each interactive display. The cost of admission was a little high but understandable. Out of our party of 4; one person finished in 36 minutes, one in 75 minutes, and 2 people took over 120 minutes. Two suggestions would be to have a handout of the books and authors displayed, and to have the books featured available to buy. Overall a great addition to the museums in Chicago.",American Writers Museum,September 2018,40
very interesting,francois b,"If you are no specialist , you learn a lot in a nice way .....If you are , you will have lot to think , approve or criticize !",American Writers Museum,August 2018,50
Refreshing walk,TravelKat21,There was still free street parking when we arrived around 8:15am on a Sunday. It was difficult to find any open spots after 10am. ,Lincoln Park Conservatory,July 2018,50
Great in spring,Peter T,"Lots of things to see, zoo is amazing, even having talk sessions.  The ducks and turtles in the pond are amazing as are the black birds with the red tips who have a nice trill sound.",Lincoln Park,May 2018,50
Nice Nature Break in Chicago,Thomas S,"Great spot for a walk on a sunny day.  There are many things to do including a zoo.  Sometimes there are vendors selling local produce.  Good for relaxing, people watching and just taking a pleasant meander.",Lincoln Park,May 2018,40
Ice Skating Magic,Amychuck,"We loved skating on the ice-skating ribbon.  It really is a magical experience.  We don't have ice-skating ribbons where we are from in Texas (due to weather) and it is so much more fun than skating around an oval rink.  The price is reasonable and the condition of the ice is kept quite well considering the number of people.  The Christmas music playing and the beauty of the lights of the city make this all the more magical.  Even though we had to wait for the zamboni machine, there were plenty of places to sit inside where it was warm to wait.  This really gets the season started for our family during our annual visit to Chicago. Even better, our daughter has basically learned to ice skate quite quickly after just one visit a year to the ribbon for the past couple of years. It would be neat to see the geometrical climbing walls there accessed during the summer months. It is almost like skating around sculptures.",Maggie Daley Park,December 2018,50
History,Dellian M,"We bought the city pass, it gave us access to almost everything in the museum. We ran short with time and it’s definitely an all day kinda museum but it’s rich in history. Highly recommend.",Chicago History Museum,November 2018,50
Interesting look at Chicago's history,T C,"This museum provides an interesting glimpse of Chicago's history and blues tradition. Other exhibits that were there during our visit highlighted Martin Luther King and streamlined design. Our gold standard among city museums is the one in London, England, which is superb. The museum is very good, but not in the same league as London's. We're glad we visited, but do not have a burning desire to return.",Chicago History Museum,November 2018,40
Fantastic!,Jarch98,I took the audio-guide which was entertaining to listen too but also helpful in the where to go next kind of way. ,Chicago History Museum,December 2018,50
Spring vacation,Jerry S,Wonderful city. Beautiful buildings and parks downtown. Nice atmosphere and lots of places to eat. The weather was good and we walked around from the shoreline to the inner city.,Chicago Skyline,April 2019,50
Live. Work. Play. In The Loop.,iambenjamin,"The Loop has everything imaginable that you could need, all within walking distance or just a short L ride away. Theater, shopping, restaurants, parks, and attractions, there is always something to see, experience, eat, and enjoy. I've been impressed with how clean The Loop is and how active it has become over the last few years. It feels safe and is a great place to live, work and play. ",The Loop,March 2018,50
Loop!!!!,CathyP1953,"We took the Big Bus Tour today and drove along The Loop!!! Fascinating and interesting places to see along The Loop.  I had always heard of The Loop, but really did not know what it was until my travels today.  Loved my tour of The Loop!!!",The Loop,April 2018,50
Great day for a good time ,briansC2742SN,"Went to Garfield Park and had a wonderful time! When you walk up, you see it’s big - but it is WAY bigger than it seems. I cannot believe how much there is to see. Make sure you go to the ponds outside! ",Garfield Park Conservatory,August 2018,50
Great history,BobKop,"This restored building has some great history to it. With originally restored mosaic floors this is a beautiful building. Our Chicago Greeter took us here and explained some of the back story. If you don't have a greeter with you, there are signs with information in the lobby (anybody can enter). It is defenitely worth taking a look at for a few minutes if you are around.",Reliance Building,February 2012,40
Great Place,PilotHouse,"First trip to Chicago for the national restaurant show. Booked our stay on line at the Burnham and could not have been happier. The staff were friendly, informative and very helpful. The building itself is fabulous. Rooms were very comfortable. Will return again.",Reliance Building,May 2012,40
Elegant and well preserved,erster,"I've stayed in most of the Kimpton hotels in Chicago, and the Burnham is by far the most beautiful.  This wonderful and important historic building has been thoughtfully and carefully restored with remarkably little compromise, and it now functions beautifully as an upscale hotel.  My room had touches of sumptuous elegance in the Kimpton signature style.  It was small but cozy (as opposed to  rooms elsewhere that are small and unbearably cramped).  I had a fabulous view of State Street, with the Marshall Fields store on the left and down a block the Carson-Pirie Scott store.  In spite of the fact that it looked out on a very busy street, the room was quiet and peaceful.  Great location, steps from the El, Millennium Park, and just about every central attraction in downtown Chicago.  Excellent service, too.  Did not try the restaurant, since it was closed for Labor Day. But I arrived just in time for the evening wine tasting, which was a pleasant welcome after a long trip.",Reliance Building,September 2012,50
Would stay here again in a heartbeat!,Dale H,"My daughter and I stayed here the night before the Chicago Marathon.  The hotel is beautiful and service is excellent.  We arrived early (before noon) yet were immediately checked in.  We were given a choice of a king or two doubles.  Chose the doubles.  The front staff was professional, efficient, and patiently answered all my questions.  The room was great!  The beds had beautiful sheer canopies.  The toiletries were nice.  I was able to join their In-Touch Program for free for free wi-fi during our stay.  Bonus for the marathoners: at 5 A.M. in the morning they had complimentary coffee, bagels and peanut butter, bananas, and water available.  My daughter watched the elite runners run by from our room window.  Unfortunately, they could not provide late check out for runners but we did check our baggage there.  But talking to other runners, I don't know of any hotel that offered this.  When returning to Chicago for another visit, I will definitely consider the Burnham Hotel again!",Reliance Building,October 2012,50
Great restoration,ScottyG777,"This building is famous architecturally, and it's destined to be famous for the great, chic hotel that has opened here a few years ago.  I remember this building well from my architecture college days and it was a blast to stay here this past summer.  Luckily, a client was paying because it's not cheap, but it's very, very cool.  If nothing else, visit the cool lobby area and eat at the great restaurant.  ",Reliance Building,August 2012,50
"The ""Hill Street Blues"" police station on the National Register for Historic Places",Allen21096,"From 1981 through 1986, how many of us listened to a familiar refrain on NBC once a week as police cars pulled out of the ""Hill Street"" police station at Hill St. (fictional street) & Morgan St.  The station was manned by characters like Capt. Furillo, Bobby Hill, Mick Belker, Andy Renko, J.D. LaRue, Sgt. Phil Esterhaus and more.  That TV show had 144 episodes over that time period.  But many did not know that the ""Hill Street"" police station had actually been the Maxwell Street station at the corner of Maxwell St. & Morgan St.  When the station was first built in 1888, it was home to the Chicago Police Department's 7th District.  Over the years, the district became known as ""Bloody Maxwell"" or  “the Wickedest Police District in the World”.  The station which anchored the western end of the Maxwell Street Market quieted down after Prohibition ended, but in the 1960's and 1970's, it became home to the Area Four Detective Division.  Area Four had the most murders out of the six detective areas of the City of Chicago.  When the new police station at the corner of Harrison St. and Kedzie Ave. opened, Area Four moved its headquarters there.  When I was promoted to detective and assigned, I was assigned to Area Four, but missed the honor of working out of the Maxwell St. police station.  The station itself is Romanesque in style and is architecturally significant as an example of pre-1945 police stations in Chicago.  It was designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Franklin Pierce Burnham.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.   Besides the iconic ""Hill Street Blues"" television show, the exterior was also used for the television show - ""Chicago P.D.""  In 1998, the City of Chicago vacated the station and after extensive renovations, the station became home to the University of Illinois - Chicago (UIC) Police Department.",Maxwell Street Station,June 2017,50

Go Chicago Card so many choices and worth the money,lindae5603,"Had a jam packed weekend in Chicago using the Chicago Go Card.  The card offered so many options.  There are other passes like the city pass, but it does not offer the variety you get with the Go Card.  We got to skip the long lines at the Shedd and Field museum with the card, which always help to save time.  ",Illinois Center,July 2013,50
Soo cute and fun ,Steffffxx,"Had a great time, very clean and the cats were great. They have great merchandise too. I have nothing else to say besides that it’s good. ",The Catcade,July 2019,50
Home To Local Chicago Artists and Their Art,Deborah M,"This building is an 88,000 square feet space filled will artists and their artwork.  Every first Friday of the month (evenings) the public can come to visit their spaces.  Don't wait for the Coyote Arts Festival in September to visit this great artists' space.  This is a historic and architecturally important space in the Wicker Park neighborhood.  Most of the artwork is very reasonably priced (no middle person / gallery owners).   Check out the great website for more information.",Flat Iron Arts Building,September 2011,50
Fun afternoon on a Sunday ,Jeri D,Amazing and Fun Filled.  All the seats are pretty good.  It's at a location which is easy parking plus a kid friendly environment yet still good for adults.,Atheneum Theatre Chicago,September 2016,50

A little slice of Italy,Nicole H,If you're staying in the Gold Coast stroll over to this little slice and enjoy an espresso or gelato and watch the people. It's a quaint little park.,Mariano Plaza,July 2015,40
Take a class here!,jaz79h,"We came here for a class on ""face mugs""--mugs that have a caricature-like face on them. Lillstreet set up a short, fun slide show on the subject, and then gave us materials and instruction to make our own. So much fun! There's amazing classes of all sorts. A small exhibition/sales space downstairs. A really sweet restaurant (especially for pie). What a hoot!",Lillstreet Art Center,February 2017,40

"A knockout, beautiful church!",Chris B,"I honestly don't know how often or when the church is open to visitors (outside of worship services of course.)  I was able to get inside with a local friend in between services.  The church is just wonderfully gorgeous inside.  About 100 years old.  The barrel vaulted nave is done in a delicate pale blue with gold accents, beautiful stenciling, and very traditional-style murals/icons.  Very striking in effect, with a massive bronze chandelier hanging from the central dome.  If you can pop in during ""open hours"" I would recommend it.  (Please leave a donation, as big old churches like this need, as architectural treasures from our past, all the upkeep help they can get!)",St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral,October 2013,50
Neat and cheap,isabelc959,"I was looking for a place to stay with my husband to spend a 2 week vacation. We found this place. Pros: location, cleanliness, doorman, reception. Cons: my bed was too small! My husband weights over 100 kg and I weight about 90 kg. Both of us are tall. The bed had just 130 cm, hardly enough to fit us both, specially since at home we share a king size bed!",Old Colony Building,July 2017,30
Terrible experience,SUSAN P,"This short-stay apartment rental is a complete rip-off--avoid! My room had no curtains on the windows, the bed was a queen-sized rollaway cot with one sheet and one thin blanket, the floor was stained, the kitchen had pots and pans, but no dishes, and the building is full of noisy college students. When I called the number provided for assistance, I was told that they couldn't help me and that  ""curtains were not a service they provide."" The calls to their service center kept dropping and I finally asked where they were--the answer was Armenia. I called Expedia and demanded to be relocated immediately. The whole episode cost me stress and a fair amount of money. I am appalled that Expedia listed this group on their website along with legitimate hotels.",Old Colony Building,September 2015,10
Good value,pmartin172,"After stopping here for two nights I found this clean and tidy, a little noisy but only to be expected in the heart of the city.  Great roof terrace for bbq or watch tv out in the open air.   Views of the lake in the distance.  2 couples sharing with kitchen great little stop.   Shortage of crockery was the only issue.    Fully air conditioned. ",Old Colony Building,June 2016,30
AirB&B'ed it for 4 days in CHI-town,Travel4evermore,"Old building - nice apartment though.  The gym is great and for sure you will need to check out the roof-top.  View of the city with nice little tables, gas grills and a pool table.  ",Old Colony Building,July 2016,40
Bathroom flooded from leak in above ceiling,Jamie K,"We had low expectations for splitting a two-bedroom apartment for a girls' weekend so were pleasantly surprised with the cool apartment, though sparse, handy kitchen for keeping breakfast foods, and fun rooftop with great views and hang out areas.  It allowed us to be affordably walkable to Soldier Field for returning from a concert.  On our last morning we heard rushing water above the bathroom before water started leaking through the ceiling. We learned the apartment above had been vacant and supposedly fixed but remaining closed, which raises lots of questions about an even worse plumbing problem.  I also had respiratory issues only while in the apartment, which is concerning to me.",Old Colony Building,June 2017,30
Stunning,CultureHunter,"After the service was over one of the church members gave me a private little tour, she explained the meaning of the icons and gave me a brief history of the building. She did mention that people are free to stop in during certain times of the week so long as they are respectful. Even if you are not religious, stop in here simply to see the architecture and take in the beauty of this Cathedral. I highly recommend this place, and hope to visit again soon.",St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral,November 2013,50

"Great time, clean bathrooms and no lines",traveller347,"This was a great way to see the cubs play ball. I bought this as a groupon so we paid only $65.00 a ticket. I did see that games are discounted for only $75.00 especially day games during the mid week for lesser teams like the Diamond Back.  We were supposed to be at 3717 but they were full and redirected to 3737 Sheffield this had the most comfortable ball park seats I have ever experienced and better beer on tap like Heinekin. If you are into better food you can splurge and get the vip upgrade and get into the rooftop earlier and have alcohol until the 9th inning..Not really for young kids though. Its much warmer, got sunburned We had a great time and it was so quick to get out of the stadium and into the subway to get back to the hotel. The only downside was there was a giveaway and you do not qualify for the giveaway.",Skybox on Sheffield,April 2014,50
No view,AMK1124,"You CAN NOT see the game from the top two outdoor levels of this venu. I think there may be a partial view from the interior first floor of the venu, through the windows.  DO NOT buy tickets at this location if you have any intention of actually watching the game.  It seems Wrigley Field erected a huge billboard between the date we bought our tickets in April (and we did much research looking for view images online at the time) and the date we actually arrived for game time. So very very disappointed.  Food and booze is satisfactory.",Skybox on Sheffield,May 2015,10

Wendell's Chicago Water Taxi,Grandma47,"Took from Madison Avenue, near Amtrak station where we arrived, to Michigan Avenue, walked two blocks to our hotel.  $2.50 senior rate.

A Bit of Chicago History!,patshea2016,"401 N. Michigan Building.  Chicago’s founder, Jean Baptiste Pointe de Sable is believed to have lived where the Tribune Tower is located.  A fur trader, John Kinzie, is believed to have lived in this area as well.  Pioneer Court was built in 1965. It was built to honor our city’s founder and other pioneers like John Kinzie who settled in the area.  This is a great place for tourists to gather.  Tickets for boat rides on the Chicago River were being sold while I was there.  Pioneer Court has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

Inspirational service on Sunday,C-Z-1982,"I guess this church is not one of Chicago's most prominent ones (there are indeed some beautiful churches in Chicago), not would it seem to be a middle/high class neighborhood. But sometimes you need to take a gamble and we did. Looking at our map, we had a few choices, but St Malachy was really closest by. A little hesitant we approached the church and were warmly welcomed by parishioners (not that many) and the pastor. First the church is actually really nice, old, and old-fashioned, but well maintained and warm, with some nice statutes of saints. The service was actually inspiring, a great choir (mixture of traditional catholic and southern baptist music), and above all a truly remarkable homily. This  Sunday the gospel tells us the story of the young boy with who had five small loaves and two fish and Jesus performing the miracle of feeding the people AND when all was said and done, there were leftovers, filling 12 baskets. The pastor focused on the 12 baskets. Who he wondered would think of bringing empty baskets with them to this gathering? A great and moving homily. Would certainly recommend this church.",St. Malachy and Precious Blood Church,July 2018,40

The last time we ate there we had our 4 kids with us (9, 7 and 5 at the time) and it went very well.  The owners told us they have a child and they have a ridiculously inexpensive children's menu to accomodate kids.  It is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago.

It's not marked in any way and is up a long stairwell to the side of another restaurant.  This venue has different shows each night of the week.  Some nights is burlesque, some nights magic tricks, some nights jazz and soul.  Some acts are stronger than other.

Where the Cubs last won the World Series,Taylor B,"West Side Grounds, or West Side Park, was the home field of the Chicago Cubs baseball team from 1893 to 1915. It was located at the intersection of South Wolcott Avenue and West Polk Street on Chicago's West Side. The Cubs won four National League pennants from 1906 to 1910 and two World Series championships in 1907 and 1908. They haven't won a World Series since then. Today, the site is the University of Illinois Medical Center. But baseball fans and other visitors can tour the site and envision where the field that once held more than 20,000 fans for baseball games once stood. A plaque commemorating the park was placed in front of the University of Illinois Chicago Neuro Psychiatric Institute at 912 South Wood in 2009. Remember, this is the park where the double play combination of Tinker to Evers to Chance was immortalized. The grandstand from home plate to left field ran parallel to West Polk. The first base grandstand ran parallel to South Wolcott. Nothing remains of the park but much of the outfield area remains a park in the middle of the University of Illinois medical complex. The park can is accessed from an entrance near the corner of West Taylor and South Wood behind the University of Illinois Biologic Resources Laboratory. Home plate was in the northwest corner of the field, at the intersection of Polk and Lincoln. The right field fence paralleled Taylor. Cook County Hospital was across the street to the north, behind third base. The foul lines were originally reported to be 340 feet while the deepest part of center field was 560 feet. The original grandstand was reported to be double-decked. By the early 1910s, the wooden structure began to show its age and found itself competing unsuccessfully with the new steel-and-concrete baseball venues, such as the Chicago White Sox' Comiskey Park, which was inaugurated in 1910. In 1915, Charles Weeghman purchased a substantial interest in the Cubs. One of his first acts was to abandon West Side Grounds and move the Cubs to Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. Weeghman Park survives today as Wrigley Field. West Side Grounds continues to host semipro and amateur baseball games for a few years. It even served as a setting for Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show. The park was torn down in 1920.",West Side Grounds,December 2014,50

I've done theatre before, and improv is not easy, so I was impressed with their performance.  I even had the opportunity to go onstage as one of the audience volunteers, which added to the fun.

Only ten footsteps away from the Chicago northside Berwyn Red Line stop, this small, award-winning theatre (60 very comfortable seats) provides an emotional punch with each and every show.  If you live here, the $80 season pass (4 shows) is a no-brainer.  If you're visiting, unsure of what to see, and want to experience the type of theatre for which Chicago is renowned,  a quick trip on the Red Line and $20 (or less, on hottix) will give you a great memory and a good story to tell your friends when you get home.",Steep Theatre Co,April 2016,50

What's Alexander Hamilton doing in Lincoln Park?,Taylor B,"There is a monument to Abraham Lincoln located in Lincoln Park. But there is a statue of Ulysses S. Grant in Lincoln Park, not Grant Park. And there is a statue of William Shakespeare in Grant Park and a statue of Alexander Hamilton in Lincoln Park. Go figure. How did Hamilton, who had absolutely no ties to Chicago, end up in Lincoln Park, at 2045 North Lincoln Park West, south of West Diversey Parkway, west of North Cannon Drive and east of North Stockton Drive? Philanthropist and art patron Kate Sturges Buckingham is best known for donating the Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain in Grant Park. But she also commissioned the monument to Hamilton, whom she felt was ""one of the least appreciated great Americans."" She believed Hamilton, who served as the United States' first Secretary of the Treasury, had secured the nation's financial future, allowing her own family to make a fortune in grain elevators and banking. In 1940, she hired artist John Angel to model a figurative sculpture of Hamilton. Finally, the statue was installed in 1952. Today, the gilded bronze statue sits on a simple low granite base, within easy view of pedestrians and drivers from the busy intersection of Diversey, Sheridan Road, Lake View and Cannon Drive on the north edge of Lincoln Park.",Alexander Hamilton Monument,June 2019,50

Typical Improv,jointfilms,"I'll be honest: I'm not a big fan of improv. Sure I'll get a laugh here and there but mostly I find it pales in comparison to stand-up. I did want to check out a comedy show while I was in Chicago and thought about going to Second City since so many people I am fans of were students there early in their career. But a friend who actually does improv suggested I check out TJ & Dave show at the Mission Theater. It's a good deal for a show so popular. Just $10. The show apparently consistently sells out so you might want to get your tickets ahead of time. I think I bought mine a week in advance. The theater squeezes you in like most comedy/improv theaters but it was a little roomier than most. With improv obviously it's always going to be hit or miss. This night felt like a big miss for me. Not many laughs or even interesting stuff going on. Show rambled and seemed very unfocused. Expect that from students just starting out but not seasoned pros. But look again I'm not a big improv fan, the show has to be really good for me to be satisfied and I'll give these guys the benefit of the doubt that they were just having an ""off"" night which happens. Show was an hour but I've heard it can sometimes go longer. There's a large bar area outside theater to mingle in before/after the show. No drink minimum which is good. But there is food and booze served if ya need some.",Mission Theater,July 2016,30

We checked out the Harold Teams Revolver & Denver, as well as Whirled News Tonight Late Edition in the Mission Theater. Laughed throughout the evening in both shows! The content is definitely more adult themed, but my 15 yr old, who's a little more mature, had a blast as well. Beverage & food service is available in all of the theaters, or you can grab it at the bar and bring it in yourself. No outside food is allowed.

Zelda,travelingdoc42,"This was our first time at this theater. It  is  actually  two theaters  in  a single  story corner  building that  used  to  be  a  grocery  store. Our GPS took us  to  its  old  location  (which it  left  14  years  ago) –about  8  blocks  north  of  current  location.  Zelda was (mercifully) in the smaller of the two theaters-which sat only about 55. Only about 30 were at this performance. No  tickets-just  give  them  your name  and  your  program  was  your  ticket. It  was  all  open-seating- first come , first  choice –except  for  two  front  row  center  seats  which  were  reserved  for  a  very  nice  elderly  couple. The  theater was  the  kind  that  had  a stage that  was a flat  concrete  floor  that  you  had  to  walk across the  front  of  to get  to  your  seats.  The walls of the building were clearly visible and formed the stage. Scenery was simple (a piano, a small table w/chair and a bar. Scene  changes (just  flashbacks) were  accomplished  by subtle  lighting  changes  and  the  male  actor  putting  on  a  different  hat  or  a  shawl.  This  was  done  in  a  very  poor  way…in  a  better  production, the  stage  would  have  been totally darkened  and  spotlights  which  allowed only the  two actors  to been  seen would  be  used.  One  male  actor played  all  of  the  parts except  Zelda, including F Scott  Fitzgerald and  two  females: Zelda’s  mother  and dance  teacher. He  wore the same  outfit  ( white  shirt &  slacks )  and  made  no  noticeable attempt  to  change  his  voice  for  each  character. The actress  who  played  Zelda made  almost  no  attempt  to convey Zelda’s looks  or  personality - except  for  a  slight  southern  accent  which  seemed  to  come  and  go. Several  in  the  audience  appeared  to  be  periodically  dosing, including  those  in  my  group.  We probably would have left at intermission - if there was one. The show was   a very long-seeming 55 minutes and is not recommended.",Raven Theatre,August 2015,20
They Had a Hot Show...Really!,RexGermanorium,"We attended the presentation of ""Smartphones"" at the Trap Door Theatre.  You need a urban guide to find the place.  Hole in the wall comes to mind.  There is a slit between two buildings where you walk single file to get to the door.  Once you open the door you think you're in the wrong place.  To the right is the kitchen of a restaurant and to the left looks like a family dining room...is this someone's apartment?  But straight ahead is the door to go into the theater.  The night we were there the playwright was the door man and collected for the two for one ticket.  Two tickets for $20 is hard to beat.  I don't recall him mentioning that the AC was not working too well, if at all.  Maybe on full ticket nights you get full AC.  We purchased some overpriced water which also lacked a coolness one would expect.  The theater has two rows of fairly comfortable velour covered folding theater chairs on two sides.  Seeing is no problem, neither is hearing what's being said.  That night's production was ""Smartphones,"" a very funny outlandish farce about our dependency on smartphones.  The scene with the discussion of what to do with children being solved by outsourcing them to China was hilarious.  The opening operatic spoof let you know what the evening was going to be about.  The slo-mo scene with the flying smartphone was also hilarious.  All the actors did a great job and if it had been cooler, even more enjoyable.",Trap Door Theatre,July 2012,30

"103 years later, the ship's boiler still is visible",Taylor B,"Visiting the shipwreck of the Silver Spray in Chicago isn't comparable to looking at the underwater remains of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. But it's an eerie experience, just the same. On July 15, 1914, almost exactly one year before the Eastland disaster, the Silver Spray ran aground on Morgan Shoal, just a few hundred feet off Hyde Park's 49th Street Beach. The 109-foot passenger steamer was on its way to pick up 200 University of Chicago students and take them to Gary, Indiana, to tour the steel mills. Today, the boiler is still visible from the beach. From the shore, it's easy to mistake the boiler for a rock or chuck of concrete. All that's left of the Silver Spray is its boiler and propeller.

What is Shakespeare doing in Lincoln Park?,Taylor B,"Ever since it was unveiled on April 23, 1894, more than a few art critics and casual observers have wondered why a large bronze sculpture of famous English playwright William Shakespeare is located in Chicago's Lincoln Park. Here's why: When wealthy North Side businessman Samuel Johnston died  in 1886, he left a sizable gift in his will for several charities as well as money specifically for a memorial to Shakespeare in Lincoln Park. Artist and one-time actor William Ordway Partridge, a Columbia University graduate who had studied sculpture in France and Italy, won a competition to create the memorial. Since the only known portraits of Shakespeare had been done after his death in 1616, Partridge made an extensive study of Shakespeare, including a death mask that was said to be authentic.

Superb Regional Theater,John B,"We attended the Friday evening performance of The Old Friends, an intense and well staged production of the lives of friends and family in a small Texas town with relationship dynamics and conflicts somewhat reminiscent of August, Osage County, though with two hours' running time and not three. Raven Theater has two performance spaces, and this excellent performance took place in the smaller one. The individual performances were strong and persuasive, and the ugly motives well revealed. One major scene change struck us as a brilliant piece of directing with the entire cast in motion, moving pieces and shouting over one another to create a completely different space from the previous scene. This fine production brought to mind early Northlight and Steppenwolf productions in terms of intensity and intimacy. We will be back.",Raven Theatre,February 2016,50

Experimental in its location and intent, this park proved to be nationally important. At the time, Chicago's existing parks were far away from the filthy, noisy, overcrowded tenement neighborhoods in the center of the city. So new park was envisioned that would provide social services as well as breathing spaces in these areas. The effort was so successful that the following year the South Park Commission began creating a whole system of new neighborhood parks for the south side. These innovative neighborhood parks influenced the development of other parks throughout the United States.",McKinley Park,May 2016,40

Where one of the world's most influential sculptors worked,Taylor B,"The Lorado Taft Midway Studios are a historic artist studio complex on the University of Chicago campus on Chicago's South Side. Located at 6016 South Ingleside Avenue and East 60th Street, south of the Midway Plaisance, the architecturally haphazard structure--you can bet that Frank Lloyd Wright wouldn't take credit for this building--originated as two converted two-story barns, one with a gabled roof and the other with a hip roof, and a two-story Victorian house. The interior was as rambling as the exterior, much of it composed of smaller studio spaces. It was used from 1906 to 1929 as the studio of Lorado Taft, one of the most influential sculptors of the period. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and declared a Chicago Landmark in 1993.

A wonder to behold,Taylor B,"Lucent is the mesmerizing and mind-boggling sculpture that hangs in the lobby of Chicago's John Hancock Building, which is located at 875 North Michigan Avenue. It is a wonder to behold. And it certainly lives up to its name. Lucent is derived from the Latin word ""lucere,"" meaning ""to shine."" Made of 3,115 lights, the number of visible stars in the Northern Hemisphere, the 13-foot artwork depicts a scale map of the stars that shine in the night sky. The sculpture, created by English artist Wolfgang Buttress with the assistance of astrophysicist Dr. Daniel Bayliss of the Australian National University, contains thousands of glass bulbs, all fed light through blue illuminating fiber-optic lines. It represents a 3D map of all the stars in the Northern Hemisphere that are visible with the naked eye. According to Buttress, who also created the award-winning UK Pavilion at Milan Expo 2015 in Italy, this cosmic-inspired sculpture aims to express ""the idea of looking up and sensing wonder."" All of the piece's glass bulbs were hand blown by artists at a Chicago glass studio. Each one of the 3,115 bulbs is amplified even more against a mirrored ceiling above and a reflecting pool below. The end result is a glorious piece of artwork that seems to go on forever with light looking from sky to ground over and over again. You've never seen anything like it.",Lucent,November 2019,50

The school's Opera and Theatre departments have shared the theatre with many prominent Chicago performing arts organizations, as well as companies from around the world, but the evening we were there, the venue belonged to the DePaul University Opera Theatre for a fresh, bubbling, and startlingly professional performance of Strauss' Die Fledermaus. Under the steady direction of conductor Steven Mosteller and director Harry Silverstein, the students of the DePaul Opera Theatre presented a truly splendid party.

From Jack Johnson to Mahalia Jackson to Aretha Franklin to Martin Luther King Jr.,Taylor B,"Pilgrim Baptist Church, which was built between 1890 and 1891, is notable for its glorious history, its architectural significance, its cultural contributions, for the people who spoke there, for the people who were eulogized there and for the people who sang there. Located at 3301 South Indiana Avenue, at 33rd and Indiana, on Chicago's South Side, in the heart of the Bronzeville neighborhood, it originally was constructed for a synagogue, Kehilath Anshe Ma'arav. A Baptist congregation moved into the building in 1922. Pilgrim Baptist Church is credited as the birthplace of gospel music in the 1930s. Thomas A. Dorsey, the Father of Gospel Music, was the music director at the church for decades. Mahalia Jackson, Aretha Franklin, the Staples Singers and the Edwin Hawkins Singers performed at the church. Bessie Coleman was a member of the congregation. The funeral for world heavyweight champion boxer Jack Johnson was held there in 1946. The champion of the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., delivered sermons at the church. In 2006, the building was gutted by a fire, leaving only the brick and stone of the outer walls still standing and determined to be structurally sound. Reconstruction plans are ongoing.

Honoring black doughboys of World War I,Taylor B,"The Victory Monument at 35th Street and King Drive on Chicago's South Side was built to honor the 8th Regiment of the Illinois National Guard, an African-American unit that served in France during World War I.

It is a white granite shaft topped with a bronze doughboy sculpture that was added in 1936. On the monument's shaft are three bonze relief panels depicting life-sized figures. On one, the names of 137 members of the 8th Regiment who lost their lives during World War I are inscribed. The 8th was the last regiment pursuing the retreating German forces in the Aisne-Marne region of France just before the November 11, 1918 Armistice.

"Great train station, but it takes a while to learn",Mark37Chicago,"This is one of those places with a lot of little things it could take a while to learn.  If you just follow the crowd when the train comes in, you will end up going through the revolving doors, down the escalator and ending up on the far southern side of the station on Madison.  If you are going even a little north of Madison, there are better exits.  To get out at Randolph, take the stair down right off the train platform.  They look like they are going into the sewers, but there aren’t - there is a perfectly nice east/west concourse down there that exits onto Randolf.  There is also a way to get out onto Washington.  Go through the revolving doors, and down the stairs, but go north instead of south.  Overall, feels very safe and at rush hour there are lots of pedestrians for several blocks in every direction.  If you are going to the offices in the Citibank tower, you go up the escalator to the third floor lobby and check in.",Ogilvie Transportation Cener,January 2019,40

Then when buying our tickets the lady helped us get the cheapest option based on just what we needed and told us which platform the train was on. Being used to NYC where the staff seems clueless and also never want to help it was really nice to see as a tourist. ,Ogilvie Transportation Cener,November 2019,40

The largest mass grave in the Western Hemisphere,Taylor B,"As a Civil War historian, I was aware of Camp Douglas on Chicago's South Side, one of the largest and most infamous prisoner of war camps, the North's version of the South's Libby Prison and Andersonville. But until I did some research on historic Oak Woods Cemetery, located at 1035 East 67th Street, I wasn't aware of the Confederate Mound, said to be the largest mass grave in the Western Hemisphere. Thousands of soldiers died from such diseases as scurvy, dysentery and smallpox and some were shot as punishment as Camp Douglas lived up to its ""80 Acres of Hell"" nickname. Originally buried in Chicago City Cemetery near Camp Douglas, the Confederate coffins were relocated to Oak Woods Cemetery in 1866. The site was unremarkable until 1983 when a 30-foot-tall granite monument was erected atop the gravesite. It is topped with the bronze statue of a Confederate soldier and the names of 4,200 identified Confederate soldiers are listed on the sides. The rest of the thousands buried in the grave are unknown. How many? Nobody knows for sure. But it is estimated that up to 6,000 are buried on the site. In addition to the soldier's statue, the site is decorated by a pyramid of cannonballs and a cannon and three images: ""The Call to Arms"" showing a group rallying for the cause, ""A Soldier's Death Dream"" depicting a fallen soldier and his horse on the battlefield and ""A Veteran's Return Home"" showing a soldier arriving at a ruined cabin.",Confederate Mound,June 2019,50

Mid-century industrial vintage easy to get to on train,dave s,"Took the red line train up from downtown to this neighborhood by the lake and had a great lunch and found some gems. Edgewater Antique Mall is the best, price and what-not, but Broadway Antique Market just down the street is great,too. Both are big and have LOTS to see and buy. I like Industrial and mid-century design ,but they both have clothes and jewelry too. I got a great piece of italian pottery. And there are some good eats around the corner at Ann Sather's swedish or M. Henry trendy or Uncommon ground high end natural. Totally worth the trip for anybody who likes vintage and antiue stuff.",Edgewater Antique Mall,April 2014,50
This is where Hollywood began,Taylor B,"Charlie Chaplin was here. So was Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks Sr. And Bronco Billy Anderson, Ben Turpin, Wallace Beery, Gloria Swanson, Harold lloyd, Tom Mix and Francis X. Bushman. This is where Hollywood began--the Essanay Studios at 1333-1345 West Argyle Street in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood. The studio was founded in 1907. Its first film, ""An Awful Skate"" or ""The Hobo on Rollers,"" starring Ben Turpin (then the studio janitor), was produced for only a couple hundred dollars and released in July 1907. It grossed several thousand dollars and the studio began to prosper. In 1914, Essanay succeeded in hiring Charlie Chaplin away from Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios, offering him a higher salary and his own production unit. He made 14 short comedies for Essanay in 1915, including the landmark ""The Tramp"" with the famous shot of the lonely tramp with his back to the camera, walking down the road dejectedly, then squaring his shoulders optimistically and heading for his next adventure. Chaplin disliked the unpredictable weather of Chicago and left after only one year for sunny California and more money and more creative control. The Essanay building was later taken over by independent producer Norman Wilding, who made industrial films. In the early 1970s, a portion of the studio was offered to Columbia College for a dollar but the offer lapsed without action. Then it was given to a non-profit television corporation which sold it. One tenant was the midwest office of Technicolor. Today the Essanay lot is the home of St. Augustine's College and its main meeting hall has been named the Charlie Chaplin Auditorium. The studio was designated a Chicago Landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks in 1996 and acknowledged as the most important structure connected to the city's role in the history of motion pictures.",Essanay Studios,December 2014,50

It is an Eastern or Byzantine rite Catholic Church - one of the 22 Eastern Catholic Churches.  The first liturgy in this new church building was performed on 1 November 1976.  There are a number of architectural influences in the church building which include the ancient Hebrew temple in Jerusalem and old-testament synagogues to forums and meeting places of the Greeks and Romans.

So much interest and beauty in a small package!,tamara612016,"This parcel of land was once part of the historic Rosehill Cemetary. Some heroes managed to snatch it from the claws of retail developers. They cleaned out the invasive species, garbage, etc. and created a beautiful, very walkable loop that is doable for most folks. What do you see? Beautiful prairie grasses and wildflowers already four feet high. There are tall mature trees standing from the original plot. There is a forested area that is shady and where you may likely see a doe and her fawn in the early morning, grooming each other (they are so used to people that they will allow you to stand and gawk and picture take at a respectable distance!).  A great blue heron struts his stuff nonchalantly in the grasses or along side the beautiful lake. You may see him snag a sunfish out of the stocked pond that fishermen are also welcome to. The Center has a quaint play natural area for kids. There are benches and little areas where you can sit and look out on the water. Because the preserve abuts Rosehill cemetery, more wild plants and grasses as well as picturesque Rosehill graces the other side of the preserve to enjoy. If you are a birder, the birds do come!

The upstairs theater was intimate, modern and clean.  The bathrooms were also cleaner than local businesses and museums nearby. The upstairs windows give a lovely night view of the park.  The architecture feels unique and protective of the inner layers of the building.  This event did not offer concessions, but the lobby does have a permanent service area.

It is an amazing glass building with very unusual geometric designs.  I guess they ran out of money when it came to curating the museum.  In their prior building, they displayed much more in a smaller space.  Their first effort at curating exhibits was to follow the ""trend""of garage or warehousing their exhibits in long glass exhibit booths with exhibits hanging helter-skelter style , without much explanation of what they were or their provenance.  It's time they spent more time trying to be a real museum for the peopleand not trying to be so avant-garde that the museum goers do not understand what they are seeing.",Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership,July 2014,30

Wonderful evening at the Mayne Stage,Jeffrey49,"It took about 45 minutes by the red line from downtown to the Mayne Stage Theater in Chicago---but it was worth it!  We attended a concert that was part of the World Music Festival in the city.  The Mayne Stage was a great place to listen to some music and have a drink/snack.  The accoustics were good; the visual appeal of the interior was excellent; and the staff were professional and helpful.  If you have the opportunity of visiting this theatre, go for it.

An odd mix of skills and people,DxK67,"I saw this place when walking down the street with my brother when visiting Chicago.  We didn't have any plans for the weekend that we couldn't change so we decided to catch the Star Wars A New Hope parody that this theater puts on .  Some of the women are attractive and some are meh, I think I would gotten more from a show that took the burlesque more seriously.  The dialogue wasn't particularly amusing to myself.  My brother did like the humor, but to me there was too much swearing and less concern about telling the story.  It was a good show to see one of, but I'm not sure if I'd go to a second show here.  The seating was pretty good, the beer choice was okay, and I didn't appreciate the troupe hitting the customers for more money in the middle of te show.",Gorilla Tango Theatre,May 2013,30
AWESOME,DisearningPallet,"Indiana Jones kept us rolling in the isle. Hilarious take on a classic. This was our first night in Chicago and we were floored. The hospitality of the staff was unreal.

A historic gem steps from the Red Line,ArlieinChicago,"The Mayne Stage, along with Act One Pub, is a lovely piece of Chicago history restored to its original glory and remade into a venue for amazing music, dancing and stage entertainment in an intimate, gorgeous room.  Every time I see a musical performance there, the musicians say ""This is the best performance space in Chicago,"" and I think they mean it.  There is not a bad seat in the place, and you can sit cabaret style around tables on the main floor by the dance area, around the sides at two-person tables in front of comfortable bench seats, in back at larger tables with a straight-on view of the stage, or upstairs on the mezzanine.  Every seat in the house feels close and personal.  When I was there with a date recently, three excellent bands played blues, jazz, swing, and rockabilly music from the 20's through the 50's. The dance floor was full of swing steppers for every song--all three hours of the show.  Our tickets were $15 apiece, and we enjoyed drinks and appetizers during the show with assistance from very attentive waiters.  This venue is three blocks from my condo, but I understand that for others, it might be a hike up to Rogers Park.  Don't sweat it.  Use the Red Line (a half block away) or the valet parking service and stop off along the way at one of the recently emerging nice restaurants along Morse, or eat and drink right there at Act One, in the same building.  (The huge art deco window in front is an excellent place to watch snow falling.)  You can't beat the value of this place and you'll have a vintage experience akin to the Green Mill or the Aragon Ballroom.",Mayne Stage,December 2012,50
One hundred years of teaching at St. Constance School,Allen21096,"On 6 May 2017, the parish of St. Constance celebrated 100 years of scholastic achievement.  After the parish was formed in 1916, the next thing that the parish needed was a school.  In 1917, the school was established and the School Sisters of Notre Dame began teaching the first 72 parish children.  Over the years it has provided for pre-school and kindergarten, a girl's high school (the former Cardinal Stritch High School, on the 2nd flr. of the old church building), a Saturday Polish language school and a full elementary school with grades 1 - 8.  In 1959, the current elementary school was built and opened on the site of the old parish grotto.  It was a huge improvement over the old school which was on the 3rd floor of the church building.  The current principal, Eva M. Panczyk, has been at St. Constance School for many years, first as a teacher and later as its principal.  St. Constance School is accredited by both the State of Illinois and the Archdiocese of Chicago and has been recognized for Academic Excellence for six consecutive years.  The classrooms are outfitted with the latest technology to assist in the teaching.  There are enrichment programs that consist of Homework Help Class, Lego Engineering Club, Martial Arts, Crochet Club, Bell Choir, Home Economics, Piano/Keyboard or Guitar Class and the Young Rembrandts.  St. Constance parish & school was named after St. Constance who lived from 325 A.D. to 354 A.D.  She was born the daughter of the Emperor, Constantine the Great and converted to Christianity after being cured of leprosy.",St. Constance Church,May 2017,50

The man who debated Lincoln,Taylor B,"Most people aren't even aware that it's there. What's there? Even if they know, they probably don't don't who he was. Even today, people are awed by the 10-foot statue of the man who stands atop a 96-foot column of white marble at the end of a street on Chicago's South Side. The scenic park, which overlooks Lake Michigan, is the burial place of U.S. Senator Steven A. Douglas, one of the most distinguished statesman of his day. Located at 636 East 35th Street in the Bronzeville neighborhood, the Stephen A. Douglas Tomb and Memorial or Stephen A. Douglas Monument Park is near the site of Camp Douglas, a Union Army prisoner of war camp during the Civil War. Douglas, best remembered for his series of debates with Abraham Lincoln over the issue of slavery, died from typhoid fever on June 3, 1861 in Chicago. His 10-foot bronze statue stands atop a 96-foot-tall granite structure that was begun in 1866 and completed in 1881. Three circular bases are topped by a 20-foot diameter octagonal mausoleum. Inside, a Vermont marble sarcophagus contains Douglas' remains, surmounted by a marble bust of the man known as the ""Little Giant.""

When my husband and I arrived I was a little dismayed by the tiny size and grunge of the theatre but decided to hang in as I am a Star Trek fan and was intrigued by the premise of an all-female cast of the Star Trek characters. The bar tender was friendly an provided drinks while we waited for our show. The burlesque troop of women was surprisingly engaging and innovative. They were a range of different physical and comedic types but they were all interesting and I found myself rooting for them to succeed. Altogether, an enjoyable show.

A very small selection of beer is available for purchase.  The performance and costuming were not what I would consider the quality of a professional burlesque troupe.  The costuming was obviously handmade and/or purchased from a store like Target.  The performers were beautiful, funny, and brave.  Many props to them!  However, I felt scammed by the price and advertising.  Not worth the price.  Also, the performers incorporated a tip request into the show which felt insulting.  Very unprofessional overall, but still a fun time.",Gorilla Tango Theatre,May 2015,30

It once was home to 116 automobile dealerships, from Ford and Cadillac to Hudson and Pierce-Arrow. Designated as a historic district in 2000 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, it now features 50 stunning buildings designed and built by the likes of Albert Kahn, Philip Maher, Holabird & Roche and other notable architects from 1905 to 1936. The district includes building stretching from 2200 to 2500 on South Michigan Avenue directly west of the McCormick Place convention center and at 1444, 1454, 1737, 1925 and 2000 on South Michigan as well as 2246 to 3453 on South Indiana and 2211 to 2247 on South Wabash. Currently, only one dealership (Ford) remains in the district while other buildings have been or are being developed into condominiums, nightclubs and retail stores. The range of buildings in Motor Row illustrates the evolution of the automobile showroom and related product and service buildings from simple two-story structures used for display and offices to multi-story buildings used for housing a variety of departments, including repair, storage, painting and finishing. Motor Row also is home to the Chicago Defender, the distinguished black-oriented newspaper. Chess Records, which once recorded the sounds of blues singer Muddy Waters, also was located in Motor Row. The Rolling Stones, Willie Dixon and many other blues artists also recorded there. Currently, Fearless Radio is located in Motor Row on the 24th block of South Michigan.

Enjoying my walk,Jerald Q,No walk without passing by here .and feeling the history of lincoln park. And remembering the story of the couch family that mrs. Couch was a large hotel owner when she was liveing.,Couch Mausoleum,August 2013,50
Part of Lincoln Park's history,dvkremk,The Couch Mausoleum is the one grave that was not moved from the area when they moved the rest of the graves in the Chicago City Cemetery to make way for the park.  It is interesting to walk by while strolling through Lincoln Park to be reminded of the history of this location.,Couch Mausoleum,June 2015,30
Okay?,DarkRoads,"This random mausoleum feels out of place in Lincoln Park.  I realize that it was there first, but I was still surprised to find it.  It’s nothing special, just a stone building.  Other than spending a few moments to reading the plaque, there’s really nothing else to do.",Couch Mausoleum,April 2016,30

TimeLine Offers Excellent Theater of Historic Events,Dennis F,"This is our second visit to TimeLine Theatre this season and we live 250 miles away! The productions are that good. (Thanks to Amtrak, for making it so easy to get into the heart of Chicago from the heart of Michigan). TimeLine Theatre Company offers entertaining, gutsy, intimate performances of topics taken from the fabric of historical events, and interwoven into the lives of characters you come to care about, thanks to professional live performance.  This is a small theater, in the round, and because of that, it puts you in the middle of these historic events or the interpretation of these events as they unfold.  If schools taught history like this, it would be everyones favorite subject.  What a wonderful theatre company and we hope to keep coming back for more shows in the future.",TimeLine Theatre,March 2012,50
Briliant plays at this neighborhood theater,kevintyn,"I've seen two plays here. The last was Enron, a fascinating interpretation of the financial scandal.

Who is buried in Couch's Tomb?,Taylor B,"My wife and I live only a block from the Chicago History Museum so we have walked past the Couch Mausoleum countless times over the past 36 years and, like many other curious observers, have wondered about its mysteries. Located on the north lawn of the Chicago History Museum and south of North LaSalle Drive, at the axis with North Stockton Drive, it is the last above-ground reminder of Lincoln Park's earlier history as a public cemetery. Even today, it is shrouded in mystery. What is certain is the tomb was commissioned in the mid-1800s by Ira Couch, a wealthy businessman, who died in 1857. However, when the cemetery became part of Lincoln Park in 1869 and other families moved remains of their relatives to other cemeteries in the city, the Couch Mausoleum remained in place. Apparently, the enormous 50-ton marble structure that survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was too expansive and too big to move.  But who is buried in Couch's Tomb? Some argue Ira Couch is the only occupant. Others claim from six to 13 family members are buried within. One historian insists Ira Couch is buried in his family's plot in Chicago's Rosehill Cemetery. No one knows for sure. Meanwhile, Couch's Mausoleum isn't going anywhere, In 1999, a gift of $100,000 was donated to tuck-point the tomb's masonry, recreate its original ornamental fencing and install lighting for nighttime illumination.",Couch Mausoleum,May 2019,50
A whole lot of fun on a great night,Allen21096,"We were able to get tickets for the rooftop at the Lakeview Baseball Club for the sixth game of the National League Championship Series with the Chicago Cubs hosting the L.A. Dodgers.  We knew going in that the view would be obstructed, but with the energy of all the fans, we didn't think it made a huge difference.  If you get there early enough, you can find a spot where you can see a bit more.  The food was good and towards the end, there were freshly made cookies and brownies.  As the Cubs won the game 5-0 and the series (4-2) over the Dodgers, it turned out to be a great evening.  On to the Cleveland Indians and the World Series!",Lakeview Baseball Club,October 2016,50
Jimmy Buffet Concert,jmdkfish,"This is a horrible place. No view, No TV monitors and the sound was so horrible that you could not make out who was even on stage.

You will regret your purchase.",Lakeview Baseball Club,July 2017,10
No View at ALL!!!,MD604,"We were told our view would be obstructed but for the Jimmy Buffett concert we couldn't see a darn thing! and the sound was horrible too!! I realize the sound isn't their fault but it was an issue. Second, the food was blah. The Hamburger I got and the nachos were both luke warm at best. And don't even get me started on the line!!!! It took me 25 minutes to get through the line to even get food because they have a tiny cafeteria style set up with just a few people working it. And they only let you get one drink at a time. That's absurd. It should at least be 2 because not only do you have to miss part of the concert to go down to get a beer, but you either do it twice, or my wife misses a part of it too. NOTE: right below where we were was another ""VIP"" level that went totally unused. Ive been on other rooftops and the food at them was much better. This was a very limited menu. Ive been on some where they have pizza, burgers, Italian beef, hot dogs, and even dessert. Not this one. I will say though that the staff was all very friendly, so they get an extra point in my rating because of them.  It was still fun to experience the whole area of Wrigey but they advertise all you can eat and drink but when you go through the line you could only pick 2 things at a time. And at a super long wait, who had the time to go back more than once. And the ticket also didn't say there was a 3 hour window for drinks/food. They closed the food off before that 3 hour window ever came. So after 930 there was no alcohol or food being served and there was still 90 minutes left to his show. Most people were so fed up they were leaving at that point! Us included!",Lakeview Baseball Club,July 2017,20

My boyfriend made the mistake of buying the Groupon for 2 day passes and thought they could be used for 2 different people on one day. We called and they were totally understanding and allowed us each to use one of the passes. The man who checked us in showed us around the whole gym and and where the walls we could climb on where. There is so much more to do here than just climb and I love it! If I lived closer I would consider buying a membership. Everyone seemed very chill and welcoming yet ready to better themselves. This is such a great place in the middle of the city. The only downside is for people like me who want to climb but did not have the belay certification, which means there was only 6 routes to climb and 2 were shut down for repairs. That being said the ones that were open were great, but more auto belays would be appreciated.",Brooklyn Boulders,March 2019,40

"America's oldest and largest ""Automobile Row""",Taylor B,"How many people realize that Henry Ford actually launched the sales of his new-fangled automobiles in Chicago? In 1905, Ford arrived at Chicago's Central Station by train, just steps from the South Michigan Avenue site that would be his first store outside Detroit. His new plan to sell automobiles from bright showrooms would change Chicago and America--and transform a quiet city neighborhood into the largest and most glamorous concentration of auto dealerships in the country. The historic Motor Row District on Chicago's Near South Side was built between 1905 and 1936 and includes buildings on South Michigan Avenue between 22nd and 25th Street, directly west of McCormick Place convention center, and 1444, 1454, 1737, 1925 and 2000 South Michigan Avenue as well as 2246 to 3453 South Indiana Avenue and 2211 to 2247 South Wabash Avenue. At its peak, as many as 116 different makes of automobiles were being sold on Motor Row. Some are familiar today, including Ford, Buick, Fiat and Cadillac while others are better known to historians and old car buffs, including Hudson, Studebaker, Marmon, Stutz, Packard, Peerless, Pierce-Arrow and Locomobile. Currently, only one car dealership (Fiat/Alfa Romeo) still stands on Motor Row while the remaining buildings have been or are being redeveloped into condominiums, nightclubs, restaurants, bars and retail storefronts. The district was declared a Chicago Landmark in 2000 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Motor Row also was home to the Chicago Defender, the newspaper voice of Chicago's large African American community, and Chess Records, where such musical legends as Muddy Waters, the Rolling Stones and Willie Dixon once recorded their songs. Motor Row began to decline during the Great Depression as auto dealers began to move to other city and suburban locations. Finally, World War II stopped civilian car production, ending Motor Row's long prominence. But Henry Ford's old showroom, an investment he made with only $243 in his bank account, still stands at 1444 South Michigan Avenue.",Motor Row District,August 2017,50
Blues on Motor/Record Row,sleepster,"Some of the best blues and blues based rock and roll was recorded at the old Chess Records Studio near 22nd and Michigan. Wander south on a Thursday night and catch the son of the famous Willie Dixon, Freddie Dixon, perform real Chicago Blues with the Original Chicago Blues All Stars at Motor Row Brewing.

My wife and I went on a weekday morning, and it was crowded, but we were able to see all the artwork, read all the placards, and stand still and move around as much as we needed to. There are a few benches available for sitting, though we didn't use them. We'd bought tickets using the Art Institute of Chicago website artic.edu during our L ride to downtown, and with them we got into the exhibit with no wait at about 11 am.

can't take good picture inside due to very dark,ELKW,"it's one of the attractions in the Chicago open house event, I search the pictures online and found that it's beautiful both inside and outside, that's why we want to go there to take a look, however, it's raining on that day, and may have some construction work in the exterior part, so there are some cage outside, making it not so beautiful to be filmed. when you go inside, it should be a gorgeous church, but inside is very dark, not sure if it would be better in a sunny day, but I think they should switch on the lights for the visitors, since it participated in the open house event, and it only opens for a few hours on the Sat morning, so just a few hours, why not turn on the lights? also there is no person standing by, nor welcoming people, I see other churches and attractions, most of them have people standing at the door, to welcome people, answer any questions or even have a guided tour, I don't expect too much, but at least you facilitate the people who come to visit your church during the open house event by switching on the lights, so that we can take a good picture, but they didn't do anything. If you don't want to accommodate any visitors, you should not participate in this event. But as they participate in this open house event, I think they should take their responsibility to facilitate the visitors, to show their best side to us.I really disappointed as I can't see the true beauty of the church.",St. Mary of the Angels,October 2017,30

One of America's most active arts centers,Taylor B,"Chopin Theatre is to Chicago what the Actors Studio is to New York City. Although Chopin doesn't receive as much hoopla as Steppenwolf, it has made its own mark in the acting profession. Founded in 1990, Chopin Theatre has grown into one of America's most active arts centers, producing, co-producing or presenting over 500 theater, music, film, literary and social events each year. With approximately 1,800 unique events over its 27-year history, its mission is the promotion of enlightened civic discourse through a diverse range of artistic offerings. Chopin, which is privately held and operates without public funding, has produced over 110 of its own productions, mostly Eastern European, and has hosted performers from each American state and from over 40 countries. Located at 1543 West Division Street across the Polish Triangle in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood, Chopin has featured Pulitzer Prize winners Gwendolyn Brooks, Yusef Komunyaka and Studs Terkel, authors Sara Paretsky, Art Shay and Howard inn, poets Nikki Giovanni and Mark Smith, actors John Cusack and Jeremy Piven and musicians Kurt Elling, Edward Auer, Peter Brotzman and Von Freeman. Originally constructed in 1918 as a 987-seat nickelodeon, today the building houses a 226-seat Main Stage, a 175-seat Cabaret Studio with its Pregnant Buffalo Lounge, the Nelson Algren Cafe and the East Wing Art Gallery. Guided by owners Zygmunt and Lela Dyrkacz, Chopin also produces I-Fest, an international festival of solo performances which has brought to Chicago 17 international artists from 10 countries. Recent productions of the Nutcracker and Dean and Harry Houdini have been very popular. Chopin is a smaller theatre compared with the downtown venues but it is very intimate and comfortable.

With the small size of the theater there isn't a bad seat in the house.  Paradise Blue was written by Dominique Morisseau with original music by Orbert Davis.  The time is the 1950's, the place is Detroit, the setting is a jazz club, and the characters are the men and women of Paradise Valley/Black Bottom.

Wonderfully welcoming and astounding,hurdlehouse,"Located in the Ukrainian Village section of Chicago, the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art is well worth a visit for its art and for giving insight into history. Founded in 1971 and housed in a repurposed building with a striking facade by Chicago Architect Stanley Tigerman, it features paintings, sculptures, and other works of art by contemporary Eastern European artists. Our group of 25 saw the current exhibit, ""30 Years after Chernobyl"".  One spacious gallery was devoted entirely to artists with some connection to the disaster. The works can only be described as revealing and challenging. Our guide was the curator, a young man whose mother had been exposed while pregnant with him; she was among the first to take potassium iodide to prevent damage to her unborn child. The other gallery was devoted to works by Chicago area artists and their reactions to Chernobyl . Our guide was a young artist whose commentary illuminated the striking variety of works, including some installations of particular impact.  We also had a behind the scenes tour where we saw items from the permanent collection which have been displaced to accommodate the current exhibit. They would be stunning on display. UIMA hosts concerts, discussions, and films, most recently ""The Babushkas of Chernobyl"".  We felt as if we had uncovered a real find. Just two doors down, we descended upon a Ukrainian grocery/deli which offered all sorts of items from Eastern Europe as well as home made Ukrainian delicacies. Alas, we wished we had had more cash as no plastic is accepted.

"Chicago's oldest house, a time capsule",Taylor B,"Most people think Chicago's oldest house is the Clarke House, built in 1836, on the near South Side. Not true. The oldest house is the Noble-Seymour-Crippen House, built in 1833, at 5622-24 North Newark Avenue in Norwood Park. The property was built on a glacial moraine ridge within feet of what would have been the Lake Michigan shoreline during the Ice Age. A former farmhouse, it is now a museum and community center, home to the Norwood Park Historical Society. It was designated as a Chicago landmark in 1988 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The southern wing of the house was originally used as a farmhouse by Mark Noble Sr, an English immigrant. The frame structure was approximately 25 feet by 30 feet. In 1868, Thomas Hartley Seymour of the Chicago  Board of Trade purchased the house and surrounding land. He immediately added an Italianate style northern wing to accommodate his large family and servants. He also raised the roof on the south wing to build a second floor. The Seymour family lived at the site until 1916 when they sold it to Stuart and Charlotte Allen Crippen, a concert pianist and an actress. During the 1920s, the Crippens installed indoor plumbing and electricity and added a second stairway to the Noble wing. The Crippen children and grandchildren sold the building and the remaining 1.7 acres of land to the Norwood Park Historical Society in 1987. The house is considered a time capsule. It was built four decades before Norwood Park was incorporated as an official village in 1874. The neighborhood became part of Chicago in 1893. The Norwood Park Historical Society saved the house from demolition when it purchased the property and turned the house into a museum containing many artifacts found on the property and just beneath the surface. Archeologists have found everything from a button dating to the late 1700s to a Jane Byrne mayoral campaign button from the late 1970s. Also 418 coins, a cow's tooth, a curry comb used to groom horses, toys like lead soldiers and a Junior Police badge, a miniature cookie cutter, a compass, 100-plus-year-old square nails, screwdrivers, electric fuses, lamp parts, pottery, toy guns, a 1917 Smith & Wesson revolver, a 1965 rabies tag from Niles Animal Hospital and chert flakes used by Native Americans to make stone tools. It is amazing to realize that a building dating to 1833, nearly four decades before the Chicago Fire, has been restored to its original form and has been made available for the public to enjoy.",Noble-Seymour-Crippen House,January 2016,50

The oldest house in Chicago,Taylor B,"Clark House on Chicago's near South Side, part of the Prairie Avenue Historic District, has long been celebrated as the oldest house in Chicago, dating to 1836. But the fact is the Noble-Seymour-Crippen House is older. Located at 5622 North Newark Avenue in the Norwood Park neighborhood, it was built in 1833. It has been a Chicago Landmark since 1988. A former farmhouse, it is now a museum and community center. The southern wing of the house was originally used as a farmhouse by Mark Noble Sr., an English immigrant. The frame structure was about 25 by 30 feet and the main entrance was in the center of the south-facing end, facing Talcott Road. It was built with white pine on a brick foundation. The center of the building featured a fireplace and there was probably a basement. In 1868, Thomas Hartley Seymour of the Chicago Board of Trade purchased the house and surrounding land. He added an Italianate style northern wing to accommodate his large family and servants. He also raised the roof on the older south wing and built a second floor. The family used the first floor of the former Noble house as a large dining room and used the second floor as servants' quarters. The Seymour family lived at the site until 1916, when they sold it to Stuart and Charlotte Allen Crippen, a concert pianist and an actress. During the 1920s, the Crippens installed indoor plumbing and electricity and added a second stairway to the Noble wing. The Crippen children and grandchildren sold the building to the Norwood Park Historical Society in 1987. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.",Noble-Seymour-Crippen House,November 2018,50
Sculpture by Henry Moore,O6378WFannag,"This monument by sculptor Henry Moore was located here 25 years after the first nuclear bomb was dropped on Japan. It is located here because that is were E. Fermi conducted the world's first nuclear reactor, Chicago Pile-1.   One of the most discussed and admired sculptures on campus of the University of Chicago. ",Nuclear Energy Sculpture,February 2019,50
Where Jay Berwanger won the Heisman Trophy,Taylor B,"Nuclear Energy, a 12-foot-high bronze sculpture by renowned British sculptor Henry Moore, stands on the site where a team of physicists and scientists, led by Enrico Fermi, initiated humankind's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as the ""Chicago Pile"" at 3:25 p.m. on December 2, 1942. It was in the basement of the stadium on the University of Chicago campus, where Amos Alonzo Stagg coached football teams and Jay Berwanger won the first Heisman Trophy in 1935 as college football's best player. Moore's form, located on Ellis Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets, was dedicated in 1967 on the 25th anniversary of the event. It invites comparison to a mushroom cloud, a human skull or protective helmet and allows viewers to contemplate the complex implications of the discovery. While many people saw great potential in atomic energy, the project triggered the creation of the atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan in 1945 and ended World War II. ",Nuclear Energy Sculpture,April 2019,50
Marking the beginning of the nuclear age,Taylor B,"At first glance, it looks like a basketball on a pedestal. Or a tooth. Or a skull. Or a cathedral. But the man who created it said the working model looked like the top of a large mushroom or a mushroom cloud. So there it is, a bronze sculpture by Henry Moore on the campus of the University of Chicago, on South Ellis Avenue, north of 56th Street, between the Max Palevsky West Dormitory and the Mansueto Library, in the Hyde Park neighborhood, at the site of the world's first nuclear reactor, Chicago Pile-1. Created in 1964-1966, the sculpture is called Nuclear Energy and it commemorates the exact location where the Manhattan Project team devised the first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction on December 2, 1942. It was in the basement of the now demolished west stands of the old Stagg Field. It is described as 14 feet in height and eight feet in diameter and it sits atop a base that is 1 1/2 feet in height and 10 feet in diameter. It was erected for and dedicated at the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the first self-sustaining controlled nuclear reaction on the grounds by Enrico Fermi in 1942. Thus, it was unveiled at precisely 3:36 p.m. on December 2, 1967. It was designed a National Historic Landmark in 1965 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 as one of the original designated historic places. It was named a Chicago Landmark in 1971.",Nuclear Energy Sculpture,December 2019,50

We actually walked to it while we were waiting for the Shoreline tourboat to come in and load up for a new trip, so it is not far.  The statue was a gift in May of 2000, from the Chicago Lodge of Shipmasters International which represents ship's captains.  It is dedicated to those seafarers that sailed the Great Lakes.

Another OMG Experience!!!,Steven D,"Another outstanding Cirque performance!  This show is more urban and has a different feel than some of the other Cirque shows.  The music is electrifying, with EDM (Electric Dance Music) along with live musicians makes for an amazing performance.  All the performers are young, beautiful, have amazing bodies and some of the most talented there is.  A third of the Cirque performers are said to be former Olympians and it shows.     It is hard to select the best performance because just as you think you saw the best, the next one is just as good or better.  The talent is truly amazing - leaves you gasping!  I had the privilege of going Behind the Scenes and it was worth the extra money.  I can't say enough about the show - it is a MUST see!!!  Go and be impressed and entertained like no other show can do!!!",Cirque du Soleil Volta,May 2019,50
Fantastic!,gport,Fantastic show!  We have attended each of the Cirque shows in Chicago since the mid 90's.  This new site at Soldier Field South lot is easy to access with plenty of adjacent parking ($25).  It is a new grand tent with new comfortable seats.   The show was spectacular -- more athletic with new spins on acts.  The BMX act was pretty awesome but probably was more awesome from seats other than front center section - we had the ramp blocking most of our view - rather disappointing for the money we paid (at least we didn't pay for the VIP seats).  Cirque knows how to give you a great show and this doesn't fail!  ,Cirque du Soleil Volta,June 2019,50
Disappointing,sisterida,I have seen other Cirque performances and this one did not measure up to the other standards. I found the routines basically the same as in other shows with different music.

If you are arriving via your own vehicle, be sure to purchase your garage ticket ahead of time because nearby garage parking was unreasonably expensive ($40+ for 2 hours).   Children under 12 are free, but I do not think most kids would enjoy the museum; teenagers with an interest in writing or literature would and their admission fee is discounted.  It is quiet and you will spend most of your time reading.  My favorite parts included the Word Waterfall, which I found to be mesmerizing, and the opportunity to type on the ""old"" typewriters and start your own story or finish someone else's story.

I went on on Veterans' Day, so the entire place was empty. The church has plenty of street parking around it, so getting to it by car is not a problem.",St. Hyacinth Basilica,November 2015,50
Church has become a Basilica,generations2b,"Haven't visited this parish since childhood;  it is beautiful! Now that it is a basilica, it means a lot more.",St. Hyacinth Basilica,July 2016,50
As beautiful as the churches in Europe!,cabtucker,My mother was one of the first baptised in St. Hyacinth's in 1921. It was my church for many years but just went back to visit for the first time in 18 years and I never realized how absolutely beautiful it is. I have visited churches all over the world and this is definitely worth the trip.,St. Hyacinth Basilica,August 2016,50
Beautiful,728cherylb,The front doors are beautiful along with the rest of the basilica. Located in a Polish influenced neighborhood.. They offer papers in both English and Polish. The only downside to me was there was no literature to explain the history or paintings in the church. Have visited other basilicas and they have had literature on this or apps that tell about the church or a guide. This would have been nice. ,St. Hyacinth Basilica,August 2016,40
Superb Polish Baroque Styled Church,Rolf A,"A little out of the way but a perfect place to learn about Polish history in Chicago. Founded in 1894 by the Resurrectionists, St. Hyacynth was designed by Worthmann and Steinbach, prominent Chicago church architects, in the heart of the ""Polish Patch"" and remains a keystone for Chicago's Polish Catholics. ",St. Hyacinth Basilica,May 2017,50
Interesting but very small,ilaudio,Interesting how many things he inspired...but very small and wood stain slopped on in places. I was surprised how quickly we went through.,The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition,December 2016,30
"Disappointing. Small, not enough information",CynthiainChicago,"The recreated machines are small, the exhibit does not contain all of the 'machines' that the video t the exhibit is talking about.  The verbiage attached to each was rather limited and there was no overall information on DaVinci's history, his 'codex' of drawings, etc.  Only took us an hour (longer than most view it) and my husband reads every little word.",The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition,December 2016,30
Educational experience,dvkremk,"We took our two grandsons (7 and 10) and daughter to the exhibit.  There were some hands on exhibits to teach the kids about the machines.  As adults, we learned a lot also.   We also enjoyed the movie about DaVinci.",The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition,December 2016,40
It’s not there,roadster690,"I searched for it using the website and the guides, the only place that looked like it was a winemaking place. Pretty poor not to mention you won’t be there. Gonna give this place a huge thumbs down just for that",The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition,December 2017,30
Nice statue,jsmithRN4L,"Nice statue located in Grant Park of Gen. John Logan Memorial who was a soldier and political leader... he also has a statue in Washington, D.C.",Gen. John Logan Memorial,June 2013,30
Question of Scale,D M W,"The statue is on a raised hill with a flight of manageable stone stairs leading to it, with all round views, from the top?Seen from distance it gives scale to the nearby property developments etc, built since the statue, park itself was built?",Gen.

Intimate Venue for Fantastic Productions,casa1234,"I've been to several productions at Red Orchid Theater in Old Town and always leave feeling moved (happy, sad, disturbed). The space is very small which helps draw you in and makes you feel as though you are a part of the production.   I recently saw Traitor and it was fantastic - a must see. It took the audience through a range of emotions with plenty to laugh at while tackling a serious subject with a somewhat disturbing end.  It was very thought provoking and still leaves me with a haunting feeling.  The cast was masterful!  An excellent venue with top notch productions!",Red Orchid Theater,January 2018,50
Must see!,J5168LOmaryw,"Intimate theater (maybe 75) with amazing actors and productions. Just saw Traitor, directed by Michael Shannon.  Active audience participation with this show.  We walked 2 doors down to a ""town meeting"".  Theater in the heart of Old Town. Great restaurants steps away.  Subscriber for years and years to come!",Red Orchid Theater,February 2018,50
"Intimate, Inventive Theater in the Heart of Old Town",Shelby F,"I saw shocking, personal, and familiar pieces of myself in each of the characters, but my favorite character was the older woman who depicted a down-on-her-luck hippie/bodyworker/estranged sister. I totally forgot she was playing a character until curtain call came and I was shaken out of my ""theater trance."" Overall, a phenomenal job by AROT. Can't wait to see what they create next.",Red Orchid Theater,March 2019,50
Horrible Seating for Non-Subscribers,YB84,"This policy is not stated anywhere on the website (nor do they have a seating plan available) - when I talked to the theatre manager (Abigail) about this, she chose to ignore the question about why they don't disclose this policy *before* you purchase the tickets.",Red Orchid Theater,October 2019,10
Family Visit to See the Exhibit,Carla V,"An excellent display of Da Vinci Machines, some you are able to touch, others just look at. Highly recommend to take the tour as their knowledge and understanding of Da Vinci makes the exhibition more exciting!

Hope it returns to the area,LadyM005,"minute movie that is very informative.  However, it is in the center of the exhibit and can get noisy if people are standing outside of the screening area talking.  My husband and I watched the entire movie and would have liked more.  You can do a self guided tour (which we did), take a free audio tour, or have a guide at a specific time at no charge.  Kids will love the hands on experience. There is a designated area for children with crayons and craft items.  I didn't check it out but it looked fairly large and attractive.",The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition,August 2016,50
walking back from United Centre,nickd18,I had been looking at the public art installations the previous day and wasn't expecting to see another big piece as it wasn't on the walking self guided tour that I'd done.

An imposing statue in a small plaza,1945DJM,"The plaza does not have a great view downtown but the statue in the plaza of the former president of Mexico,  is very large and quite imposing. It is good to see that the information on the plaque at the foot of the statue is in both English and Spanish.",Benito Juarez Plaza,October 2018,40
Visit both plazas--on the Magnificent Mile and in Pilsen,Taylor B,"Since the 1970s, the Latino community has grown by leaps and bounds in Chicago. So it makes sense to learn about the history of the Mexican people. Two places are the Benito Juarez Plaza adjacent to Benito Juarez Community Academy at 1450-1510 West Cermak Road in the Pilsen neighborhood and the Plaza of the Americas, on the Magnificent Mile, north of the Chicago River, between the Wrigley Building and the Realtor Building, in downtown Chicago. The plaza next to Benito Juarez Community Academy, one of the largest high schools in Illinois, features statues of Juarez and other Mexican patriots. Downtown, the plaza features a full-length, 16-foot-tall bronze statue of Juarez, which was created by artist Julian Martinez. Juarez was known as the builder of modern Mexico. He served five terms as president of Mexico, from 1858 to 1872.",Benito Juarez Plaza,May 2019,50
Free entertainment from an interesting parade,Allen21096,"The Pride Parade in Chicago can best be described as free entertainment.  There certainly is a large amount of community support and the parade is well attended.  It usually starts at Montrose Ave. & Broadway Ave. and heads south to Diversey Parkway & Sheridan Rd., where it empties in to Lincoln Park.  We don't go to the after party in the park, but we get a kick out of the parade itself.  The only caveat that I have is don't take the kids.  It is much too risque, in my honest opinion, for kids to be there.",Chicago Pride Parade,June 2017,40

Awesome workout every time!,sophiakberg,"I have been part of the iLoveKickboxing fit fam for over a year and a half now and I absolutely love it. The instructors are really engaging and always check in with you, the music is great and everyone is super friendly. The workout is reliably one of the best that I've ever had. I got pregnant my first month of membership, which obviously gave me some concerns over the 12 month membership I signed up for. I continued attending classes through my 7th month of pregnancy, working with Peggie and the other instructors for customized workouts each session. Peggie and Jerry were great about pausing my membership until I felt I was ready to come back (when my son was 4 months old), and again helped me go at my own pace when I returned and helping with workouts for my situation. With work and the baby, I don't get in as often as I want, but every time I do I feel extremely welcomed and valued.

Statue,JaroslavNecas,"Statue in the Grand park, itself it's not extraordinary. I briefly saw it during my walk through the park.",Gen. John Logan Memorial,March 2018,30
He survived the Civil War and the 1968 anti-war protests,Taylor B,"General John A. Logan didn't rate the kind of adoration and attention afforded to General Ulysses S. Grant. But, like Grant, he was Illinois-born, a hero of the Civil War and an outstanding political figure. Today, their large outdoor bronze sculptures are among Chicago's most recognizable attractions. Logan's monument was created by sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Alexander Phimister Proctor and noted architect Stanford White and dedicated on July 22, 1897. It was installed at 337 East Randolph Street, in Grant Park, east of South Michigan Avenue at East 9th Street. Curiously, Grant's monument is located in Lincoln Park. Also, curiously, Logan's monument, with flag raised in his right hand, sits atop a hill-like tomb that had been intended as the burial place for Logan and his wife. After Logan died in 1886, the Chicago memorial was established. His wife planned to have his remains moved to Chicago from Washington DC after her death. But it never happened and the tomb has always been empty. Logan served in the Mexican-American War and was a division commander in Grant's army during the Civil War. Later, he practiced law and served several terms as an Illinois State Representative and U.S. Congressman. He was nominated for Vice President on John Blaine's failed Presidential ticket in 1884 and, as head of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union Army veterans, he recommended the creation of Memorial Day, which was first observed on May 30, 1868. More recently, Logan's monument was the scene of anti-Vietnam War protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.",Gen. John Logan Memorial,June 2019,50
One of the many Chicago sculptures,Neta_Avivi,"Located in Grant Park, this is a huge outdoor bronze statue of General John Logan.

Historic,L H,"Built in 1957 by architect Maurice Webster, financed by Hammond Organ inventor Laurens Hammond, with sculpture by Boris Gilbertson - this was a gift to the city of Chicago. Sadly, people are not often found playing chess here, and the lake wind & weather have worn away the statues, but it's still one of the city's unique landmarks, and provides some much-needed shade along the lake path.",Chess Pavilion,November 2018,40
Poignant reminder of man’s inhumanity to man,CollRr,"The Killing Fields are a scary reminder of how inhumane humans can be. As you arrive in the park, you are confronted by fields with pathways through them and a tower filled with human skulls. While many bodies have been unearthed from here, our guide showed us how if you put water on the ground more bones show up. Every time it rains, more bones are found. Perhaps the most devastating was the tree against which children were dashed to death. Every turn in the park is a reminder of the potential we all have for cruelty. Entering the tower filled with skulls, and placing a flower in the urn outside the door is filled with solemnity. This is a crucial part of Cambodia’s history. It is a heartbreaking visit, akin to visiting Auschwitz, but a must do to understand more about humans and history.",National Cambodian Heritage Museum & Killing Fields Memorial,May 2019,50
An Excellent Museum With A Valuable Lesson To Teach,Michael W,"The National Cambodian Heritage Museum in Chicago is a very good place to learn about one of recent history's terrible chapters, the period when Cambodia was ruled by the Khmer Rouge in the 1970's.

But this modest shrine with authentic memorabilia and relics is worth visiting.  The museum is small and no docent services were available.  The exhibits were  labelled well, so one could understand what was on display.  The church is beautiful, quiet, and prayerful.  There is an outstanding pamphlet that explains all that is within.  Of note is the display in the altar of one of Mother Cabrini's arm bones.",National Shrine of St. Frances Xavier Cabrini,April 2018,40

Better to shop online,Linda R,"Primitive has beautiful items. You will enjoy your visit if you treat it like a museum, but not a store.

I almost bought a string of African glass beads for $125 and found there are hundreds of identical strands available for under $20. The African movie posters, which Primitive sells for a hefty price, are all available online for under $250.

Different plants are in bloom each time and the outdoor plants get more and more lush as the summer goes on and turns into Fall.    The Monet garden changes its color pallet with the seasons.   The water lilies are lovely.    The last time we brought a lunch and ate it in the splendor of the outdoor garden.

Grant sitting with his typical expression of repose while astride his favorite horse, Cincinnati, a Kentucky thoroughbred. While some criticized the work of sculptor Louis T. Rebisso, which was dedicated in 1891, Grant's eldest son Frederick described it as the ""most satisfactory"" of any of the portraits of his father. The historically accurate details include the field glasses on his right hand, the hat, uniform, spurs, saddle and holster. The statue is located west of North Cannon Drive between West Fullerton Avenue and East North Avenue, adjacent to Lincoln Park Zoo. The dedication ceremony was attended by an estimated 200,000 people. Twenty bands played the ""Star Spangled Banner.""

"Great balls of fire, a little known cultural gem",Taylor B,"The Fire Museum of Chicago is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the fourth Saturday of every month. Located at 5218 South Western Avenue, in the former quarters of Engine Company 123, it was established in 1997 to preserve the history and tradition of the fire service in and around Chicago. It's a little known cultural gem that celebrates the Chicago Fire Department and First Responders. My wife and I have toured the old 1916 building in the past and we planned to make a return visit on October 26. Love the old-time exhibits, including Engine 10 (1928 Ahrens Fox), Squad 10 (1930 White Motors), the speaking trumpet, Pompier ladder, sliding pole, fire plug, box card, old leather fire buckets, hand-drawn hose cart, dozens of firefighter helmets and jackets, street corner fire boxes, firefighting equipment, wall mounted wood peg fire map of the city and the Joker Stand, the communications hub that routed firefighters to blazes, and a tabletop-sized scale model of Our Lady of the Angels School, where a 1958 fire killed 92 children and three nuns in one of Chicago's greatest tragedies. One of the gems of the collection of helmets is one belonging to Michael J. Corrigan, city fire commissioner from 1937 to 1955, and a giant mural of Corrigan fighting a fire, which used to hang in City Hall. Another prize is the almost floor-to-ceiling statue of Christopher Columbus from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, salvaged from a fire in the Fair's Cold Storage Building.",Fire Museum of Chicago,October 2019,50

Not what I expected and exceeded expectations,go-cubbers,"So my son had to see a play for school. We bought these tickets and drove from the southside to the northside so he can get this play in. I knew the story, our town, and thought he might enjoy it. Getting to the theater was easy. Once we got in it was like nothing I’ve ever experienced and can’t wait to make the trek again from the southside to do this theater. Great work to all the actors and directors.

Honoring the first Chicago resident,Neta_Avivi,"Jean-Baptiste Pointe DuSable was born in Haiti and considered as the first citizen of Chicago.

Remembering Chicago’s Founder,patshea2016,"Walking along Chicago’s  Magnificent Mile a couple of days ago, I noticed the monument to the founder of Chicago, Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable.  It is just north of the bridge, on the east side of Michigan Avenue.  The bust of Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable was created by Erik Blome.  In 2009, while  Richard M. Daley was Mayor of Chicago, this bust was given to the city of Chicago by Lesly Benodin, who was born in Haiti.  Since Jean Baptiste Pointe Du Sable opened the first trading post near the Chicago River in the 1770’s, the location of this monument is quite appropriate.  It is in this area that Chicago was established.",DuSable Monument,November 2019,50

Dedicated to interpreting the arts and culture of the Puerto Rican people,Taylor B,"Chicago has a large and proud and ever-growing Puerto Rican community so it makes sense that it should have a National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture. Which it does. Located at 3015 West Division Street, it was established in 2001 and has been situated at its current address since 2009. Dedicated to interpreting the arts and culture of the Puerto Rican people and of the Puerto Ricans in Chicago, it is housed in the historic landmark Humboldt Park stables and receptory, near the Pasco Boricua. It hosts visual arts exhibitions, community education and festivals. Its exhibitions have featured the artwork of Osvaldo Budet, Elizam Escobar, Antonio Martorell, Famon Frade Leon and Lizette Cruz in addition to Chicago or Puerto Rican artists. The museum also sponsors music events, including an annual Navi-Jazz performance described as a ""fusion of Puerto Rican and African American musical elements."" The museum complex and Humboldt Park were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The iconic building was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2008. Of a significant note, the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture is the only self-standing museum in the nation devoted to showcasing Puerto Rican arts and cultural exhibitions year-round. Visitors will enter through the dramatic brick archway of the original carriage receptory into a magnificent brick courtyard adorned with mosaic artwork depicting the island of Puerto Rico and many of its cultural elements. The courtyard is surrounded on all sides by the unique Queen Anne architectural features of the former stables. Each room in the stables has been transformed into part of a fully functional museum. The president and chief executive officer of the museum is Billy Ocasio, who has been an active member of the local Puerto Rican community since he was a highly talented baseball player at Clemente High School. Later, he served his community as an alderman in Chicago's city council. Through the leadership of Ocasio and others, the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture has given people from all walks of life an opportunity to explore and appreciate the beauty, intensity and tradition of Puerto Rican art and culture in a truly historic and architectural treasure on Chicago's West Side.",National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture,November 2018,50

So why not a Pizza Museum in Chicago?,Taylor B,"Chicago is a pizza town. It is the home of deep dish and nobody makes better thin crust pizza than Chicagoans. And Chicago is a town of museums. So it makes sense for Chicago to have a pizza museum. And it does. Located at 1146 South Delano Court West, the United States Pizza Museum is the dream of Kendall Bruns, who founded the museum in 2015. Its mission is to inspire curiosity and new ways of thinking about the rich history and recent developments in the world of pizza by collecting, preserving, interpreting and exhibiting pizza-related items. The museum is open from 1 to 8 on Friday and 11 to 6 on Saturday and Sunday. It can be found at the Roosevelt Collection, an outdoor shopping plaza located in Chicago's South Loop. The 2,910-square-foot space features all forms of pizza memorabilia, pizza-related menus, vintage advertisements, toys and t-shirts and pizza-inspired artwork. Bruns was inspired to pursue his dream of opening a museum wholly dedicated to pizza by watching the development and growth of museums like the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum and the Design Museum of Chicago. He also was inspired by Philadelphia's Pizza Brain, the world's first pizza museum which was opened in 2012 by Brian Dwyer, the Guinness World Record Holder for the largest pizza memorabilia collection. Interestingly, since Bruns opened his museum in Chicago, a number of other pizza-related museums have popped up across the country, including New York and Los Angeles. It only has inspired Bruns to continue to collect more items to fill his growing museum. He insists that pizza is such a fascinating and popular subject that it deserves more than one or two museums to showcase its significance. It certainly deserves a museum in Chicago, the town that made pizza famous.",United States Pizza Museum,October 2018,50
Interesting,Shannon J,This was a fun small museum. It was in a shopping area and kind of hard to find. It was pretty interesting learning about the history of pizza in America.

Beautiful!,GramC8410,The Chicago Architecture Foundation bus tour stops here first.  What a way to begin a look at Chicago architecture!  We were there on a Saturday morning so it was very quiet and we were limited to standing in the foyer and looking up and around as our docent spoke.  It is a beautiful space - full of natural light.  There are so many fascinating architectural elements.  So glad this was on the tour!  Be sure you ask about how it got its name.  I highly recommend visiting this building and going on a tour if possible.,The Rookery Building,April 2018,50

Historic Building Beautifully Restored,maisoui_27,"I went on the 45 minute Chicago Architecture Tour of this building; now a hotel.  A very important 1895 historic building in Chicago that has been beautifully restored.  Clad in glass and terra cotta it was the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows.  The elevator shaft, mosaic tile floor, narrow staircase with worn marble treads, old wooden doors to the rooms with letter slots, and more.  All of these things make this a unique building to stay in Chicago.  We were lucky to be able to go inside a room on the tour and I was impressed by the beauty and quality of the rooms.  I would stay here given the opportunity.",Reliance Building,July 2017,40
A First in the Skyscraper Evolution,Feenixwest,Saw this on a historic walking tour of Chicago. It was a first skyscraper to have as much window-space as this--70% which was very scary when this was built.

It looks like it used to be a beautiful place but it looks neglected now and unsafe,O6378WFannag,"So I decided to have a walk around this park during my lunch brake. But let me tell you I did not feel safe here. First of all I felt everyone is looking at me when I parked and left my car to see lagoon. There were only male adults in the park. No female no children. Second of all I only saw a lot of groups of male gathered in different locations around the park which looked liked drug dealers or gang members. Even driving around them was very creepy experience. I felt like they looking at me constantly becasue I was driving and stopping around the lagoon and leaving my car for few minutes to take some pictures of lagoon, park and trees. People don't do that  in this area. I looked very suspicious. I think if I read about this park and neighborhood in advance before my visit I would not dare to come here on my own or at all. Now I know that this neighborhood is consider the most dangerous in the city. A lot of gangs around and they can jump you in the broad daylight.",Douglas Park,May 2016,20

There is a colorful & striking monument worth viewing in front of the museum. The museum is very small, there are 3 floors. The first floor is the most interesting & displays a few items related to the worn by or carried by the Pullman Porters.  On the 3rd floor they play a 20 minute video on the Pullman Porter & A Phillip Randolph which is fascinating but then there is not much to the rest of the museum. They say they have 150,000 artifacts in storage but less than 20 are on display . Those 20 or less items on display are all on the first floor entry, they are great  & make you want to see more historical items but there aren't any. They do have some black & white historical photos on the walls which are interesting but both the wall and floor space could be better used.",A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum,April 2017,30

Impressive sculpture ,chad_a_wr,We walked over to Washington Park while we were at the University of Chicago campus. The fountain is nice with Father Time looking over a progression of human emotions. ,Fountain of Time,June 2015,50
Must-see sculpture on the Midway,Taylor B,"I must have visited the University of Chicago campus more than a dozen times, including the Midway and Rockefeller Chapel and the site of the old football stadium (site of the first nuclear reaction, prelude to the Manhattan Project), before someone asked: ""Have you seen the Fountain of Time?"" Imagine my embarrassment. How could you miss it? The Fountain of Time, a massive and mythic sculpture by Lorado Taft, is located at 5900 South Cottage Grove Avenue in Chicago's Washington Park. It is situated on the western edge of the grassy expanse known as the Midway Plaisance with the University of Chicago campus to the east. The massive monument, which is 126 feet, 10 inches in length, was inspired by Henry Austin Dobson's poem, ""Paradox of Time."" Constructed from a new type of molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more durable and cheaper than the alternatives, the fountain's water began running in 1920 but the sculpture was not dedicated to the city until 1922. It is a monument to the first 100 years of peace between the United States and Great Britain resulting from the Treaty of Ghent in 1814. Funded by Benjamin Ferguson's 1905 gift of $1 million ($26.3 million in today's dollars), the sculpture depicts a hooded Father Time carrying a scythe and watching over a parade of 100 figures arranged in an ellipse. Taft's figures, which include soldiers, frolicking children and kissing couples, represent birth, the struggle for existence, love, religion, family life, poetry and war. Taft and one of his assistants are represented among the figures rushing through stages of life and displaying a progression of human emotions. It is said to be the first of any kind of finished work of art made in concrete. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is an awe-inspiring sight, one that is often overlooked by visitors who enter and exit the campus from the east on their way to and from Lake Shore Drive. Next time, drive all the way to the end of the Midway. You'll enjoy the view.",Fountain of Time,January 2016,50
Musicians overpower in this Sondheim production,Travellers1970,"In a Sondheim show it's important to hear the lyrics as they build a character by defining the person, their motivation and move the plot line. I saw the original production in NYC with Donna Murphy playing Fosca so knew the story, the music and lyrics. If I didn't have this background I would have been lost at this production. It's one of Sondheim best shows so if you haven't seen it go but don't sit near the musicians. Danni Smith is a very good Fosca. A great voice…..when you can hear her...and strong stage presence in this difficult role. We saw the final dress rehearsal so hopefully the rest of the cast will settle into their role and the musicians will tone it down a notch.",Theo Ubique Cabaret Theatre,March 2014,40
From ooze to muck,Rolf A,"An amazing 126 feet (38.66 m) of sculpture by Lorado Taft that is well worth the trek to the western edge of the Midway Plaisance, that stretch of green from Jackson Park to Washington Park. The sculpture shows some 100 figures passing before Father Time. It shows humanity rising form primal ooze, soldiering along until grief stricken drop into the muck. The monument celebrates the Treaty of Ghent and the 100 years of peace between the US and Great Britain. The fountain was finished in 1920 and dedicated in 1922.",Fountain of Time,January 2016,50
A monument to the refutation of Nazi ideology,Taylor B,"Located in Chicago's Washington Park, at 5900 South Cottage Grove Avenue, at the west end of the University of Chicago's Midway Plaisance, on a 367-acre expanse designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, stands Lorado Taft's Fountain of Time. It is the only realized portion of Taft's grand beautification scheme for the Midway Plaisance, a mile-long and 220-yard-wide area linking Washington and Jackson Parks on Chicago's South Side. The work is not a fountain but a massive 110-foot-long sculptural relief of 100 figures behind a pool of water, traveling from birth to death before a 16-foot-tall mantled figure representing Time. Taft died in 1936 before finishing the model. One of his students, Leonard Crunelle, completed the monument. Standing more than 11 feet tall, George Washington is shown wearing his Commander-in-Chief campaign clothes with the Continental three-cornered hat. The monument, which stood as a refutation of Nazi ideology, was dedicated on December 15, 1941 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who described the work as a ""great triumvirate of patriots."" The massive base features a bronze, bas-relief plaque that depicts as assemblage of people of various professions, ethnicities and backgrounds gathered beneath a seated Goddess of Liberty with outstretched arms.",Fountain of Time,April 2019,50

A beautiful fieldhouse,Allen21096,"They just do not design and build park field houses like they used to.  In 1928, the West Park Commission constructed the ""Gold Dome Building"" in Garfield Park to provide a new administrative headquarters for the West Park Commission.  In 1934, the West Park Commission and the 21 other independent park commissions were merged in to the Chicago Park District and the field house, became just that - a field house for Garfield Park.  The building itself houses a gymnasium, auditorium, dance studio, fitness center, boxing center, grand ballroom and meeting rooms.  Garfield Park, itself,  totals 184.72 acres and features the historic Golden Dome field house.  There are two lagoons and the park is just south of the Garfield Park Conservatory.

And from now until August 25, it will be home to artist Rob Pruitt's first exhibit of The Obama Paintings, commemorating the 10th anniversary of President Barack Obama's first inauguration and portraying each day of his time in office. Located at 6760 South Stony Island Avenue, a mile from the future Obama Presidential Center, the Stony Island Arts Bank was chosen by the former President to host the inaugural meeting of the Obama Foundation Fellows last May. Designed by William Gibbons Uffendell and built in 1923, the bank was once a vibrant community savings and loan. By the 1980s, it had closed and the building remained vacant for decades. In 2015, the restored building was reopened as a neighborhood community center and destination for scholars, artists, curators and collectors to research and engage in the history of Chicago's South Side. The Obama Paintings document such seminal events as the President's first State of the Union address to seemingly mundane activities like walks on the front lawn of the White House with the family dog. Other collections include Johnson Publishing Company, publisher of Ebony and Jet magazines, and the University of Chicago glass lantern slides, over 60,000 slides of art and architectural history from the Paleolithic to Modern eras.",Stony Island Arts Bank,April 2019,50

"Mixture of mansions, high-rises and culture",Taylor B,"For years, I lived in the far western suburbs, in the affluent communities of Wheaton and Glen Ellyn.Then I moved to the Gold Coast. There is no comparison. I'd never move back. Chicago's Gold Coast Historic District is bordered by North Avenue on the north, Oak Street on the south, Lake Shore Drive on the east and Clark Street on the west. In between is a mixture of mansions, row houses, high-rise apartments, classy restaurants, exclusive department stores and boutiques, landmark buildings and art galleries. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places i 1978. It is one of the most affluent neighborhoods in the United States. The Gold Coast grew in the wake of the Great Chicago Fire. In 1882, millionaire hotel owner Potter Palmer moved to the area from the fashionable Prairie Avenue neighborhood on the city's south side. He built the Palmer Mansion, a 42-room castle-like structure, on Lake Shore Drive. Other wealthy Chicagoans followed. Today, some of the highlights of the Gold Coast include the Astor Street District, the James Charnley House, the Chicago Archdiocese's Mansion, the Chicago History Museum, the Oak Street shopping district, Oak Street Beach and the Rush Street restaurant corridor. The Gold Coast is adjacent to Lincoln Park and Streeterville. The strone mansions along State Street and Astor Street that date to the late 1800s evoke a sense of history and give the impression of permanence and wealth. A leisurely stroll through the neighborhood provides an up-close glimpse of the city's oldest and most unique architecture. For example, the Charnley House at 1365 North Astor is known as ""the first modern house in America."" A national landmark, it was designed by Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. People living in the Gold Coast neighborhood are within walking distance of downtown shopping, of Water Tower Place and the Magnificent Mile, museums and theaters, Lincoln Park Zoo and Millennium Park, and all things Chicago has to offer. It sure beats a two-hour commute from the suburbs.",Gold Coast Historic District,May 2016,50

"Nice facade remaining, but sadly that's about all.",neville g,"Not knowing anything about Dearborn station, but having seen the name on the front of the building from way up the other end of a street, we walked up and had a look around. It was very disappointing that none of the various shops inside, even one specialising photography, had even a post card of how the station looked originally, let lone any obvious history board describing the way the station functioned. While walking through the  attractive parklands behind the building, which were once railway platforms and tracks, we had no idea, until arriving home in Australia and doing a search on Google, how extensive the area of railway activity once was. There should at the very minimum be an easily locatable information and photographic section within the restored building so that visitors can be informed as to the history of the site otherwise it doesn't mean all that much.",Dearborn Station,October 2014,30

How many people remember Dearborn Station?,Taylor B,"As a 79-year-old retiree, I remember when railroads were more popular than airlines. I recall riding on the Rock Island Railroad from my home in south suburban Blue Island to the La Salle Street Station on Van Buren Street in downtown Chicago. And then there was the nearby Dearborn Station, also referred to as the Polk Street Station, which was the oldest of the six intercity train stations serving downtown Chicago. Located at Dearborn and Polk Streets, adjacent to Printers Row, the three-story, Romanesque Revival structure with the 12-story clock tower opened in 1885. Inside the pink granite and red brick building were the train platforms, a large train shed, ticket counters, waiting rooms and Fred Harvey Company restaurants. By 1920, Dearborn Station served as a terminal for 25 railway lines, serving 17,000 passengers daily on 122 trains. By 1976, the train shed was demolished and tracks were removed. The train station stood abandoned into the mid-1980s, then was converted into a shopping mall with retail shops, restaurants, bars and entertainment venues. Remember when it was incorrectly referred to as ""Dearborn Street Station"" in a 1974 episode of M*A*S*H in which Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) craves the BBQ ribs from a fictional restaurant adjacent to the station. Dearborn Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and designated a Chicago Landmark in 1982.",Dearborn Station,November 2019,50

They have a parking lot, but we parked on the street. It's a little tricky to get to with construction and the gps, but we found it. The only negative I could say about the theater is that the chairs aren't comfy after about 30 minutes. I would invest in some new chairs as I had to keep switching positions, but other than that no complaints. Don't go in expecting a Broadway spectacular performance, but go in expecting actors that work hard and care about putting on a good show and you'll be satisfied.

Proud to be a Gold Coast resident,Taylor B,"I used to live in Streeterville. But for the last 35 years, I have lived on the Gold Coast. I'm not sure there is a difference between the two downtown Chicago neighborhoods. But the names sure make a difference. Streeterville is located on THAT side of Michigan Avenue. The Gold Coast is located on THIS side of Lake Shore Drive. It may sound snobbish but I'm proud to be a resident of the Gold Coast. It is part of Chicago's Near North community, roughly bounded by North Avenue to the north, Oak Street to the south, Lake Shore Drive to the east and Clark Street to the west. Historically, it grew in the wake of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. In 1882, millionaire hotel mogul Potter Palmer moved to the area from the swanky Prairie Avenue neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. He filled in a swampy area which later became Lake Shore Drive and built the Palmer Mansion, or The Castle as it was commonly referred to, a 42-room castle-like structure designed by Henry Ives Cobb and Charles Sumner Frost, at 1350 North Lake Shore Drive, at the corner of North Lake Shore Drive and Banks Street. Other wealthy Chicagoans followed Palmer into the neighborhood, which quickly became one of the richest in Chicago. In the late 1980s, the Gold Coast and neighborhood Streeterville comprised the second most affluent neighborhood in the United States, behind Manhattan's Upper East Side. Today, the Gold Coast is a mixture of mansions, row houses and high-rise apartments, including the Astor Street District and the James Charnley House and the Robert Lincoln House and the Cardinal's residence. The Gold Coast Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. As of 2011, the Gold Coast ranked as the seventh richest urban neighborhood in the United States with a median household income of $153,358.",Gold Coast Historic District,November 2018,50
"Home, Sweet Home",Taylor B,"My earliest memory of the Gold Coast was driving past the magnificent Potter Palmer Mansion at 1350  North Lake Shore Drive before it was demolished in 1950. Built in 1882-1885 for the hotel magnate, it once was the largest private residence in Chicago. Another memory of the Gold Coast was driving past Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion on North State Parkway after our senior prom in 1958. Now my wife and I live on the Gold Coast. Part of Chicago's Near North Side community, the Gold Coast is bounded by North Avenue, Lake Shore Drive, Oak Street and Clark Street. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and generally is regarded as the nation's second most affluent neighborhood behind Manhattan's Upper East Side. Credit goes to Potter Palmer. In 1982, in the wake of the Great Chicago Fire, Palmer moved from the Prairie Avenue neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, filled in a swampy area which later became Lake Shore Drive and built the Palmer Mansion, a 42-room castle-like structure. Others followed Palmer to the neighborhood. Today, the most famous resident of the Gold Coast is current Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker. The Gold Coast Historic District includes the Latin School of Chicago, one of the nation's most prestigious private schools, Chicago History Museum, Newberry Library, the historic James Charnley House, the elite Oak Street shopping district, North Avenue Beach and Oak Street Beach.",Gold Coast Historic District,August 2019,50

One of the largest greenhouse conservatories in the United States,Taylor B,"Garfield Park Conservatory is one of the largest greenhouse conservatories in the United States. Located at 300 North Central Park Avenue, in Garfield Park, on Chicago's West Side, it is often referred to as ""landscape art under glass"" because it occupies approximately 4.5 acres inside and out and contains a number of permanent plant exhibits incorporating specimens from around the world, including some cycads that are over 200 years old. Along with the Lincoln Park Conservatory on Chicago's North Side, the Garfield Park Conservatory provides significant horticultural collections, educational programs and community outreach efforts. In the 1880s, each of the three large West Side parks--Garfield, Humboldt and Douglas--had its own conservatory and propagation greenhouses. After 20 years of use, however, they fell into a state of disrepair and had become obsolete. In 1905, the three greenhouses were demolished and Chicago's West Park Commission's general superintendent and chief landscape architect Jens Jensen decided to create ""the largest publicly owned conservatory under one roof in the world"" in Garfield Park. Constructed between 1906 and 1907, the Garfield Park Conservatory represents a unique collaboration of architects, engineers, landscape architects, sculptors and artisans. Jensen conceived the conservatory as a series of naturalistic landscapes under glass, a revolutionary concept at the time. The simple yet strong shape of the structure, which is meant to emulate the haystacks of the Midwest, complements the collection of plants and foliage that it houses. Today, the conservatory still follows the original tenets of Jensen. One of the most popular rooms is the first presented to visitors, the Palm Room, where over seven dozen varieties of palm trees can be found from the over 2,700 known to exist today. In 2012, the conservatory won the National Medal for Museum and Library Services. In 2018, it was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois.",Garfield Park Conservatory,November 2018,50
CBS classic ,tclements73,We made a trip to the United center for the cbs classic. NCAA basketball. Before I get to the the actual arena let’s talk about parking. We had great parking and paid for it. The only difference is nobody checked to see if I even purchased a parking pass. The lady wouldn’t get out of the car and waved people in. Nice I see I could’ve passed on the parking price and parked for free in the same spot.  I went to Fiserv forum and my parking pass was checked. Just saying. Now to the United center. I thought the arena was very nice. The food subpar and over priced. I needed water tho. But paying $4.75 for water was kind of ridiculous. The Giordannos pizza that I got was horrible. I have add a real giordannos before or twice and this one was nasty. The views from the seat were great. Overall it’s a great arena. ,United Center,December 2018,50

There is a special service on the United Center app, but annoyingly it isn’t available to overseas customers.. facilities were good, security to get in was well organised (find it so strange that they have signs everywhere reminding no weapons allowed). The game was great - though the music and horns are very loud (husband found it particularly eye squint worthy). Great fun.",United Center,December 2018,40

The house is in the midst of renovation (so one could not see the kitchen or dining room, other than from the doorway to the dining room.) Still, the angles of the rooms, and the windows and glass, as well as the parts of the house that have already been renovated made the tour worthwhile. It is a great piece of architecture and if you are ever near the University of Chicago (who owns the property) you should stop and see this magnificent piece of architecture.

"Nice pic there, but it's not the Argyle Street we are talking of",DebbieandDoug,"WOW. I will try to be concise.  I grew up in the hood.  It was a deteriorating area. A very successful Chinese restauranteur from the traditional Chinatown bought out essentially both sides of the street between Sheridan and Broadway to foster a new 'Chinatown North'.  Then, with the end of the Viet Nam war and the influx of Vietnamese, the street took another turn. Now the street is a fantastic melange of flavors and smells.  Gift shops, bakeries, restaurants, groceries, and the remnant of the old days Foremost Liquors. Come hungry and curious. ps the parking is tough, so simply be prepared to park a bit away to the west, and stroll over. Don't even try to park on Argyle proper, or east, as parking is tough there too.  The neighborhood is fine.  Park on Carmen, Winona, or Winnemac.  No safety issues.",Argyle street,October 2013,50

Chicago's equivalent of Harlem,conrade886,"I'd been here when living in Chicago looking at historical neighborhoods there and was interested in this one due to its comparisons to Harlem in New York City as the historical Black district of Chicago, the first of the South Side neighborhoods there. Bronzeville isn't nearly as large and thriving as I have read it to be in past times but it certainly has several landmarks signifying it's place in Chicago's Black history to remind those unfamiliar with it of its historical importance. It appears to have had some gentrification in it as it does sit between the University areas and the South Loop but unlike other gentrified areas, it has not lost its overall character (Harlem, the neighborhood it is most often compared to has). Its housing stock is some larger brownstone type rowhouses or short multi unit apartment buildings with the wooden exterior staircases known throughout Chicago. It doesnt have as many bars or nightclubs as other neighborhoods but has some decent restaurants in it (Chicago's Chicken and Waffles at Pershing and MLK is a good one). It can be accessed by the Green Line El Train, the Main North-South streets in the Loop (State, Michigan, Indiana), and the Dan Ryan Expressway at the exits for US Cellular Field.

Traffic from Hell!,Shari2019,"I went to the UIC Pavilion for a 7:00 concert on a Saturday night primarily to see Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant.  I did not get to the vicinity of Harrison and Racine until around 6:45 p.m.  The traffic was HORRIBLE.  It took me over 1 hour from the time I was a block away from the UIC Pavilion to get inside the venue and sit in my seat.  I was on Racine just trying to get to Harrison and traffic was at a STANDSTILL.  I maneuvered around some side streets and got on Harrison which was moving better than Racine but still moving very slow. Traffic control in the area needs to be much better.  By the time I crossed the intersection of Harrison and Racine and was in front of the Pavilion, it was probably 7:30.  I then found that all the UIC parking on Harrison was FULL.  I just kept creeping along on Harrison until I got to Halsted.  I then turned right (south) and once I got to the area of Halsted and Polk, I found some more UIC parking.  The location was about 2 miles from the UIC Pavilion and it still cost $20.  Fortunately they had free shuttles to take you to and from the UIC Pavilion.  Once we were packed like sardines in the shuttle it took off and dropped us off right in front of the UIC Pavilion.  It was around 7:45 at that time.  The lines were still long to get into the Pavilion. Fortunately I was able to get in within 10 minutes and was in my seat by 8:00. Unfortunately I had totally missed Ralph Tresvant and I only got to see Johnny Gill sing the end of his last song.  I was so disappointed.  The main reason I went to the concert was to see Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant as I grew up listening to them and love to see them perform.  The O'Jays did pretty good and Frankie Beverly and Maze seemed to perform okay.  I don't really know their music (Frankie Beverly and Maze) so I can't really comment too much on their performance.  The seats at the UIC Pavilion are plastic and hard; they feel like any other sport arena's seats.  You might want to bring some cushion because after a couple hours, the seats really get uncomfortable.  Also, if you are more than average size, you may not be able to squeeze into the seats as they are small.  Given that people so rudely stand during the entire concert, I would not recommend getting seats on the floor, I would go up one level.  I think that row F or higher is a good selection for seats and preferably at or near the end of the aisle.  My sister and I were in section C (row 113 I think). If we had been up a few more rows, I think we would have been able to see better despite folks standing.  Overall I had a good time just hanging out with my sister and seeing a concert but I have learned a lesson; especially about the UIC Pavilion. For concerts (I can't speak to other events) on a Saturday night, you must plan to get their early or make other accommodations to get there because driving your car there and trying to get a park is horrible!  I would strongly recommend getting to the UIC Pavilion area no later than 5:30. That should give you time to deal with any traffic, find parking by the UIC Pavilion, get through security and get to your seat before the concert starts.  If you can't get to the UIC Pavilion 1 1/2 hours prior to the start of the concert and you are driving, I would suggest parking on the street; maybe up to a mile away and getting an UBER to get you close to the UIC Pavilion and then walk a couple of blocks.  It will save you tons of time and frustration.  ",UIC Pavilion,February 2019,20

Parking was a mess and they made people wait outside too long before they opened the doors so I was subjected to second hand marijuana smoke and standing in heels. However, even though I had a bad experience, I decided to give it one more chance because I am a huge New Edition and Babyface fan. It rained really hard the day of the concert. We had balcony seats but we could see that the roof had leaked and there were huge puddles of water on the floor. People were walking through water to get to their seats which were also in water. UIC did not try to clean up the water. People were buying food and liquor before the show started. So an hour later a comedian came on stage to tell the audience that the show was cancelled due to the rain. UIC is wrong for having people spend money on food and liquor only to cancel the show. They didn't even give refunds for parking! They said in a few days they will release the dates for another show and they will honor our tickets! Whatever, I won't be there! UIC is raggedy and not worth the trouble!",UIC Pavilion,July 2016,10

Great time--but UNHEALTHFULLY TOO LOUD!,charlesthebarles,"Husband & I had a great time at an UIC-VALPARAISO college basketball game Dec. 30. A pre-lunch BBQ we attended sponsored by the Chicago Valpo Alumni Club was handled beautifully upstairs. Seats in the arena were more comfortable than typical bleacher seating. View was exceptional. It would have helped to have full scoreboards at both baskets (or in the middle), rather than on just the one side. But that's just quibbling. The factor that made it tough was the *EXTREME* volume of *NOISE* unhealthy for all ears. THE THUMPING BLARING MUSIC DID NOT ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE!!! Please, UIC, TONE IT DOWN!!!",UIC Pavilion,December 2016,30

Frozen in Time,neverlandalice,"This area is a bit run-down.  Somehow it reminds people of what the old times were like when the printing business was thriving.  Chicago is not only for finance or tourism, there were and still are lots of  different  trades going on.  Of course, the old-fashioned printing is already replaced by electronic or updated techniques, however, the remaining structures here are still standing tall as if  telling a proud history of itself and how the printers did their good jobs to bring more knowledge and information to this world.  The worn buildings have some fascinating beauty difficult to describe, in my opinion.  For a foreign visitor like me, this location in south Loop has a lot to offer.  No magnificent shopping centers, no fancy restaurants, what is left here  is the  year-gone-by flavor.  Very special and irreplaceable.",Printers Row,December 2012,30

Needs work,Larry S,"I attended a college basketball game over the holidays. Now a total picture is needed to be fair. Chicago is a college basketball desert.  The glory days of DePaul and Loyola are long gone. Even Northwestern,  which is actually in Evanston, is mediocre at best. The idea behind the Pavillion was to provide a top notch inner city arena for a top notch program. The UIC Flames are less than mediocre this year. The original seating capacity has been reduced , meaning it is small enough to be a reasonable venue for sports and concerts. There is nothing especially fancy or special about it. My review is about concessions. This is an area seemingly not even thought about by the designers. A few simple stands are provided. Crowds are usually small at games, especially when the students are on hiatus. There was only one food stand open. I was about the tenth person in line. This led to about a twenty minutes wait for food as service was extremely slow. But worst part was that the food was absolutely awful, which is saying a lot for someone who has endured a lifetime of ballpark food. The sandwich I had was limp and soggy. I don't know which was limper- the meat or the bun. I ended up throwing out most of the fries before I threw up. Someone at UIC should realize that if the school cannot provide a quality basketball program, maybe they should at least attempt to provide a decent eating experience. This is a downtown public arena in a city supposedly known for fine meats, especially hot dogs. Unfortunately,  this place is a blot on the city for both service and food quality.",UIC Pavilion,December 2015,10

Chicago's first moveable bridge,Taylor B,"The Dearborn Street Bridge that spans the Chicago River in downtown Chicago has two histories. The 1834 bridge was the first moveable bridge built in Chicago when the town had a population of 350. It was the primary crossing point over the river for the original town. But it turned out to be an unreliable nuisance that was dismantled in 1839. There was no crossing at Dearborn Street until 1888 when the existing Wells Street swing bridge was floated up river and installed at Dearborn Street. It was replaced in 1907 by a Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge. In 1962, it was replaced by the current bridge, which received the ""Most Beautiful Steel Bridge"" award in the Moveable Span category by the American Institute of Steel Construction in 1963.",Dearborn Street Bridge,May 2019,50

Then I actually learned about this bridge by reading the TripAdvisor reviews.  I won't rehash those.  My issue is that if this bridge has such historical significance, then shouldn't there be signage on both side commemorating it.

Great neighborhood park - a part of Chicago history,Lincoln D,"I grew up in Chicago until I was 12 years.  I left the West Rogers Park neighborhood in 1974, when my family moved to Southern California.  I have very fond memories of Indian Boundary Park.  We would go there all the time as children, since it was only 4 or 5 blocks from our house.  We would see the animals that were there.  Feed the ducks and the deer.  Run around the park with our friends.  Ride our bikes there.  I visited there recently on a business trip to Chicago.  It brought back a lot of wonderful memories.  What great parks Chicago has.  Indian Boundary Park has a lot of memories.  My dad passed away in 1997 at the age of 84.  He lived in this neighborhood for a majority of his life.  His family moved up to Rogers Park from the South Side when he was a small child.

Interesting ,Denise_GoIrish,"As a part of a tour, we went to the Stockyard. The kids found the arch interesting and read the fact plaque. The head of the bull on the arch was a good story. The firefighters memorial there also was well placed. ",Union Stockyard Gate,September 2016,40
Important part of Chicago history,Taylor B,"I remember driving past the old Chicago Stock Yards when they were thriving in the 1950s, when my uncle was a foreman in Swift's meatpacking plant, when thousands of people worked there, when you could smell that awful smell all over Chicago's South Side. I remember smelling the stockbyards when attending a game at old Comiskey Park. Now the only thing left to remind anyone of the stock yards or the old Stock Yards Inn or the old International Amphitheater on South Halsted Street is the Union Stock Yard Gate. Located on Exchange Avenue at Peoria Street off Halsted near South Union, it was the entrance to the famous Union Stock Yards. The huge limestone gate was designed by John Wellborn Root of Burnham and Root in 1875. Over the arch of the gate, Root included a now famous bust of ""Sherman,"" the favorite prize-winning bull of John B. Sherman. The gate was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1981. Today, you can stand in front of the imposing gate, once the passage for thousands of workers and millions of hogs, and inhale deeply through your nose and not double over in a fit of nausea. Now the site is an industrial yard with only one meatpacking plant and acres of non-food related manufacturing. The smell is gone. But the history remains. Opened on Christmas Day in 1865, the Union Stock Yards grew to over 2,000 hog pens for 75,000 hogs in the 19th century, ensuring Chicago's reputation as ""hot butcher to the world."" The workers were so efficient that a record 190,000 hogs were dismembered in one day and Henry Ford got the idea of an assembly line for his Model T. The horrors within the gate were seared into the minds of the public and the annals of literature in Upton Sinclair's timeless novel ""The Jungle,"" published in 1905. The Union Stock Yards declined in the mid-20th century and closed in 1971. But the gate remains as the only relic of once was the biggest meatpacking complex in the world. Directly behind the gate is a statue honoring the 21 firefighters who died in a  massive 1910 Stock Yards fire that, prior to September 11, 2001, had caused the greatest number of professional firefighter deaths in U.S. history.",Union Stockyard Gate,March 2017,50

A Gem for History Buffs,mother15,"JMJ  Visited this museum, which I have been driving past for years, and finally made up my mind to visit it!  An article in the local newspaper about the exhibit ""Hope and Spirit"" made this my destination this week-end or bust.  Talked  to a good friend and she had also seen the article in different local newspaper and was delighted when I mentioned  I would be going.  Plans were made with our spouses and off we went!!  What a delightful museum.  Even though none of us are of Lithuanian descent, we were made to feel so welcomed by the founder Mr. Balzekas himself!! He personally showed us up to the 3rd fl to see the special exhibit and later showed us the charming Children's Room.  We were also blessed to hear the founder of the special exhibit and why he felt it important to expose people to the Lithuanian deportations suffered under the Soviets in the 1940's and up until the Soviet Union was destroyed by freedom. Everyone is aware of the millions murdered by Hitler, but hardly a word is spoken of the millions killed in Lithuania and surrounding Eastern European countries.  Stalin was a more effective killing machine that Hitler was!  The Hope part comes into play at the Museum also when you see the long history of the Lithuanian people and artifacts from the region going back to prehistoric times.  Remember in the Movie Jurassic Park  -the dinosaur DNA in the amber?? Well there is an terrific display on the famous amber of Lithuania and what has been discovered in reality.  Young children can pretend to be Knights in Lithuania after they cross the drawbridge into the Children's section.

Learning about the Greek heritage,Taylor B,"The National Hellenic Museum at 333 South Halsted in Chicago is the second oldest American institution dedicated to the displaying and celebrating the cultural contributions of Greeks and Greek-Americans. Formerly known as the Hellenic Museum and Cultural Center, the National Hellenic Museum is located in Chicago's Greektown neighborhood, at the corner of Halsted and Van Buren streets. It recently underwent a modernization program that culminated in the museum moving to its current building in December 2011. The 40,000-square-foot museum, which is conveniently located near many outstanding Greek restaurants, houses a vast collection of 18,000 artifacts, 10,000 archival items and 200 oral histories. It was created to promote understanding of the rich cultural traditions of ancient and contemporary Greece, as well as a focus on the Greek-American immigrant experience. It features a unique blend of art and history and portraits of famous Americans of Green heritage. For example, the HOMER Oral History Project documents the Greek immigrant experience in America through the process of interviewing and recording the life stories of individuals of Greek descent. As of 2015, the HOMER Project has more than 300 individual histories, spanning hundreds of hours of film and audio tape. The museum's extensive collection spans the thousands of years of Greek history, with pieces from every period of history from 1,200 BCE through today, including hand-made textiles, traditional costumes, musical instruments and original photographs. The museum's library and archives contain over 10,000 books, including rare volumes, 17th and 18th century manuscripts, newspapers, magazines and other printed documents. Among exhibitions currently on display are: The Greeks: Agamemnon to Alexander the Great; Transcending Boundaries: The Artwork of Anthony Quinn; Aegean: Creation of an Archipelago; Reaching for the American Dream: The Legacy of Green Immigration; Civil Rights and Greek America; and The Story of Greek Independence. It is important for all Americans, whether your heritage is Irish or Polish or African or English or Italian or French or Occidental, to understand all ways of life. I got a good education in the history of Greece when I minored in Ancient History at the University of Illinois. The National Hellenic Museum is like getting a masters degree in the subject.",National Hellenic Museum,December 2015,50
Wonderful!,WasteOfPaintt,"We decided to visit the National Hellenic Museum because it was something a little different than your average art or natural history museum---though the museum incorporated both of these things. They had a wonderful art display in the downstairs gallery, along with natural history in relation to different Greek islands, and a great history exhibit that focused on Greek immigration to the US. We really enjoyed the museum and it is well worth the visit! The staff in the shop is also very welcoming and I enjoyed chatting with them. I'll make another stop there at some point in the future! ",National Hellenic Museum,February 2016,50
Nice,eec317,"Very friendly staff. I did find it a little expensive for what was offered. The exhibits involved a LOT of reading, but there was a large field trip there while I was and the kids all seemed to be having fun. Beautiful building and it seems they change exhibits often.",National Hellenic Museum,March 2016,30

Try it off hours for a chill experience,Karabana,"We were pleased to see that Baderbräu is a short walk from the South Loop hotel we stayed at. When we arrived in the afternoon, we hit Baderbräu @ 3 pm. It was a good relaxing spot for us, very few people were there, it wasn't noisy at that time, and so the service was good. They have much variety to choose from, so we each had their sampler, and I chose a pint of High Noon Hefeweizen. Love the atmosphere and would try the food next time.",Baderbrau Brewery & Tap,December 2016,40

"Interesting sense of humor, Great atmosphere",Dana D,"Their signature show is ""Too much light makes the baby go blind"".  There are 30 short plays performed within 60 minutes and the show in constantly changing.  If you are a person who gets easily embarrassed I would not reccommend this theatre.  However if you're in for a good time and can roll with the punches, I would highly suggest going to see their show! I had a great time and would definitely go back, and it's located in the Andersonville neighborhood so there are plenty of places to grab a drink or dinner before or after the show!",Neo-Futurists,November 2012,40
zany talented people,Mary Jane L,"Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind is hilarious, fast moving, at times poignant, put on by very talented actors and writers doing 30 skits in 60 minutes.

Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind,judyw988,"This show is 30 Plays in 60 Minutes; they all are Improv.  It is said to be the the longest running show in Chicago and the only open-run Off-Off-Broadway show in New York. Starting in 1988, the show has run 50 weekends of the year since then.  It was very interesting to say the least....  I should have looked closer to what it was all about before scheduling our group of 6 ladies as it was a bit over the top for most.  You need to understand Improv's as well as like the strange.  Some of skits were funny, some were sad, some serious, some lovely, and some, most of us ""just did not get"".  But it's important to tell you all about the theater, very old, not fancy in anyway, upstairs, just an experience!!!!   We were in Chicago for the Experience's, we got it here.",Neo-Futurists,November 2013,30

"Interesting place, but bring a raincoat.",Lifeisagr8adventure,"We made reservations for the Sunday evening show and were glad we did as many people in line for standby were not able to get in.  This theater is unique, it was small and a bit cramped and had uncomfortable seats.  The actors were incredible and so energetic, and the 40 short plays (each of which they wrote), that they aspired to perform in one hour turned into about an hour and half, but that was cool.  There was only one thing I didn't like, I felt bad for the people that one cast member sprinkled with a watering can during one of the skits and kept doing it during the last half of the whole show...they would somewhat randomly choose who got watered at the end of each play, but some people got it more than once and were pretty soaked. I hope they take that part out of their next performance...at the end they roll a die to find the number of new plays they will write that week, and replace that number of old plays with the new plays. We enjoyed the performances!",Neo-Futurists,August 2015,40

Incomplete Museum,Darlene43,"Large, new building with very few items on display and little historical information.  Right now, the museum seems geared towards grammar school children with hands on type of exhibits.  Second floor has paint cans and other items showing the museum is under construction and asking for input.  The videos available are very brief with very little information.  Definitely not worth $10 admission (plus cost of parking).",National Hellenic Museum,January 2012,10
"Great Place for our 15, 12, & 8 year olds, though still finishing the upper floors",TravJX3,"This museum built from the ground up and opened in December, 2011, was a great place to go for a day outing for our family's ""stay-cation"" during Spring Break week. Easily accessible by the Blue Line EL /subway (to Forest Park) at the Halsted stop, then walk 3 short blocks east to Halsted Street, the main street of Greek Town Chicago, IL with several great restaurants and bakeries within two blocks of the museum. Museum has four floors including the rooftop terrace, library / research of the 3rd level, second floor still being worked on though you get to ""go behind the scenes"", and the wonderful John C. Calamos, Sr. Great Hall with lots of young, middle school, and high school age activities to test, learn, read, and understand Greek history. Wonderful place at a fair price.

"Smart, clever, innovative, Second City-like theater experience",RossF1234,"It's unlike anything out there, it has a Second City feel, but it's intentionally less polished. It's messy, frenzied, and lots and lots of fun.",Neo-Futurists,January 2016,50
An incredible view into Lithuanian history and culture,R B,We most recently visited the museum to see their display of the Lithuanian holocaust when many Lithuanian citizens were shipped off to gulags in Russia.    What an incredible collection and documentary -- things I never learned in school (not surprising).   Beyond this special exhibit the museum is packed with other treasures that any museum afficiando would love - including a research department.     I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Balzekas while there ... what a consumate gentleman with an ardent desire for all to understand the Lithuanian history and culture.   It is certainly worth the trip !,Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture,February 2012,50
Visually Apealing,ECJoe,We stopped by after dinner to watch the show.  We were watching from Wacker at Wells.  The show was nicely done and you could listen to the accompanying music via a website.

It is really interesting, and I did read a little about how it is done. Very impressive use of a building; and a very accessible way to view art. The show and the artists change from time to time. This particular show included several well know pieces from the Art Institute that were highly recognizable. I highly recommend this experience.",Art on theMART,September 2019,40
Merchandise Mart Gets Artsy,Susan P,"A very interesting concept in showcasing artists conceptual art for the public. Short displays of 'stories' are run on the façade of the Merchandise Mart. Best views are right across the river on the Riverwalk, between Wells and Orleans Streets, where you can sit for the 45 minute or so presentation. Projections begin approximately 30 minutes after sunset, and run every day through September and then will go to 5 nights a week till November or December. It is a lovely way to wind up your day. Accompanying music and narration is streamed, which is clearly indicated on a banner on the Mart. My only wish is that rather than streaming, the music and narration was broadcast audibly.",Art on theMART,September 2019,50
Amazing display of art and music,Susan F,This needs more publicity!! We stumbled across it on a drizzly Chicago evening and were enthralled enough to stand in the rain and watch the art materialize.

Where the SS Eastland capsized in 1915,Taylor B,"The Clark Street Bridge is a bascule bridge that spans the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, connecting the Near North Side with the Loop. The crossing has been in use for more than 170 years. The first bridge at the Clark Street crossing was a floating bridge built in 1840. Construction of the current bridge in 1929 marked the end of the swing bridge era on the Main Branch of the Chicago River. What is a bascule bridge? Also referred to as a drawbridge, it is a moveable bridge with a counterweight that continuously balances a span throughout its upward swing to provide clearance for boat traffic. This is the eighth bridge to span the river at this point. One was struck by a steamer and collapsed. One was destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire. On July 24, 1915, the SS Eastland was scheduled to sail from the dock at the Clark Street Bridge when it capsized. The bridge is 346 feet long and 215 feet wide with a clearance below of 20 feet.",Clark Street Bridge,May 2019,50

We try and go every year to support Chicago and the Industry. Venue laid out very well and lots of room to dance and people watch. But that also means lots of walking. There very strict on what you can bring in so make sure to check out there site before you go. The food venders where laid out well but they need more of them to handle all of the people.

Tough to rate a diamond in the rough,SOGChicago,"So tough to rate this place.  99% of what I attend here is stellar, but, WTF???  Great location, great theater/stage, great outdoor area, and it seems like 1/2 the time the place is empty.  I don't get why City Winery on the west side and SPACE in Evanston can host diverse music 5+ nights a week and the BAC cannot?  Have these same artists been asked to perform the night prior or after at the BAC?  It's been that way from the get go.   Last weekend, I was at the Brews Fest, very well attended, security great, entrance great.  When I commented to a worker, ""You need to have this event every month!"" they replied, ""Oh, it's a lot of work!""  I then asked if they were volunteers.  ""No, employees,"" was their response.  Is that it? Too many right brained folks?   Please consider reaching out to City Winery and SPACE to get a clue as to how to run this fabulous venue.  I love this place and it is in my neighborhood.

We did not do a tour of the brewery - just took a look from the windows inside the restaurant.,Baderbrau Brewery & Tap,November 2017,30
"beer yes, food no",sleepster,"I understand the desire to provide food to go with beer. Baderbrau is in the beer business. They appear to have tacked on food to their business model. This is not a bad thing, but is should not detract from your beer business. This place is spacious and looks like a restaurant so it makes sense that people come here to eat. The beer selection was good, but the food selection was limited, overpriced and not good. The place has picnic style seating mimicking the German bier garten so this and the name made me choose the brat. The brat was nothing that I couldn't get off a grocery store shelf. Who with a German name would serve a brat with yellow mustard? It seems that the owners have never been to Europe or been exposed to good examples of what they are serving. If you want to look authentic and serve authentic beer then either jettison the food or get it right.

I’ve tasted everything on the menu and while I like some cocktails more than others, two sips into any of them and my insides are warmed to the right temperature, summer or winter. I will keep coming back regardless of bathroom walks, empty streets or inclement weather. This is a pure Chicago gem and speaks to the entrepreneurial nature this city has been exhibiting since its inception. I’ve also purchased several bottles for at-home consumption and my family always wants a taste hear or there. As long as they don’t move into the lake, I’ll keep coming.

Took the Tour.... lots of fun,paul274Boston,"If you want to see how Whiskey is made in a legal, licensed operation, this is a great start.

Not to worry too much, though- I still found a few things a little less breakable to pack into the car. They've got a little bit of everything here- clothes, jewelry, decor, furniture. It's a lot to go through, but in generally great shape and well organized, making it easy to peruse. I could have easily spent much longer here than I did. Definitely on my agenda next time I'm in the area.",Broadway Antique Market,July 2018,50

Massive ,ian_dempster,This is a lovely store on the magnificent mile. Had a look after just arriving. Men's department is superb and do big. Just wish it wasn't on the eigth floor.,Macy's,August 2018,40
Mixed review,Betty O,I usually only write a review if I score a 5 or a 1. But today I went to men’s department and a very poor service. I tried using a coupon and I went through 3 people and they wound not let me use it and said a pair of pants I was buying was considered activewear. Then I guess that is what they say so they don’t have to give discount. I was ready to cut up my card. Then I went to the women’s section and had such a nice and helpful lady. I guess I will give Macy’s one more try. But I think I will start throwing away the coupons they send out because they are just disappointing. ,Macy's,February 2019,30
"Nice store, spotty service",johntpt,"Most Chicago residents and frequent visitors still lament the departure of Marshall Field's. The Macy's stores that replaced them are well stocked but the service always leaves something to be desired, as there never seem to be enough clerks and no one is around to answer your questions.",Macy's,June 2019,40
Online con - tried to make me pay double for a product I'd already paid for,Kirsty R,"Awful, awful service would give -100 stars if I could. I was conned by Macy's today. I placed an order for same day pick up, customer services admitted fault that they misfiled the order under ship-to-store to arrive several days later. They had the item at the store but refused to let me pick it up unless I paid them the full amount again, which I couldn't afford to do. Super shady. 2 hours later customer service had called the store manager (apparently it was at the store manager's discretion whether to let me pick up what I'd already paid for?!) who also refused what shouldn't have even been a question. So they have ruined the special event for which I placed the order, wasted hours of my time, and are guilty of false advertising. It would have been such an easy fix but they just don't value their customers. Do NOT fall for their con if you need something same day!! I doubt I'm the only one they've pulled this with, so stay away!",Macy's,August 2019,10

Best museum for Lithuanian culture,MeBlonde,"It was late in the day and I was in the building for some other business when I noticed the gift shop was open. There was a young woman named Eva who told me I could look around.  I figured it was very close to closing so I quickly looked around the first floor museum and will be back.  I left a donation. There is a reasonable charge to see the museum. Lots of things to look at with costumes and display cases filled with Amber which is a Lithuanian mined stone.  I was told Mr. Balzekas who is in his 90's still comes to his office every day.  The gift shop was very interesting and Eva was delightful explaining the culture.  There were books, jewelry, and gifts that I bought for Christmas gifts. History buffs would certainly enjoy all the exhibits.  I parked on the street in front of the museum.",Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture,December 2016,50
Cultural Day in Chicago,Mama_B1A,"My husband's family is from Lithuania so it was very neat to learn more about this country, my family is also from a region very close by so we all learned a lot! Our children, ages 8 and 11 had a good time as well, we all really enjoy history and culture. The children's part of the museum was amazing, it was decorated like a castle and the children really had a great time exploring everything. The pricing of the museum was not expensive and a fair price, for a few dollars more you can become a member, so we did just that and received a nice Magazine with more information about modern day Lithuania.",Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture,July 2017,40

Free attraction for the whole family,maceyr-maceyr,"This conservatory is free but donation is strongly encouraged.  I was expecting a relatively small greenhouse or similar attraction with some plants but was amazed at how many plants were there.  The conservatory was divided into certain rooms depending on the climate of the plants.  There's a room for ferns, a desert house for cactus family of plants, aroid house, children's garden, palm house.  There are even some koi fishes swimming in the ponds.  If you are a lover of plants, you will love  this place.  Even those who aren't into plants will find it quite enjoyable.  During the summer months, there will be other gardens outside.  Looking forward to revisiting this place in the summer.",Garfield Park Conservatory,December 2018,50

I was able to get tickets for the 11:30am game on January 20th almost last minute on Stub Hub. We took a Lyft to United Center and they dropped us off in front of gate 3. Once inside I was amazed at all the concessions available and the seating was just as close. You have not lived til you experienced the National Anthem done by Jim Cornelison and the roar of the crowd. This was on my bucket list. BTW the 'Hawks handed it to the Capitols and it was an overall great time.

"Don't miss the ""Paradise under Glass"" on Chicago's lakefront",Taylor B,"We never cease to be thankful for the fact that we live near North Avenue and North Dearborn Parkway, overlooking North Avenue Beach and Lincoln Park. Nearly every day, especially in warm weather, my wife and I take long walks along the lakefront and through the park, to Lincoln Park Zoo and Lincoln Park Conservatory. The Conservatory and botanical garden is a wonder to behold. Located at 2391 North Stockton Drive, south of Fullerton Avenue, west of North Lake Shore Drive and adjacent to Lincoln Park Zoo, Lincoln Park Conservatory provides significant horticultural collections, educational programs and community outreach efforts. It is a Victorian Era glass house, built in 1893, containing four rooms displaying exotic plants from around the world. Rare orchids, like the Moth orchid, can be found in the Orchid Room. A formal garden is situated in front of the Conservatory, one of the oldest public gardens in Chicago, designed and planted in the late 1870s. It has been the home of many sculptors and works of art, the most famous being the Bates fountains, the Schiller monument and the Shakespeare monument. The Conservatory was established in a small greenhouse in 1877 but city leaders decided to build a new and more substantial conservatory. Between 1890 and 1895, architects Joseph Lyman Silsbee and Mifflin E. Bell designed and built an exotic-style glass conservatory which was described as ""a paradise under glass."" The conservatory consists of a vestibule, four display halls and 15 propagating and growing houses. The vestibule and Palm House were built and opened to the public in 1892 and contain giant palms and rubber trees, including a 50-foot fiddle-leaf rubber tree planted in 1891. The most unusual palms include Dwarf Sugar, Bottle Fiji Fan and Everglade. The Palm House also includes plants that produce food: banana plants, a grapefruit tree, orange trees, papaya plants, a coffee tree and a cacao tree. The Orchid Room has a collection of approximately 25,000 natural species, including hundreds of orchids, bromeliads and a few tropical carnivorous plants. The Fern Room, opened in 1895, contains plants of the forest floor, primarily a vast collection of ferns and one of the most historical plants, the cycads, fossils of which date back at least 250 million years. Two attractions associated with the Lincoln Park Conservatory, the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pond and the North Pond Nature Sanctuary, are located north of the conservatory along Stockton Avenue, across Fullerton Avenue.",Lincoln Park Conservatory,November 2018,50
Don't miss the Conservatory!,Simple38,"We arrived at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon and were able to locate free parking on the street without a problem. It was a short walk to the conservatory. There is no entrance free, however when you enter there is a donation box. This is a good place to go for an hour or two on average during a cold day when the weather is not being cooperative. There is a Christmas themed display with a few moving trains set up that run around and through it. The staff was friendly and helpful. This was not my first visit here, and won't be my last. There are a few places with benches along the path where you can rest if needed. Condensation sometimes drips from the plants or roof, bring a hat if you think it will bother you or if you wear glasses. A lightweight water resistant jacket could be useful, but you would be ok without them.",Lincoln Park Conservatory,November 2018,50

Airport layover ,madtat,"peperoncini, lettuce & tomato on focaccia bread with chips & a pickle.  The bartender got defensive again.  “It’s not hot. Someone ordered it earlier and complained it wasn’t warm.”  I said “Hot means spicy. It’s a spicy Italian sandwich.  I know I’m Italian. Can you just bring it to me?”  “The bartender smiled and said “0h . . . . Ok.” But she didn’t bring me my sandwich right away even though it was right there in the fridge.  She started setting up another round of drinks for her customers that were at the bar before I arrived.  As I looked around I realized no one was eating.  The average age in the bar was twenty something (barely) and they were there to drink.  One young woman at the bar was loud and obnoxious.  90 minutes later this over served individual would show up on my plane loudly announcing I was in her seat.  I wasn’t.  It took myself and another woman to convince this intoxicated millennial to sit down in the seat that matched the crumbled boarding pass in her hand.  Five minutes in the air she was unconscious and thankfully so.  Back to the bar and I have to ask the bartender “are you going to give me that sandwich?”  She looks confused, has a moment of clarity and goes right to the fridge to retrieve my sandwich.  The sandwich was really good. Amazing for an airport.  Good sandwich & a tall flavorful beer. It wasn’t easy but the end result was good.  ",Goose Island Beer Co.,September 2018,40

An interesting collection of writers with some surprising choices,deborahbC3444RB,This is a small museum but you can easily spend a couple of hours as we spent over 2 hours here. The timeline was an interesting interactive display and the children’s area contained some much loved reminders. Didn’t notice a great deal on some such as Arthur Miller but certainly a wide range. The Bob Dylan exhibit was well set up with music stations etc.  We were disappointed with the offerings at the gift shop as like others who were there we looked for some of the books etc to buy. Nothing much in the way of posters or drawings from the celebrated authors. Hopefully that will come.,American Writers Museum,December 2018,40
Small and delightful,Janice R,"This was our first time here.  The museum is small.  At this time there were two special exhibits, one on Frederick Douglass and one on Bob Dylan.  The Douglass exhibit would be interesting for anyone who follows his life and writing ...  pictures and excerpts from his writing and speeches.  The Dylan exhibit forcuses on his Highway 61 Revisited album.  His stratocaster guitar played at the famous 1965 Newport Folk Festival is on display.  This exhibit is extremely interactive -- lots of chances to hear his music played by other muscians.  We really enjoyed the visit.  However, the museum is so small that once you see the special exhibits, together with the two or three permanent exhibits, there isn't any reason to revisit until there is some new special exhibit.  There's a small ""gift"" wall and free bookmarks!  We would recommend that everyone visit, especially is you love folk music and Bob Dylan.",American Writers Museum,December 2018,50

"Amazingly modern look, artistic treasure",John G,"Hard to believe that this Frank Lloyd Wright designed home was almost demolished and at one point was a dorm!  This is an architetural treasurer.  Built when the prairie was close and most homes were historically Victorian styles, this must have stood out.  Many of the elements of classic FLW style are here - horizontal emphasis, deep overhangs, total design of interiors, use of local materials, etc.  I'm giving this 5 stars because it is a classic architectural treasure that you can visit and explore.  Practical matters:  while there is much to see from the sidewalk, buy the one hour tour.  Expect parts of the house to be under reconstruction.  They have been restoring for 15 years.  Look at the window details, the built ins, trim, etc.    It is amazing how modern a 100 year old house looks today.  Bravo for the folks who thought to preserve the building.

The marble and wood and glass make this building beautiful and unique. A great place to visit - a hidden gem. ",The Rookery Building,August 2018,50
Gorgeous architecture!,HMKaren,"My husband and I saw the Rookery as part of a walking tour presented by the Chicago Architecture Foundation (90 minutes for about $25, I think). You only see the lobby, but believe me, that is plenty. Stunning! The staircases and lighting were amazing. If architecture is of any interest to you I think you'll love it.",The Rookery Building,June 2018,50
Lovely,Familytraveller31,"I finally took a tour of the Rookery from the Frank Lloyd Wright trust, and it was terrific.  I already knew a lot about Burnham & Root and the Rookery, but I was still fascinated.  Sigh up for the tour online and go.",The Rookery Building,June 2018,50
Totally worth a quick visit ,sarahmO5452KB,"We walked in on our own, not with a tour, so couldn’t go far (couldn’t go up the stairs). The building is so beautiful that it is worth it just to see it from the inside. The gold everywhere is stunning, as is the ceiling. We will probably only inside for 15 minutes, but I am very glad we went. It is quite close to the Sears Tower, so if you are headed that way, you can easily add a stop at this beautiful building.",The Rookery Building,August 2018,50
Best dog park in Chicago,Yuanyuan W,"Wonderful place! finally we find a nice place for our dogs! The equipment inside is awesome for dog training and socializing!  We should know that dogs are our family members, and they DO NOT want to be leashed all the time.  They want to play freely and safely.  Jackson Bark provides all my dog and I want.  We have great time together with other pup families.  I hope more and more families can join us!",Jackson Bark - Dog Park,April 2015,50
An Historic Park Named for an Historic Mayor,MaryinChicago,"This lovely park is a welcome green space on the Magnificent Mile.  A person can relax on a bench before continuing to shop or visit the city.  The Water Tower located on it adds a special reminder of Chicago's history.  What an honor to the memory of Jane Byrne, Chicago's first female mayor.  I remember seeing Jane Byrne in a department store talking to two young women who were sales staff.  After Jane Byrne left, I asked the women if they knew who she was.  They did not recognize her.  Thank you to all concerned for leaving a reminder in such an historic place of a woman who bravely stepped into the tough Chicago political arena.",Jane Byrne Park,June 2018,50

Serene park with great views of the Chicago skyline,catchat105,"This park was once a landfill, though you wouldn't be able to tell with the way the land was rehabilitated.  From street level, it is a bit of a climb to the summit, but once you get up there, you're treated to amazing views of the city skyline.  The park also shows signs of its history as a rock quarry before being used as a landfill.  It's pretty cool to see its history reflected in the current setting.",Palmisano Park,July 2017,40
Beautiful ,JodieH1984,"This is a beautiful beach on Lake Michegan (which is that big it looks more like an ocean). Nice little beach bar, golden sand, wifi! Loved it! Great way to spend a day on a not too crowded beach. Worth the train ride out of town ",Kathy Osterman Beach,July 2016,50
beautiful church,ELKW,"The church is very beautiful esp. when you looking at those pictures you took, because there is enough light, so you can take many beautiful pictures, and see the true beauty of the church, The decoration of the church and pretty and elegant.It's one of the idea sites for wedding","St, Mary of Perpetual Help Roman catholic church",October 2017,40

Fantastic and unassuming,kelpiek,"I visited Our Lady of Sorrows on Open House Chicago. It was the first site we visited that day and I am glad we did because I never would have known about this site otherwise. The exterior of the basilica is relatively unassuming-it is even missing a tower, however it really is a sight from the inside! If you will be in the area or at all interested in churches, definitely worth a visit.",Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica,October 2011,50
Small neighborhood theatre,mariloud397,We went to see the Games of Thrones parody. Plenty of tickets on the day of the show.  It's a small theatre so I think all seats are good.  You won't have a problem seeing the stage.  There is really no parking space except for a few areas under the el ($15 cash) right near the entrance.  We were running late so we didn't want to drive around looking for a spot.  There is a small concession stand but we opted to walk to Halsted to grab something to eat afterwards. Overall it was ok.,Apollo Theater Chicago,August 2016,30
Historic Pullman Tour October - loved it!,pttraveller45,"Worth it if you love architecture, woodworking, interior design. So many people had Autumn decorations out and lots of flowers. I took water, but the church there has some food/drink available also. Highly recommend it. The visitor center itself - nice, had restrooms and friendly staff. Hit the tour though if you want the true experience.",Pullman National Monument Information Center,October 2011,50
"Pullman Villiage, Rich with History",ok12345,"Andy and Dee gave us a welcoming and informative tour of the grounds of the Pullman Factory. It  was such a rich and interesting tour given by people who live in the community. Andy touched on many  aspects of the history of Pullman Factory: the construction of the factory, labor issues, manufacturing, Pullmans' own work history and family. What a fascinating piece of American History! I kept thinking about it days after leaving and only wish scads of money could be poured into the Visitor Center and grounds because it deserves to be preserved for future generations so they can learn thru walking about the neighborhood and grounds of Pullman to see this man's vision and failures and how a piece of this is now reflected in our working culture and history.",Pullman National Monument Information Center,July 2013,40

First rate!,tomparff,"Saw their production of The Killer Angels;  OUTSTANDING from top to bottom!  We'll start with the support staff.  My wife uses a wheel chair and from making special parking available to the theater manager (A delightful young lady named ""Mo"") giving us a heads up as to how we should position the chair to see the actors as they move about the stage, every one at the theater was a joy to work with.  And then the actors who put on this production!  Many of them playing multiple  parts; the talent level at this play was extremely high.  And the special effects!  If you love theater, this is the place to be!",Lifeline Theatre,September 2013,50
Great little theater,chubbywillie55,"My wife and I were just there to see a Tale of Two Cities. Excellent performance by all actors involved, try to make this show before it ends. Easy to miss this theater since it is down the alley but very unique inside. The narrow theater has about 100 seats and all have a good view. We loved our experience here and would go back for another show.",Lifeline Theatre,March 2014,50
Very educational statue located in the spectacular spot,O6378WFannag,"Haym Salomon was born in Leszno, Poland, in 1740. His parents had been driven out of what is now Portugal by anti-Semitic laws decreed by the monarchy. He traveled throughout Europe in the 1760’s and became fluent in several languages. He returned to Poland in 1770, but had to flee again in 1772 because he was involved in Poland’s nationalism effort (Poland was at that time invaded by its neighbours: Germany, Russia & Prussia).Salomon immigrated than to New York City in 1775 and became a financial broker. He sympathized with the anti-British forces and joined the Sons of Liberty. The British arrested him for spying in 1776 and again in 1778. He then moved to Philadelphia and resumed his brokerage business.  Unfortunately, Salomon died penniless shortly after the Revolutionary War, having donated everything he owned to the war effort. The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in 1975 hailing Salomon as a “Financial Hero of the American Revolution.”",Heald Square Monument,June 2016,50
Highly Recommend,MillerONC,"An inspiring worship service that includes traditional hymns, beautiful music and a faithful exposition of Scripture.  Staff and members are friendly and helpful.

Beautiful Facilities; Great History; Awesome Future ,Billy M,Across the street from the Chicago History Museum is another piece of history of Chicago and the Christian faith...the D. L.

We walked in as strangers and left as friends...thankful for connecting us to Rosetta who gave us a great tour and shared about the ministries of the church. We serve an Awesome God!,The Moody Church,December 2015,50
Wonderful Worship,Trista D,"This is a wonderful church!  A person really feels welcome and cared for here.

Highly recommended,Amelia S,"I can't recommend this theater enough. I saw The Invisible Man there a few weeks ago. What a production! Everything was great - the scenic design, the lighting, the choreography, the acting, everything. They offer discounts for students and children, so feel free to inquire. ",Court Theater,January 2012,50
Great show!,eschip,"We really enjoyed this show!  The performers were excellent.  My only very small complaint is that some of them did not speak loudly enough during the speaking parts.  It might have been our seats, because the other couple we were with saw the show previously and they said that was not a problem on that show.  But overall it was really good and I highly recommend it!!  Make sure you don't leave early...the last 15 minutes are the best!!!!!",Apollo Theater Chicago,September 2015,40

Loved Million Dollar Quartet,PasoWarrior,"My husband and I just loved seeing this production which has been running for 7 years. The theater has 400 seats and the stage is a 3-sided thrust. Not a bad seat in the house. If I were to do it again, I would probably not purchase tickets in advance unless you're going on the weekend as you pay a real premium. One of the actors was ill and his understudy took over but I could not find a fault with him or any other performer. I'm a musician and was very impressed with all the performers.",Apollo Theater Chicago,October 2015,50

"Amazing building, excellent architecture",oldblues10,During the week there are free tours of the building. I live nearby so i decided to go in one day.  The building is amazing and reminds me of visits to state capitol buildings because of the ornate architecture and domed ceiling.  The place does not get many visitors which is nice because it creates a very tranquil experience.,Elks National Memorial,May 2013,50

Jaw-dropping beautiful & potent memorial,Chris B,"Inside, ornament takes over; the entire central rotunda is clad in a dazzling variety of marbles,  a soaring coffered dome covers the space.  A ceremonial room off the rotunda, clad in beautiful walnut and gilding, features more murals.  The best artists of the era (~1926) were used to design and decorate in the memorial.

Excellent Performance,Chicagologist,"Went to a Saturday Matinee of Invisible Man, and we were blown away by the power of the performance. My partner was extremely impessed with how easily the performers were able to move from one role to another, and how natural it seemed.  The venue itself did not have a bad seat, we were concerned about sitting in the back row, and it wasnt at all a problem, everything could be seen and heard perfectly.",Court Theater,February 2012,40

Awesome church with great history,tomwatson84,"If you are a follower in Christ and love American church history you HAVE TO visit this place. Attend a Sunday morning church, after the service you can visit the visitor centre (where they have refreshments and you can meet the minister) and then go on a tour of the church and hear about the history. It's fascinating- D.L. Moody was a very interesting man and one who reflected Christ in the way he lived. The guy who gave our tour (I think Patrick) knew his history so well! Lovely bloke ",The Moody Church,December 2012,50
Trip to Chicago,psalm73a,I found the church to be open and friendly. The service was meaningful and relevant today's issues. I enjoyed Pastor's Reception and the tour that followed. I was able to stand in Dr. Lutzer's pulpit. It was awesome.,The Moody Church,April 2013,50
Great Historical Place to Go to Church,littleindo,We enjoyed the service so much and stayed for the tour afterwards.  Awesome place!!  The pews were the old fashioned theatre seats.  The greeter was very helpful in finding us a seat.  The music was excellent.  Must go!,The Moody Church,May 2013,50

Two Ratings?,ChickPicker,Theater--lobby area in dire need of new carpet or flooring that doesn't smell like a wet dog.

One of the very best theaters in Chicago,jonno22,"I've been a subscriber to the Goodman, the ATC, Victory Gardens, and Court over the past 10+ years.  I've also seen shows at the Lookingglass, Steppenwolf, and many others.  Now I just subscribe to the Court and pick and choose at the others.  There is no other theatre that gives such consistent high quality productions.  I have very rarely walked away unsatisfied.  They work with some of the best actors and directors, they make excellent, ambitious choices for their seasons, and they understand that classics include a diverse pool of playwrights.  I always look forward to going to the Court.  ",Court Theater,May 2012,50
great hospitality,pjrwalsh,"The Court Theater has hit or miss plays.  This one--James Joyce's The Dead--was a miss.  But An Iliad was amazing.  What is always consistent is their hospitality.  From greeting to exit surveys, they want to accommodate their patrons.",Court Theater,November 2012,50

The sculptural frieze to the south is the Triumphs of Peace, to the north is the Triumphs of War, both by A.A.Weinman, of Washington D.C. sculptural fame and many state capitols. The two Elks are by Laura Gerdin Fraser. The inside easily overwhelms with some 27 types of marble, an acoustically perfect dome, and murals all around by Eugene Savage and Edwin Blashfield.

Fun for the kids too,MSjanni,"Decided to stop by after Lincoln Park zoo trip. Free/donations in afternoons.  The reception room has 2 massive oak tables we were told weigh 1,000 pounds each.  They were pushed together to create a dining room scene for the movie Richie Rich which started Macaulay Culkin.  The adjoining domed room was built for acoustics and everyone should take a turn leaning over the round table and talking-big hit with the kids!  Very beautiful and a nice break from the business of the city. ",Elks National Memorial,July 2016,50
Splendid,Joanne O,This splendid building can pass you by. Wonderful exterior guarded by two fantastic bronze elks and inside is a vision to behold!

Stunning is just a mild compliment to this magnificent marble and gold tribute, originally for World War I Elk member veterans.

"Under Construction and Under The ""L""",Piquarick,"We recently attended The Million Dollar Quartet at The Apollo Theater and had a great time...the show was a rockin' good time and there are no bad seats. I will say that we had some trouble finding the theater even in a cab. The theater seems to be under construction as well as under the ""L"" So several times the performance was nearly drowned-out by the rumble of passing trains...a more subtle performance would have been totally over-ridden by the noise.

A lesser known gem,Muckwa_Bear,"During its heyday, this church was really popular, which is why it was elevated to basilica status. Today, it seems like it is less well known and visited. The artwork is beautiful: the Carrara marble altar, the murals, the Volto Santo replica, the tilework on the ceiling, and the balconies near the apse.

Don't wait like I did - Court Theater does not disappoint!",Court Theater,February 2014,50
Always outstanding,jdkegel,The Court Theater was a highlight of living in the Hyde Park neighborhood while in graduate school thirty years ago. I have gone back through the years and went again last night to see M. Butterfly. The cast was superb and the intimacy of the theater always a delight. The University of Chicago gives an academic vibe and the audience is a good mix of older (what theater isn't mostly older these dats) and students. It is rather a hidden gem on the south side but well worth the trip.,Court Theater,May 2014,50
Well worth the money,Clemente71,"I have seen a couple of musicals here including folk opera Porgy and Bess. In each case I thought the performances were excellent.

Big Show in a Tiny Theater,Jeanne M,"The theater itself has incovenient parking ($12) or at the meters $2/hour. The lobby is cramped and looks a bit dicey.

There are no bad seats.  The low slop design of the audience seating provides everyone with a clear view and good sound from the stage.  I saw Iphigenia in Aulis, on of three plays by Euripides that the Court will offer as a trilogy over the next year.  The play was translated by Nicholas Rudall and directed by Charles Newell. They preserved the urgency in Agamemnon's dilemma over his promise to sacrifice his virgin daughter to Artemis so that the Greek army could sail to Troy and free compromised Helen. The production was simple, elegant and powerful.  Use of language and intent of the play married completely.  All of the cast were convincing in their roles.  The stage direction was excellent.  The use of minimal props that nonetheless evoked ancient Greece was masterful.  This theater is hard to access, but the quality of the production is worth the effort.  I had a bad bistro sandwich at the art museum next store beforehand, but I recommend you stop in Hyde Park and eat elsewhere.",Court Theater,December 2014,50
Great theater & Hyde Park too,zadkine,"They offer a unique service: Give them your name at the box-office and they'll have a taxi waiting when you leave the theater. It's about 20 minutes to Hyde Park. Next time we're in Chicago, we'll do it again.",Court Theater,March 2015,50

Great use of a city landmark,gmazeman,"The Chicago Water Tower, at the corner of Chicago Ave. and Michigan Ave, is one of the most distinctive enchanting buildings in the world.

What a sacred place to greet visitors to this fair city.",Chicago Waterworks Visitors Center,September 2013,50

CHICAGO THEATER IS NOT CHICAGO OPERA THEATER,David R,"This listing is a merging of two institutions that have nothing to do with each other. The Chicago Theater -- which is the subject of the photo attached here -- is a commercial venue for comedy and music acts.  Chicago Opera Theater (COT) is a small opera company that does about 3 productions a year at the Harris Theater, which is on the edge of Millennium Park.  I think it would be fair to say that COT does chamber opera: smaller operas with scaled down production values, emerging singers, and smaller orchestras. They do it very well.  COT does unusual works rather than the tired warhorses that the major opera houses do. The ticket prices are far lower than the big boys, and musically, the productions are always first-rate.  I highly recommend COT for the serious opera fan.",Chicago Opera Theater,April 2012,50
Wonderful rendition of The Magic Flute...,bjeanp,What more could one ask?,Chicago Opera Theater,September 2012,50
the cutting edge opera house,mja1982,I'm a season subscriber to both the COT and Lyric - and like both for different reasons.  At the Lyric you get to see one of the world's great opera companies; at the COT you get to see a company that isn't afraid to take risks.  I've seen an opera performed by robots and sparse (but beautiful) renditions of old favorites.  The Harris Theater is very nice and it hardly seems like there is a bad seat in the house.  The COT makes tickets affordable and your only steps off of Michigan Avenue.  I highly suggest that opera lovers get to the COT as quickly as possible to make sure that they continue putting on wonderful presentations.,Chicago Opera Theater,February 2013,50

Amazing space - plan ahead if mobility-challenged,Becky L,"A friend and I just saw the incredible Million Dollar Quartet at this great theatre. We were lucky enough to get front row seats for the amazing show. The thrust stage put the actors almost within arms' reach, and the cozy setting made this show amazing!!! I cannot imagine seeing it anywhere but here. Great actors, light, sound, etc. Courteous staff - very helpful and knowledgeable. While they do have an outdoor ""elevator"" to help people with mobility issues, they need to be informed that you will need some assistance. Either have a member of your party go up the stairs to let them know or call them from your cell when you get there. The ""elevator"" is about 10 feet behind the main entrance on the street. We got front row seats, but they required going up one very big step that did not have a hand rail. That was a little scary. They did have some seating that did not require going up a step. This theater is located about 20 minutes or so from downtown. Plan accordingly for traffic (we had very little as it was a Sunday evening). It took us a little while to get a cab to return to the city as well. Did not seem to have many restaurants that interested us in the area, so we ate downtown before we left. There are, however, some restaurants near the theatre (sushi one right next door). Highly recommend seeing Million Dollar Quartet here!! You won't regret it...only thing that would have made our night better would  have been getting the scarf that Elvis gave away at the end of the show...",Apollo Theater Chicago,July 2013,50

Just go!!!,Dellcomm3,This church is absolutely beautiful and they still do a Latin Mass at 8:30 on Sundays.  It’s really beautiful.  It’s great to take children to so they can see how the Mass used to be.  Their English mass has some old school too.  It’s a great parish with friendly welcoming kind Priests and congregation.  It’s not stuffy at all so if you want to check out the Latin mass don’t be afraid just sit in the back and follow along.  Wide age range of parishioners.

"Go See ""Million Dollar Quartet""",Firsthope,"Hadn't been to Apollo Theater in a long time.  While I love its quaint and intimate setting, and the ability to purchase drinks AND take them into the theatre, I'm not so thrilled with the many stairs and back-of-house access to ladies room which is down a tiny spiral staircase!  Most seating is excellent for viewing productions.  Last row, off right did make some cast members hard to hear if they were speaking in another direction.  Million Dollar Quartet was fantastic!

Did you notice the seated Statue of Liberty on the back side?,Taylor B,"The Heald Square Monument became the first sculpture designated as a Chicago Landmark by the Chicago City Council on September 15, 1971. So why are so few people aware of it? Located at the intersection of East Wacker Drive and Wabash Avenue, across the Chicago River from the Trump Tower, the 11-foot-tall bronze sculpture by Lorado Taft depicts General George Washington and the two principal financiers of the American Revolution, Robert Morris and Haym Salomon. Following Taft's death in 1936, the sculpture was completed by his associates, Leonard Crunelle, Nellie Walker and Mary Webster. Heald Square was named for Captain Nathan Heald, commander of Fort Dearborn from 1810-1812. An interesting footnote to the sculpture is the little known bronze plaque on the back side of the granite base, showing a seated Statue of Liberty. In this depiction, Lady Liberty is stretching out her arms to welcome all persons of whatever race and belief. In all honesty, I wasn't even aware of the significance of the sculpture until I was informed recently by a friend who serves as a tour guide for historic sites in Chicago. Several years ago, for a 50th anniversary story, I directed a Chicago Sun-Times photographer to take a picture of members of Mount Carmel High School's 1950 football team with the sculpture as a backdrop. Little did I know at the time. The sculpture was the idea of Barnet Hodes, a Chicago attorney, who led an attempt to curb the rise of Anti-Semitism in Chicago when he created the Patriotic Foundation of Chicago in 1936. Of Polish Jewish heritage, Hodes had read about the financial contributions that Jewish patriot Haym Salomon had made to the American Revolution and planned to honor him. But he felt that a commemorative statue of Salomon standing alone would not deliver the message of inter-cultural cooperation as effectively as a sculpture with non-Jewish patriots like George Washington and Robert Morris. The sculpture was dedicated on December 15, 1941, on the 150th anniversary of the adoption of the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and eight days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.",Heald Square Monument,May 2019,50

Must go if you are in Lincoln Park or going to the Lincoln Park Zoo!,michaelbZ9883TL, The Elks Memorial is without question one of the most beautiful buildings in all of Chicago!!,Elks National Memorial,September 2018,50
"Inside or outside, it is a magnificent architectural masterpiece",Taylor B,"I don't know how many times I walked past the Elks National Veterans Memorial on my way to and from my doctor's office over the years. But, for whatever reason, I recently noticed an article about an event being conducted at the building and, out of sheer curiosity, I decided to stop in and take advantage of the free admission after my most recent visit to the doctor. My father was an Elk. In fact, at one time, he was the leader of the Blue Island Elks Lodge. I was initiated into the Elks but, unfortunately, I didn't keep up  my membership. I recall him talking about the Elks Memorial on more than a few occasions. It was time for me to get acquainted. What a magnificent building. Located at 2750 North Lakeview Avenue, at Diversey, across from Lincoln Park, it is a Beaux Arts-style domed structure that was planned by the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks who wished to honor members of their order who had served in World War I. It was constructed from 1924 to 1926 and rededicated in 1946, 1976 and 1994 to honor veterans of World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and all subsequent conflicts. In 2003, it was granted memorial landmark status by the city of Chicago. Fine marble was imported from Greece, Austria, France, Belgium and Italy as well as from Vermont, Tennessee, Alabama and Missouri. High quality limestone came from Indiana. The building's lavish construction and interior decoration and artwork have cause it to be described as ""one of the most magnificent war memorials in the world."" It features sculptures by Adolph A. Weinman, Laura Gardin Fraser and James Earle Fraser and murals by Eugene Savage and Edwin Blashfield. The beauty and grandeur of the rotunda defies description with its murals and statues depicting the Elks' four cardinal virtues: charity, justice, brotherly love and fidelity. The friezes portray the ""Triumphs of War"" on one said and ""Triumphs of Peace"" on the other. The entrance is flanked by two large bronze sculptures of elks. Besides its status as a memorial, the building also serves as the national headquarters of the Elks.",Elks National Memorial,November 2018,50

Sound system is WAAAY too loud!!,AlanKWi,"I like loud music.  But the sound at the Million Dollar Quartet show was ear splitting and uncomfortable.  Which is too bad since the actors are very talented and it was otherwise a good show.  The sound level however degraded rather than enhanced the sound.  The sound engineer reminded me of a trumpet player that does not know the difference between a loud sound and an overblown BLAAT.  Also, the theater is nice but if you are tall get an aisle seat since there is little leg room.",Apollo Theater Chicago,March 2011,20
Interesting,S8674RWsusanm,"One of the newest national park sites is interesting. I actually rode in the Empire Builder to Whitefish, Montana. It was a rockin-n-arollin. So I was fascinated by the accomplishments of George Pullman.",Pullman National Monument Information Center,June 2017,40
Emerging Foundation has new visitor center,hearingsaver,"The Center tells the story of George Pullman, who revolutionized train travel by introducing a comfortable “palace car.” He developed the town of Pullman, the nation's first industrial planned community. It helped establish the American labor movement, and usher in the era of civil rights. The Center should be your first stop on a walking tour of the historic district. It offers an informative video, and a self tour guide. (Park rangers and volunteers are available for guided tours on a limited basis.) You'll see the distinctive Pullman rowhouses that housed workers, and were comfortable by standards of the day. They offered amenities not common for the time: indoor plumbing, gas, and sewers. After your visit, consider a companion visit to the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum - for the rest of the story. Don't miss walking around the neighborhood to see the church, school, and Florence Hotel.",Pullman National Monument Information Center,March 2018,40
Joint National Park Service - Visitor Center,DiAlJo,We visited this because of the National Park Service - Junior Ranger Program.  What we found was a rich history of the entire Pullman experience.

In area and stopped in. Amazing,766stever,The very idea and history of what george Pullman did is amazing and important.   So I was hoping to go inside all the buildings.

From the tiny Catholic Church of Mission San Xavier del Bac, Tucson, Arizona to the Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires, Argentina , where I shook hands after Easter Mass with the then Cardinal of Buenos Aires , now known as Pope Francis.  I love Church architecture. It all started with the beautiful Basilica on the west side of Chicago. I went back there in October , 2015 to attend a mass.  Naturally , memories came flooding back.

Always dependable; often soaring!,gayhayward,"Don't think that ""Classical Theater"" means all Greek, Roman or Shakespeare.  Court does a mix each season.  For example, their recent version of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was a wonderful adaptation of the movie, with just enough ""updating"" to keep it relevant without losing it's period piece vibe.  Court did mount a three-year ""Iphiginea Cycle"" project in '15, '16 and '17 which was beautifully cast and got rave reviews (though Greek tragedy is not really my cup o' tea.)  In recent years, they have done all 10 August Wilson American Decades, with great casting and direction.  It's because of this wonderful variety and quality that I subscribe every year!

I cannot imagine how long it took to buildit.   It was so so beautiful. Every seat in this place is perfect.  The seats could use a bit more padding as sitting in them for 2+ hrs was not comfortable. The ushers were very helpful and professionals.   I also found it odd that there was a lot of security at the door searching bags etc and then the gentleman sitting beside us was so drunk he could barely even walk.

Yesterday, I was surprised to see a huge tent had been erected on the grounds in preparation for a special event. (No one seemed to know what was happening.) Even though the tent took up most of the grassy area, people were still using the track for jogging and walking.  On the east end of the park is a small playground which young children always seem to enjoy and on the opposite end are tennis courts. I've seen people playing soccer while others have spread a blanket to relax. There are a few tables where I've seen people studying, having a picnic, or enjoying a bottle of wine with friends.

See the Chicago Cubs' columbarium,Taylor B,"Bohemian National Cemetery isn't as celebrated as Graceland or Arlington or Hollywood or Forest Lawn or other notable cemeteries my wife and I have visited in our travels from coast to coast. But it is noteworthy for some of its features. Consequently, it's worth a visit. Located at 5255 North Pulaski Road on Chicago's North Side, it was built in 1877 by members of Chicago's Czechoslovakian community after a Czech Catholic woman was denied burial at several Catholic cemeteries in Chicago. It is best known for its limestone gatehouse and its highly decorated columbarium niches, which contain photographs, artwork, flags and other mementos of the individuals whose ashes are stored there, including Czech-American military veterans from the American Civil War, Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II. Notable interments include victims of the USS Eastland disaster in 1915 and Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, who was assassinated in 1933. But many visitors come to see the Chicago Cubs columbarium, a replica of Wrigley Field's red brick wall with a stained glass image of the stadium's scoreboard and a yellow 400-foot marker. The wall of the structure, which was added in 2006, contains 288 niches and seats from Wrigley Field have been placed along its base. Why is it there? Because a Cubs fan named Dennis Mascari raised funds for the project in hopes of making visits to the cemetery less depressing. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.",Bohemian National Cemetery,November 2019,50

It is a box,O6378WFannag,I had to come here to see this exclaimed   modern masterpiece by Mies van der Rohe. And you can easily see here “less is more”.

Mies van der Rohe hall at IIT ,dvkremk,We took the Chicago Architectural tour of the IIT campus and visited Crown Hall as part of the tour.   It was a well constructed building.  When we were there they had a Lego event.  ,S.R. Crown Hall,July 2018,40
One of Mies van der Rohe's architectural masterpieces,Taylor B,"Completed in 1956, the S.R. Crown Hall houses the College of Architecture at Illinois Institute of Technology on Chicago's South Side. Located at 3360 South State Street, it was designed by German-American Modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and is regarded as one of his architectural masterpieces, famous for its simplicity and transparency. Considered one of the most architecturally significant buildings of the 20th century Modernist movement, Crown Hall is all about basic steel and glass construction, staying true to the architect's ""less is more"" style. The two-level building is configured as a pure rectangular form, 220 feet by 120 feet by 18 feet tall. The enclosed space is free of columns with four six-foot steel plate girders welded to eight H-columns. These girders suspend the roof in a single plane to form a primary structure. Crown Hall was designated as a Chicago Landmark i 1997 and added to the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001.",S.R. Crown Hall,August 2019,50

"""Paradise of the people""",Taylor B,"Sometimes I think Chicagoans take the Lakefront for granted. My wife and I have lived on the Chicago Lakefront for 42 years and I often wonder if we taken advantage of it or appreciate it as much as we should. After all, how many people live next to such a beautiful piece of nature as Lake Michigan? I'm not talking about the Chicago Lakefront Trail, the 18-mile-long path for walking, jogging and cycling. I'm talking about the 17-mile-long stretch of public land that belongs to all of us, from South Shore and Jackson Park in the South to Hollywood Drive and Montrose Beach to the North. If you have access to a boat, you can get a magnificent view of the landscape from a mile or two offshore. It is unique in the world, a paradise of the people. You can experience the feeling by driving from south to north along Lake Shore Drive, watching Chicago's skyline grow bigger and bigger...South Shore Country Club, dating to 1916, Jackson Park (designed after New York City's Central Park and dating to 1893), the Museum of Science and Industry, the University of Chicago, Promontory Point, McCormick Place, Soldier Field, Northerly Island, Field Museum, Lake Shore East, Museum Campus, Millennium Park, Navy Pier and the 15-story Ferris wheel, Lake Point Tower, Streeterville, East Lake Shore Drive, Drake Hotel, Oak Street Beach, the Gold Coast, North Avenue Beach, Lincoln Park, Montrose Beach.

Great Museum in Portage Park,Awilda0216,"The National Veterans Museum was unknown to me less than a week ago.  But I'm so glad I learned of it.  It's a small, 1 floor museum in Portage Park showcases an important part of American history.  The art and artifacts increased my understanding of this war and the impact it's had on our veterans.  When I attended there was a exhibit on the art of one of my favorite authors, Kurt Vonnegut.  I knew Vonnegut was a veteran, but was unaware he was an artist.  The museum is donation-only, and I wish I had brought more cash to contribute.  We spent around 90 minutes there and it was time very well spent.",National Veterans Art Museum,February 2017,50
Very nice Vietnam exhibit,VinMar_10,"A great place to stop just before Memorial Day.  Being a Vietnam veteran, I enjoyed seeing items the were used by us vets in Vietnam.

No fee, just donations.",National Veterans Art Museum,May 2018,40

"Free, worthwhile museum",CityHiker73,"We happened to be visiting a relative nearby, and this museum was recommended to us.  It is on the second floor, so you do have to be alert to find it.  We were greeted warmly.  It is art by all veterans, though more by Viet Nam vets.  Many thought-provoking drawings and photographs.  Some sculptures.  One area highlights work by Kurt Vonnegut, and another is inspired by Tim O'Brien's books.  The O'Brien room is filled with stuff brought by soldiers.",National Veterans Art Museum,October 2019,40
"A worthy venture, a museum dedicated to Vietnam veterans",Taylor B,"How many military museums have you visited that are dedicated to veterans of the Vietnam War? It wasn't a popular conflict so, as a matter of political correctness, it usually receives second billing behind the Revolutionary War, American Civil War, World War I and World War II. But that isn't the case at the National Veterans Art Museum in Chicago. Located at 4041 North Milwaukee Avenue in the Portage Park neighborhood, it originally was known as the National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum. Established in 1981 and moved to its current address in 2012, it is dedicated to displaying and studying art produced by veterans of the Vietnam War and other wars and conflicts involving the American servicemen. The mission of the museum, which features nearly 2,500 works of art by more than 250 artists, is to inspire greater understanding of the impact of war through the collection, preservation and exhibition of art created by veterans of all U.S. military conflicts. Visitors experience a deeply moving and sobering exhibit when they enter the building. The entrance hall has 58,226 dog tags hanging from the ceiling, representing the U.S. soldiers who died in Vietnam. There also are works by author Kurt Vonnegut and exhibits on the Iraq and Afghan wars.",National Veterans Art Museum,November 2019,50

"A legendary, renovated neighborhood theater",Allen21096,"The Davis Theater was built and first opened in 1918  as the Pershing Theater.  Though it has closed and reopened a couple of times, that was 100 years ago.  In the 1930's, it was named the Davis Theater and in January 2016, the Davis Theater was completely renovated.  Everything seems to sparkle now - the lobby, the concession stand, the auditoriums and the restrooms.  There are three auditoriums and each has comfortable seating.  The staff was pleasant.  We came for a complimentary screening of a new TV show - Project Blue Book - which was interesting.  All of the prices are reasonable, though not as high as some of the major chains of theaters.  The only issue can be parking, but there are at least two relatively close public lots.  The staff is helpful & efficient.  There are plenty of events.  The Carbon Arc is a restaurant that is connected and from which you can get some menu items to take in to the theater, though we did not avail ourselves of that.  We're generally just popcorn or nacho moviewatchers.",Davis Theater,November 2018,50

We loved walking about the downtown streets, the sidewalks are generous, and there is no shortage of distraction - shops, restaurants, cafes, and A LOT of art.  Several friends said they thought Chicago was a dangerous city, but we felt very safe, and we did a lot of walking, both day and night. The ""L"" does make a loop downtown, but technically, The Loop seems to be the main part of downtown, bordered by the Chicago River and one of its arms, Lake Michigan, and one of the big avenues.  While we would not suggest never leaving The Loop, there's enough in The Loop to cover many days or even weeks of exploring.  A tip we gratefully received from a tour guide: If you see a nice looking building, new or old, open the door, go inside, and explore!

A Gem in our midst,TerryL1462,"This beautiful gem of a museum honors American Writers.

Wait for the Construction to be Completed,LJinSC,Approximately one third of the house is being refurbished.  At a minimum there should be a reduction in the tour pricing until the work is completed.,Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,October 2018,30
Fantastic tour of the neighborhood and many other Frank Lloyd Wright Homes,Wahoo428,"The Frank Lloyd Wright house and studio is wonderful.  Great tour with lots of interesting facts about him and his work. His studio was designed just as he did everything else, with a non cluttered place and a place for everything!",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,October 2018,50
Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece,Taylor B,"The Robie House is regarded as architect and designer Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece, internationally renowned as the greatest example of Prairie School architecture, the first architectural style considered uniquely American. Without this house, much of modern architecture as we know it today might not exist. In 1956, Architectural record selected Robie House as one of the seven most notable residences ever built in America."" In 2013, a PBS documentary called it one of 10 buildings that shaped America. ""House of the Century,"" one critic said. ""A magnificent work of art,"" said another. Located at 5757 South Woodlawn Avenue on the University of Chicago campus in the Hyde Park neighborhood, the 9,062-square-foot home was built between 1909 and 1910. Wright also designed the interiors, windows, lighting, rugs, furniture and textiles. The house was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1963, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and named a Chicago Landmark in 1971. Everything about this house is unique, one of a kind. On the exterior, the projecting cantilevered roof eaves, continuous bands of art-glass windows and the use of Roman brick emphasizes the horizontal line that reminded Wright of the American prairie. The interior is designed as two large rectangulars that seem to slide by one another. The southwest portion, or major vessel, includes the billiards room and children's playroom. On the second floor are the entry hall, living room and dining room. The northeast portion, or minor vessel, includes a guest bedroom, full bath, kitchen, butler's pantry, servants' sitting room, two bedrooms and a full bath. The third floor overlaps the major and minor vessels in the center of the building. Wright called the area Belvedere, as in ""the place in command of beautiful views."" The south side includes the master bedroom, dressing area, full bath and balcony. The north side includes two bedrooms and a full bath. The house has four fireplaces. Anyone care to guess how much the Robie House is valued in today's real estate market? My wife and I once toured Wright's magnificent house at Falling Water, Pennsylvania. Robie House is an entirely different experience. But equally as awe-inspiring.",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,November 2018,50
"Better in print, save yourself the trip",everythingsnicer,The house itself isn’t decorated and it is under renovation so you really miss out on the character of the home. Read the books in the souvenir shop for a much better idea of what the place looked like.,Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,November 2018,10
Great 360 view of the city,Bill246,Be sure to go on a clear day as the views are spectacular. The viewing deck is 103 stories high. It is best to have the City Pass as you not only get admission but also a shorter line to get  on the elevator which can save you a lot of time.,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,October 2019,50
view is stunning but time on deck is limited,Theresa C,"We waited in line for over an hour, which on a Saturday is to be expected. It's warm inside with all of the people in line. We waited patiently and the views at the top are stunning. I would suggest getting in line right away after you get off of the elevator. It's easy to get distracted and go from window to window to see the different views of the city. Save that for after you've gone on the deck. Once we finally got to the deck we were forced to share our minute of time on it with another family who were doing handstands and other distracting theatrics alongside of us. Very disappointing to wait that long only to share our allotted 60 seconds with another group. The staff at the deck rushed us which was again, disappointing. I expected a little more consideration given the money we spent.",Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,October 2019,30
Great view and worth the lines.,Joshua B,"The view from the Skydeck should be experienced by anyone visiting Chicago.  Standing out on the platform and looking out over the city is an experience that can't be replicated.  Be prepared for the lines.  There is a line to get tickets, a line to get to the observation deck, a line to get to the platforms, and a line to get back down the elevator.  There are great views all over the observation deck even without standing on out on the platform and the windows are clean and clear so you can take all the photos you want (except the one glass you walk on, that has shoe smudges). ",Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,August 2019,30
Good Way To See the City,enjoytravelingmore,First of all I suggest getting the Citi Pass if you're planning on going to more than one museum or site.  We didn't have to wait on line as the ticket is part of the Citi Pass.  It saved quite a bit of time.  On the top of Willis Tower you get a great 360 view of the city.  They also have glass windows you can stand on to get some great photos.  ,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,October 2019,40
Nice views of the city,Fred8K,"You can look out on all 4 sides to get good views of the city. But, it is just a city view, not a lot different than other city views.  Depending on weather (clouds), you can see Midway Airport and Ohare Airport.  Indiana and Wisconsin are visible on good days, and Michigan too. If it's a windy day, you can also feel the building sway a little back and forth (its supposed to do that, so don't worry if you feel it happening), and some people can't feel it at all anyway.  The line to the glass ledge that sticks out from the glass wall can get pretty long, but not really worth the extra $$$ for the fast pass (just wait in line, it isn't that long). In our case, the line to the elevator wasn't very long. The professional pictures are nice, but kind of pricey. Take plenty of your own pictures instead. The length of your stay will primarily depend on the line before the elevator.  Once you're to the top, I'd suggest about 1 hour (to get through the line to the glass box).",Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,October 2019,30
"Great example of a ""Prairie-style"" architecture",Sandra_TheTraveler,"Despite I haven't had a chance  to be on a tour inside of a Robie House, I have viewed it from outside and liked it very much  as  yet another masterpiece of Frank Lloyd Wright in his ""Prairie-style"" period.  2  other examples of this style are Frank Lloyd Wright House  and Studio in Oak Park, IL and Emile Bach House in Chicago(7415 N Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL)",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,November 2018,50

Art Nouveau USA,Rolf A,"Today known as Roosevelt University, the Auditorium Building by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan was the world's most influential building when it was new in 1889. Its interior decoration set the French and Belgians to adopt new ornament and glass techniques that by 1895 would be called Art Nouveau. Visit the interior by starting on the top floor to see plaster and woodworking and and then walk down the stairs looking at the stained glass and mosaic flooring. The windows are by Healy & Millet a Chicago firm that exhibited at the 1889 Paris World's Fair (the Eiffel Tower fair). The windows were written about in the French press and many artists/architects went to see them. The window glass came from Kokomo, Indiana. Kokomo sold lots of glass to Europe. It was a new style of glass and it became very popular in Europe from 1894-1915. Take the Auditorium only tour too, to get a full appreciation of the importance of the building.",Auditorium Building,April 2016,50
United Strikes Again,350peteg,"This poor company just can't get out of their own way. You'd think after the dragging incident the message would have filtered down to the entire employee base.  It has not.  So I've been a United Club Card member for years.  I recently switched jobs and could no longer justify paying $400 a year.  As part of the $400 fee you get access to the United Club. My Membership Card expires January 31st 2018.  So last Saturday I walked into the club in terminal 2 at O'Hare. I gave the card to the lady and she said I was not in the system. I told her I cancelled my Visa card.  She said club access automatically terminates and confiscated my membership card that was good through January. There were a few people behind me so I wasn't going to create a scene or inconvenience others.  I just shook my head and walked away. I have a few hundred thousand miles on United. One day I'll start flying more frequently.  Hey United, guess who just went to the bottom of the list.   They just don't get it.  I'm sure they can cancel my access if one reads the fine print. It's not a legal argument I'm making.  The fact is that I paid my $400 fee and my membership card didn't expire until next year.  Doesn't sit well with me at all.  Disappointing.

This was my daughters first lounge experience and she had the special joy of being woken up by an employee and sternly told that she is not allowed to sleep. There were two people right across from her asleep but nothing was said to them. Food is typical lounge fare, but when they put out the lunch items there is literally a guard in front of it to stop you from getting any until the exact moment that the change is supposed to happen. Who does this?!?!?!? Bartender was friendly and I enjoyed watching world cup with him and some others, but it was somewhat muted by hearing employees in the back area yelling at one another and complaining about everything under the sun.",United Club,July 2018,10
Great people,CRMays,The employees were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the food was not good. It was a neat room with several areas. We could sit at tables or in leather chairs.

Chicago's oldest surviving house,Taylor B,"I first became aware of the Henry B. Clarke House in 1977. It was quite by accident. I had been in an automobile accident (not my fault, by the way) in Bloomington, Illinois, while covering the State Amateur golf tournament for the Chicago Daily News. The damage was such that the car had to be loaded in a trailer and transported to a repair shop on Indiana Avenue on Chicago's Near South Side. So I went to the shop to pick up my car. It wasn't ready yet. ""Just an hour or two more,"" I was told. So what to do? I walked over to the Prairie Avenue Historic District. On my way back to the shop, I came face-to-face with the Clarke House, which was in the stage of being moved from its original location near 17th and Michigan Avenue to its present site at 1827 South Indiana. The chief contractor was there at the time and generously gave me a brief tour and a history lecture to boot. The skinny is the Clarke House, built in 1836, is the oldest surviving house in Chicago, having survived the Chicago Fire, the financial panic of 1937 and two moves. The Greek Revival style house originally was built on a 20-acre tract of land near Michigan Avenue between 16th and 17th Streets. Its current location in a park and gardens is part of the Prairie Avenue Historic District. The house now is a museum. The Clarke House was designated as a Chicago Landmark in 1970 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Henry B. Clarke came to Chicago from New York State in 1933 and entered the hardware business. He built his home on the South Side of the Chicago River, becoming the first wealthy Chicagoan to build there. In time, others followed and established mansions on Prairie Avenue. Clarke died in 1849. His widow lived in the house until 1860, selling land to support her family and to renovate the house. In 1871, John Chrimes purchased the house and moved it to 45th and Wabash Avenue in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In 1977, the City of Chicago purchased the house and moved it to its current location, an ambitious project that included lifting the entire building over the El tracks on the Englewood-Jackson Park line. Today, the Clarke House Museum is operated as a historic museum. It includes period furniture, decorative arts, ceramics, glassware, photographs, publications and archives that show what life was like for a family in Chicago during the city's formative years before the Civil War. Guided tours are available by arrangement with the neighboring Glessner House Museum on Prairie Avenue. Along with the Prairie Avenue mansions, it is an interesting step back into time to the Gilded Age of Chicago.",Clarke House Museum,January 2015,50

Very interesting,O6378WFannag,The most fascinating room is the Ignacy Paderewski room. ,Polish Museum of America,June 2017,40
Interesting tour...,eec317,"The website info is kind of confusing so here's my experience with how it currently works - the entrance for the tours is down some narrow stairs into the basement. You ring a bell and they open the door. However they will not let you in until 5 minutes before the tour starts. I tried to get there early as it said ""first come first serve"" but I was turned away. I don't think they really have enough visitors for the ""first come first serve to come into play"". The tour itself was good and can't complain much as it is free. My guide was great. Interesting to learn about the history of the house and how it is moved around. None of the furniture etc. is original to the house. The garden/park outside the house is beautiful.",Clarke House Museum,March 2016,40
"Oldest surviving house, Free on Wednesdays, but a few kinks to work out",LMFMarlboro,"2. The house itself, as I said, had some interesting items, and worth a look on a free day as long as you don't have be subjected to our guide. The ""restoration"" wasn't very authentic.",Clarke House Museum,May 2016,30
Unexpected highlight of the trip,sullivus,We were lucky to get two tour guides and learned a lot about the city of Chicago and how people lived during that time period.  I'm really glad we took the unexpected detour to visit this house - totally worth it.,Clarke House Museum,May 2017,50

Quaint,norma_gordon,"Clarke House Museum is surrounded by a lovely quiet park full of trees, flowers and a small pretty fountain. Entry to this park is free and there is a large path that twists around the whole area so it's great to go for a leisurely walk around with the whole family. Go for a picnic or just enjoy the peacefulness of the out doors.",Clarke House Museum,August 2016,40

Good to have this interesting museum in the neighborhood where you can park for free,O6378WFannag,Very nice & knowledgeable staff. We were free to browse around and we were able to have a guided tour for free! Very cool recreation of the artist studio. Great place for meetings and events.,Ed Paschke Art Center,March 2015,50
If you are Polish,TravelersBnH,Much history to learn for a first time visitor.  Need to go once if you have never been there.,Polish Museum of America,November 2011,40
Museum needs help!,catlapinski,"The museum was under some sort of construciton while we were there which is a good thing, the exhibits appear untended, some are dark displays where you cant see anything.  There are some very interesting pieces in the gallery and it is worth the price to go check it out. The librarian is very kind but do not expect any friendly faces in the museum.  The man in the gift shop, taking money for entry, was downright rude.  Having said that, the treasures inside are worth viewing.  Entry fee is very small I think we paid $7 each and there are no hidden fees. The gift shop has many trinkets, from jewlery to bumperstickers.",Polish Museum of America,September 2012,20
It was.. interesting.,Emmochka01,"I loved all of the photos and artifacts. There was also a lot of amazing war memorabilia! You have to be buzzed in, which is a bit odd. Once you get in, it is fine. There is currently a painting exhibit going on, but if you go in, the lady stays in there and watches you until you are done, which is kind of creepy. I might go back, I am not completely sure.",Polish Museum of America,November 2012,40
Guide made it worth the trip,GeauxHawks,"My friend and I have visited a lot of the bigger museums in Chicago so we decided to visit this museum while we were in the area. The collection is interesting (especially the Paderwski room, a room which rivals any exhibit in the larger museums), but what made the trip worth it was the guide who was working that day. He talked to us about a few of the exhibits and answered questions we had. You could see he clearly loved the museum and Polish history. If you are looking to go off the beaten path a little bit, I recommend checking out this museum.",Polish Museum of America,March 2013,40
Thought about stopping for years - and was glad I finally did!,DawnDawnDawn,"I found it surprising how large the building was and to find that the museum consisted of 3 floors.  The gift store was cute to browse through while waiting for our guide.  She was informative and explained the different exhibits and areas, gave us a little Polish history and then left us to explore.  The main room is breathtakingly large and the stained glass window is awesome.  We only had 45 minutes until closing time, but felt that left us plenty of time to see/read everything there.  Someone more interested in Polish history would probably need more time to spend.  They have obviously put a lot of love and care into this museum and it shows!",Polish Museum of America,April 2014,40
cute and FREE,lchicagolaw,An hour is enough here.  Right at the corner of Higgins and Milwaukee.  Lots to learn about the Chicago artist Ed Paschke.,Ed Paschke Art Center,February 2016,50
Worth the Trip,diggerdownChicago,It is a little out of the way from other attractions but is easily reached via the Blue Line and the Jefferson Park stop.  It is on the way between downtown and the airport.,Ed Paschke Art Center,May 2016,40
Love the fireworks,Joanne H,"We took in a White Sox game on a perfect Chicago evening, preceded by a pre-game tailgate complete with grill. Families and friends gathering around a grill in anticipation of a Sox victory is a sweet sight and a tradition. The fireworks when the Sox won were great!! Most games have a theme and a veteran is usually honored at each game. Check it out by taking the Red Line if you're not into tailgating, it's very convenient and there are diverse foods that you can buy in the stadium. It isn't just hotdogs and peanuts anymore.",Comiskey Park,July 2014,50
Go Sox!,Mountainsteve,Wasn't so sure when they rebuilt old Comiskey Park but this is a great place to cheer on the only baseball team in Chicago worth watching. Stadium food is well above average. Easy to catch the train to the stadium if you don't have a car. No tickets? No worries. Easy to buy on the street or at box office on game days.,Comiskey Park,June 2014,50
South Side FUN,Janine8363,Sox Park is fantastic.Home of the Chicago White SOX.   Where else can you rest on couches and wide screen TVs.  Or have dinner in the Stadium Club with fine dining accents.  The Chicago guide for families  that TripAdvisor published by Diana R seems to have forgot that some visitors might enjoy  south side attractions.  She also left out the Museum of Science and Industry and the DuSable Museum and the Tour of President Obamas neighborhood; just to mention a few.   Fireworks after every Sox Home Run and other special nights.  My favorite is Elvis Night..be sure to stay til the end where Elvis Parachutes in!  Great sun on the SOUTH SIDE.,Comiskey Park,August 2014,50
Field of Dreams,FrankieFile,"But you can still walk across the street from ""The Cell,"" our current baseball mall and stand at the spot commemorating the location of old Comiskey Park's home plate.

Small but tells an important story,SteveAntpitta,"This museum tells the story of Chicago's Chinatown, and the Chinese-American experience. There is a multimedia show, and many photos and artifacts. When I visited, there was also a special exhibition on the Chinese laborers who built a significant part of the transcontinental railroad. There was a very touching video interview with the late head of the Chinese Historical Society, and his effort to win recognition for the Chinese railroad workers. He was scheduled to speak at the 100th anniversary of the Golden Spike in 1969, but was left off the program to allow the addition of John Wayne. Secretary of Transportation John Volpe at the time said “Who else but Americans could have laid 10 miles of track in 12 hours?”, but it was mostly Chinese, who by law could not become Americans. The Chinese workers were also paid less than the white workers and paid for their own food, and amazingly slept outside in tents year round while the white workers slept in rail cars . A sad story of discrimination and exploitation.",Chinese-American Museum of Chicago,August 2019,50
History of the hidden immigrants in Chicago and the United States.,Mark T,Many immigrants built Chicago.But most of the people don't know history of Chinese American.I watched a video on Chinese Americans in Chicago.I also learned Chinese American's hard work to build rails.I thought this was an hidden history in the United States.I paid $5 donation.It closed at 2pm.Please visit!,Chinese-American Museum of Chicago,September 2019,50
Window into the Chinese immigration experience...,MaryWheeler,This is a small museum that focuses on the experience of Chinese people immigrating to America. It is a good complement to exploring Chicago's Chinatown. The main floor featured the building of the railroad in America and the Chinese workers' contribution. A new exhibit is due in 2020.,Chinese-American Museum of Chicago,September 2019,50
A wonder experience!,FayettevilleNC,This small but very interesting museum shares the story of Chinese Americans through their own eyes and words. There is an excellent film explaining the early immigration of Chinese to Chicago. There are also dozens of artifacts and documents that capture the rich history of the Chinese who came to America and called it their home. The staff was extremely attentive and even offered excellent suggestions for local cuisine.  This was our first stop on a self guided tour of China Town. I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in Chinese culture. ,Chinese-American Museum of Chicago,September 2019,50
Disappointing Visit,X5677AIjeffs,"The museum needs sprucing up and enhanced curation. The museum is spread over 3 floors and there was a guide who pointed towards areas and described what was there - beyond that there was not much as far as contextual information for why art and artifacts were grouped together. Many display cases had a sign apologizing for their condition and suggested that visitors make a contribution to the museum to help fix it up. There is a lot jammed into small areas - seems like they would have been better off showing less so that the focus could be on the really great items they have. Frankly, living not too far away, I really wanted to like this museum, but it was a let down.",Polish Museum of America,March 2018,20
Amazing collection ,O6378WFannag,"Amazing collection of artwork, sculpture, books and more. They also have a polish library and a gift shop. And they have their own parking lot. ",Polish Museum of America,December 2018,50
In search of my roots,andreabM559YK,"Had meant to visit this museum for years.  Did not expect a docent tour, but was happy that Bascia was generous and giving with her first-hand knowledge of Poland and its culture.  I learned a lot and walked away hungry for more of my Polish history.  I plan to return to visit the library.  The museum has historical artifacts as well as a small, but beautiful, art collection.",Polish Museum of America,February 2019,40
Interesting Place,bLiselotte,"Being in a union building there is a definite history here.  Lots of information on the creation of the Polish community in Chicago.  How this community in turn worked to free Poland during WWI.  There were great examples of Polish Paintings, Religious Art and military artifacts.  I really enjoyed my time here.

Many better musical theater opportunities in Chicago!,lchicagolaw,"Just saw ""Far from Heaven.""  The company was fine and the set was pretty creatively minimal, but the music and lyrics were just so horrible, that no amount of performance talent could fix how distracting the songs were from the story.  Why would they choose this show to do when there are so many great musicals available?",Porchlight Music Theatre,February 2016,20
Far From Heaven,Paulette P,"I do not agree with another reviewer. For the price of the ticket and location, this was a pleasant production. Musicians did a good job. Actors were convincing and storyline indicative of the period. The only thing we found annoying was the lack of information about parking. Valet is the only practical option for a show at four. Street parking is not long enough and nearby garage was closed. So, if you do not need a car, it is better. Staff helpful in suggesting local dinner fare. Seats comfortable. We would go back.",Porchlight Music Theatre,February 2016,40
Tiny theater-huge talents!,Norris A,Parking on the street would be hard to come by. There is a garage nearby on the same side of the street or if running late as we were there is a good valet service for $10. There's a cosy looking restaurant/bar called Coopers just across the street we'll try someday.,Porchlight Music Theatre,May 2016,40
Phenomenal!!,karenjH4902NS,I cannot say enough wonderful things about Porchlight! The talent is of the highest caliber. The theatre is in a great location with plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Chicago is a theatre town and Porchlight is one of its best!! I cannot wait to come back for the next show! Do not miss a Production at this fine theatre.,Porchlight Music Theatre,April 2018,50
Memphis is outstanding!,JohnRWestman,"What a talented cast that left me wondering why we haven't seen some of them on The Voice or America's got Talent.    The power brought me to tears during a couple of songs and after the show, my wife who is not easily moved said:   ""I've got to walk off some of my emotion.""   Simply outstanding people.. thank you for a wonderful afternoon.     If you haven't seen the show... run.. it's ending soon.",Porchlight Music Theatre,May 2018,50
Oldest house in Chicago,Ex3,This house is so historic and shows how middle class people lived 175 years ago. The docent was informative and knew how to make the story interesting!,Clarke House Museum,July 2018,50
Great Tour - Good House,Jeff P,Visiting the oldest standing house in Chicago is a nice story but the house is just okay.  The story of the Clarke family and how they struggled to save the house over the years is fascinating and really gives a good insight into the history of Chicago.  Our tour guide expertly told the story while she took us through the house.  What was a little disappointing with the house is that the furniture and artifacts weren’t original to the family but to the but rather the period.  It is always a plus to go into a historic house museum and see the original items they way the family would have lived.,Clarke House Museum,August 2018,40
Oldest surviving house in Chicago,Taylor B,"I still remember the first time I saw the Henry B. Clarke House. It was in 1977. The City of Chicago had purchased the house and moved it to its current location at 1827 South Indiana Avenue in the historic Prairie Avenue Historic District. I was in the neighborhood because my car was being repaired at a nearby shop. I was waiting for the work to be completed so I took a stroll around the neighborhood, past the Glessner House and other Gilded Age houses along South Prairie Avenue. And I turned the corner on South Indiana Avenue and came upon the Clarke House, which was undergoing restoration and renovation before being opened to the public. A workman invited me to come in and look around. It prompted me to do some historical research on Henry Brown Clarke and his house, often described as the oldest surviving house in Chicago. The Clark House was designated a Chicago Landmark in 1970 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Henry Brown Clarke, a native New Yorker, came to Chicago in 1833. He entered into the hardware business and provided building materials to the growing Chicago populace. The house was built in 1836. Originally built on 20.08 acres of land near Michigan Avenue between 16th and 17th Streets, it has been moved twice, most recently in 1977 to its current location at 1827 South Indiana Avenue, in a park and gardens that is part of the Prairie Avenue Historic District. Clarke's decision to build south of the Chicago River made him the first wealthy Chicagoan to build there. Clarke died in 1849 after being stricken with cholera. His widow lived in the house until 1860. She renovated the house, adding an elaborate back portico with Doric columns and an Italianate cupola. In 1871, John Chrimes, a prominent Chicago tailor, bought the house and moved it farther south to 45th and Wabash in what was then a township of Hyde Park. Later, it was the working home of Bishop Louis Henry Ford, for whom the Bishop Ford Expressway was named. In 1977, the house was moved to its current location, a project that included lifting the entire building over the El tracks on the Englewood-Jackson Park line. Today, the Clarke House Museum is operated as a historic house museum by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. Guided tours are available by appointment with the neighborhood Glessner House Museum.",Clarke House Museum,November 2018,50
Good audio tour,SteveAntpitta,"We went during one of the scheduled tours of the house. The tour guide was not available, but there was a limited number of audio tour devices.Latecomers could view the house's exhibits without the benefit of the audio, or wait for one to be returned. The story of the house, and the development of Chicago, is very interesting. It had been moved twice, and is now near where it was originally. The furnishings and decor are mostly not original, but are of the period.The grounds around the house are also lovely, with an interesting sculpture by Louise Bourgeois in the garden. The house is well worth a visit.",Clarke House Museum,August 2019,40
Simply Amazing,robssp,Yesterday I had the privilege of touring the Clarke House in Chicago. This historic old building is beautiful. More impressive than the building was the tour guide Brenda Bohen’s knowledge of the history and construction of the building. The additional background information about the Clarke family was also extremely interesting. I enjoyed the tour so much that I came back to take the tour a second time. I feel very fortunate to have this experience and hope to take more tours with Brenda in the future.,Clarke House Museum,October 2019,50
Essential,Terence M,To the Chicago experience along with the Elmhurst Art Museum and Elmhurst College Library. All can be managed in a day trip to north-west Chicago.,Ed Paschke Art Center,August 2018,50
Small interesting art center ,dvkremk,We took the Blue Line out to Jefferson Park to see the art center. It was just a short walk from the train. We hadn't known much about Ed Paschke prior to our visit. They had a half hour video where he discusses art - which was interesting.  They also have a recreation of his art studio.  I enjoyed learning about him and his art work.  Entry was free.  We were there about an hour.  ,Ed Paschke Art Center,August 2018,40

"Have you seen Vaca Victoria, the controversial cow?",Taylor B,"The Ed Paschke Art Center in Chicago is a different kind of art museum. All you have to do is examine the exhibit of Vaca Victoria, the controversial cow, and you'll know what I mean. Located at 5415 West Higgins Avenue, in the heart of Jefferson Park, it opened in 2014, on what would have been Ed Paschke's 75th birthday, as a tribute to the legendary Polish-American artist's work and life. Housed in a renovated building, the museum features 2,800 square feet of exhibition space and 1,700 square feet of educational space, alongside a re-imagination of Paschke's Howard Street studio. Paschke was born, raised, lived and worked on Chicago's Northwest Side and, as a Polish American, his ethnic heritage reflects part of the community's own diversity. The museum is open daily from 10 to 7. Admission is free. We were most interested in Paschke's Vaca Victoria. Remember Chicago's ""Cows on Parade"" exhibit from June to October in 1999, featuring over 300 cow sculptures embellished by local artists that went on public display throughout the city? Did you take pictures of them all? Like us, you probably missed Vaca Victoria, which stood at 215 West Superior in River North for just three days before it was removed because of the controversial gang signs that Paschke covered the cow with. Less controversial were other elements of the composition, like the head painted in the style of the Chicago Bulls logo. He signed his name over the cow's haunches, similar to a cattle brand. ",Ed Paschke Art Center,November 2019,50
Fun time; Nice Stadium,GolfGuy777,"Went to see the White Sox since the Cubs were not in town.  Had no expectations of the ""new"" Comiskey Park.

Decent Place to Go to Baseball ,RRH01,This stadium is not the best in baseball but it is not as bad as people make it out to be.  There are lots food choices. The biggest downside of this park is the area around the park. There is really nothing to do in the area. You don’t want to get there too early. Take the train.  ,Comiskey Park,June 2018,40
I rather spend my time at Wrigley,matjaz2002,Not fan of either Chicago team but Wrigley has the history and places around it and of course u have to root for the Cubs. If your in Chicago its not worse to come here.,Comiskey Park,August 2018,30
liked it,Gizmo4ever,"Its not wrigley but really enjoyed it. The white sox usually are not good, so easy to get good seats cheap and the stadium itself is much nicer. It is real close to the trains and chinatown where you can really get some great asian food. One thing though, DO NOT cross the highway as you are in a bad neighbourhood known for crime and its high murder rate.

Did you find Studs Terkel's burial site?,Taylor B,"Washington Square Park isn't what it used to be. But the three-acre rectangular park on Chicago's North Side remains the oldest existing park in Chicago and a popular gathering place for dog-walkers and locals who enjoy the tranquility of the central Victorian fountain, flowerbeds, lawn, trees, limestone coping, picket fencing, diagonal walking paths and benches. Located at 901 North Clark Street, across Walton Street from Newberry Library, Washington Square Park was founded in 1842 and once was best known as Bughouse Square, alluding to its history as a favorite place for orators to address crowds and pontificate their opinions. From the early 20th century to the 1960s, the square was  the most celebrated open air free-speech center in the country as well as being a popular Chicago tourist attraction, drawing poets, preachers, college professors, anarchists and anyone who wanted to step on a soapbox and address a crowd on any topic. One of the most eloquent orators was Studs Terkel, the late and legendary Chicago journalist, author and broadcaster. His ashes are said to be buried under a tree on the property. But which one? Washington Square Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.",Washington Square Park,January 2019,50
Loved it!,Dr_Bob1,"We found this small park near our hotel by chance.

The prices were decent and the staff was very attentive. My favorite beers (which I can’t recall the names), going on two ends of the spectrum, were the Mexican lager and the coffee based.

Comfortably sized venue with big theatre,jaz79h,"We came here for ""Queen"" with a season ticket holder. Our first time, one of many for her. I can understand why she's here often! Ensemble-style play (so several very good actors, vs. a ""star""). Really engaging theatre in every aspect, especially the story and character development. Great space--felt like just several dozen seats the way it was laid out, although bigger. And theatre held a discussion group afterwards for women in science to talk about their experience in the context of the play. We'll be back.",Victory Gardens Theater,April 2017,50
Theatre inspires,Katherine Q,"What masterful story telling! Victory Gardens never shies away from the gut wrenching, to the taboo, to the scary, to the intense.

Architectural gem,ScottyG777,"This is one of the most famous buildings of my architecture education.  The Monadnock Building was the world's largest office building when it was finished in 1893.  It's a masonry masterpiece and is supported by the material (brick) it's made of, not a hidden steel structure like most other buildings are today.  The walls on the street level are about six feet thick to support the upper stories.  It's been restored and there are some cool shops and a couple of restaurants inside.  I highly recommend a visit and at least a walk through this historic architectural gem.",Monadnock Building,April 2012,50
This is the only place that tells this huge part of Chicago's story!,StorytellerG,"Just as interesting as what's inside the museum is the setting it's in. Bridgeport is an ancient neighborhood, as neighborhoods go in Chicago. But it's current revival from a place full of empty old warehouses and dead factories to one of the liveliest hotspots of art, culture and diversity makes a visit to the CMM even more of a deep Chicago experience than a visit to many of the City's larger museums.

Chriskindelmarket,227karenl,"Daley Plaza hosts Chriskindelmarket, an outdoor market with traditional German food, drinks, bakery items, Christmas ornaments and other trinkets. This is wildly popular, for good reason. The German food was authentic (brats, potato pancakes, gingerbread, mulled wine, etc.) and the people were in a very upbeat and patient mood. The drawback is that the space is too small for the crowds, although Chicago crowds seem to be far less aggressive than, say, New York City. So glad we stopped by for lunch!",Daley Bicentennial Plaza,December 2017,40
Christkindlmarkt... terribly crowded on weekends,alyeska13,"After visiting various Christkindlmarkts throughout Europe, we were hoping to re-live the magical atmosphere of that special time before Christmas with fairy lights, interesting things to purchase, nice music, and delicious foods and gluwein. This one was extremely disappointing because of the horrible crowds.  The variety of gifts to buy and interesting foods to taste would have been wonderful, but my kids, husband, and I were so overwhelmed by the crowds that we just couldn't stand it for long, and the lines for everything were ridiculously long. I would love to go back on a week day some time to try some of the food and not have to wait an hour for it.  It definitely made me nostalgic for the markets in Europe though, and I think we would have enjoyed it if there had been fewer people.  We tried to go during the day and also in the evening, but if anything it was more crowded at night.  We seriously could barely walk through the crowds and had to hold on to each other so we wouldn't lose anyone.  This would be a terrible place to take young children unless you go at a less crowded time.  The Christkindl was no where in sight, but even she would have been smashed in the masses of people.  We were VERY happy to see Krampus and were able to purchase a number of unusual Krampus gifts and chocolates. (He's kind of a boogeyman who goes around with St. Nicholas to scare children into being good... deliciously creepy if you're a child!)   It really was so crowded earlier in the day so that only my daughter and I even attempted the trip back at night.  We only stayed a few moments before deciding to move along to other shopping.  We will not be going back on a weekend, that's for sure!",Daley Bicentennial Plaza,December 2017,30

So disappointing and such rude people and organization,madonnas,"We were on a baseball week visiting stadiums and attending games in Milwaukee and Chicago.  We purchased rooftop tickets because we were told this was the thing to do and we figured this is a once in a lifetime event for us.  We purchased to stay on Sheffield Rooftop which was kind of middle of the road ticket.  When we get there we were told the rooftop had been rented out and we were sent at least two rooftops over which basically put us in foul territory.  Which if we purchased this ticket originally would have been cheaper.  But no refund.  They treated us terribly.  When they found out we were from out of town the gentlemen said what does it matter you're not even fans.  Such disrespect for the sport and the fan.  I know in NY any fan would be flattered to help you out and show off our venues.  During the National Anthem, I looked at the rooftop next to us and I was appalled to see most people who were not sitting in a bleacher not standing or showing any respect.  In my opinion the rooftops are just a club or night out, baseball is really the last thing on everyone's mind.  Also the food in the rooftop we got switched too was terrible.  So disappointed, left a bad taste in my mouth regarding Cub fans and Wrigley field.  Luckily we went on tour of Wrigley so we were able to see the stadium.  I was with my family and it's been a long time since we felt so disappointed and ripped off and taken advantage of.  Nasty people.  DON'T DO THIS!!!!!!

Beautiful Building and Stained Glass Windows,1967Yankeesfan,"I was walking around the city fairly early on Friday morning, around 8 am. I saw that the church doors were opened, so I walked inside. I had already been impressed by the gorgeous building on the outside. When I went inside, I was even more impressed! The building is simply beautiful. Long and narrow like so many English churches. The pulpit was raised and the wood carvings inside are magnificent. I had a chance to talk with the organist for a few minutes and was really excited to see that the church was open for the community to use, whether the homeless to sit in a safe place, or a wanderer who wanted to get out of the sun.",Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago,May 2016,40
"Spectacular interior, Tiffany and Burne_Jones Windows",Rolf A,"This church interior is a must to visit in Chicago. It's unique combination of Arts and Crafts by Howard Van Doren Shaw with superb stained glass windows by Tiffany, Burne-Jones and others as well as one of a kind murals by Frederic Clay Bartlett. There is also superb compatible metal work, carpets and stone carving.  ",Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago,July 2016,50
Tiffany windows- should be in Chicago's top 100 must-sees,94debran,"Not far from the loop, this church is well worth adding to your tourist itinerary. The Arts & Crafts style interior would be worth seeing on its own, but the windows steal the show. The Tiffany windows span several decades so you can see the development of his work, with the piece on the far right nearest the alter featuring all of his patented techniques, including confetti glass. The non-Tiffany windows are also impressive, for example the the meticulously painted on draping on the blue dress pictured here. Don't miss the angel standing on a dragon to your left in the main vestibule as you exit to the street. She has some fun socks!",Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago,October 2016,50
Beautiful windows - come when there’s a docent,LovingNewAdventures,We just poked our head in while the singers were warming up before a service and wandered by the windows in the balcony.  They are impressive—and seriously in need of restoration.  In fact one has been removed and they are planning a film to document the process.  I am not sure which windows are Tiffany and I wish we’d picked a time when a docent could tell us about them.  ,Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago,March 2018,40
Nice,ill007,Went to the roof top to catch a game and was very pleased with the experience. I will say that this is not a environment for true baseball lovers who want to really watch the game!

Great way to see a game!,msnewll,"Went to a rooftop to catch a game as part of a team-building/work event. I agree with EV - not an environment for a true baseball fan.

However, my daughter is named Brixen Ivy and ahead of time I contacted, Ryan that runs that building.  He was kind enough to meet us prior to their opening and give us a tour, let us take pictures and just sit and enjoy the view of Wrigley.  You couldn't ask for a nicer gesture.  He didn't charge us a dime, and it meant a lot to us.  I wouldn't hesitate to book a group outing on the Brixen Ivy Builiding.

I am amazed at the architecture of this building it's round and the elevators are very fast and all glass. One of the coolest buildings I've seen. And the floors are over looking one another it designer went over and beyond the realm when creating it. One of Chicago's must see buildings.

Christkindlmarket -- crowded but with tasty treats and unique gifts,Robert J,"We went to Daley Plaza the week before Christmas on a weeknight and it was jammed with people at the Christkindlmarket.  After first wading through a surrounding ring of panhandlers (nothing like Christmas guilt!), we enjoyed various treats on a frosty evening.  We are vegetarian so usually don't find too much to eat when it is German cuisine, but they had options for us too, including vegetarian bratwurst.  The guy selling English toffee cleaned out our wallets after giving my wife and daughter-in-law samples!

Highly recommended for beer nerds and their friends!!",Motor Row Brewing,October 2017,50
Don't go out of your way. ,mtade2016,"Traveled from Northwest Indiana to visit this place. Quite disappointing. There are some great breweries to visit in Chicago - majors like Half Acre and Lagunitas, and smaller locals like Finch's and Argus - but Motor Row doesn't come close. The beer was okay, the atmosphere was sterile - like a Subway restaurant, the music was horrible, and the staff acted like we had arrived too early for a party. I'll acknowledge that we visited on a Sunday evening, not exactly prime time, but I've had plenty of pleasant Sunday night visits to similar establishments. Maybe the Thursday Blues nights would be worthwhile, but just based on the quality of their beer and atmosphere of the brewpub, I can't really recommend this place. There are WAY better options a half hour away in Northwest Indiana. ",Motor Row Brewing,November 2017,20

I only saw outside - would love to see inside next time!,farmbrough,"This building is a little deceptive. It has been restored and renovated many times during its existence, and looks rather modern at first sight. In fact it was built in the Victorian era, in one of the gaps left after the great fire of Chicago, with construction starting in 1891. One thing I appreciated was the cast-iron work on the outside as shown in the accompanying photograph, but if you are able to go inside, you will see some beautiful mosaic tiling and woodwork.

Visit the shops in this gem of a building,ChicagoTexas,"I discovered the beauty of this structure when I visited the Florodora dress and shoe shops on the south end of the building (ladies, peruse the stores, they're pricey but feature local designers and beautiful merchandise). When you walk through the interior you can appreciate the architecture as well as the turn of the century vibe the shops inspire.  You'll find a hatmaker, shoe repair, flower shop, coffee shop, restaurant, old fashioned barber shop and the Florodora boutiques inside. Don't miss the enormous and beautifully embellished mail box as you enter from the north end on Jackson. Read up on the building's history and look at it from Dearborn St. You'll find the north and south ends were built at different times. Get a taste of what 1940s Chicago was.

Tucked away sandy beach with plenty of room,KimRChicago,"Just north of Montrose Harbor beach, which is crowded and often dirty, there is a quieter, cleaner sandy beach at Foster Avenue with a brick bathhouse, and a bicycle rental.  You cannot see the beach from the park road, so you have to walk through the building.  Above the beach is a grass parkland with shade trees.  People who do not want to get wet or sandy can picnic in the grass which catches a pleasant waterside breeze.  Foster Beach is sunny, safer, cleaner and quieter than others in the park.  Wheelchair accessible with a ramp.  Drawbacks include the necessity to pay to park because you cannot park on the road.  This discourages people who do not want to spend a couple of dollars.  There is a home style Mexican taco stand with real corn tortillas that is like camping out with an open grill.  So no restaurant here, but overall a nice experience.",Foster Avenue Beach,July 2013,40

Miserable when crowded,L H,"It’s fun to skate outside on Michigan Avenue, unfortunately safety is not a priority; the staff are usually too busy chatting, showing off, or playing with their phones to pay attention to what’s happening on the ice (in bad weather they even leave the ice to go stand under shelter); beginners flail around, skating in the wrong direction, cutting off/running into people while busy with their phones; groups of teens stand & chat instead of skate. The Zamboni is either wearing out or poorly operated, as the ice isn't totally smooth to start, and gets choppy very quickly. Free if you bring your own skates, rental lines can be extremely long weekends/holidays.

He hand picks who works at the club and who belongs to the club. I find this to be very disturbing. None of the employees at the East Bank Club like Simon. We are all waiting for the day he gets fired. If you are a member here, I would highly recommend going to a club like Lakeshore, Lifetime, LA Fitness or FFC. There is also the chicago area clubs.

How happy I was to find that instead of being outside on cold bleachers, we were inside a nearby building with large windows and TVs that looked out on the field. The food was delicious and all-you-could eat (including ice cream pops!) and unlimited beer and wine. What a perfect place for a party. We met people from all over, and really enjoyed ourselves. Thank you for such a brilliant idea.",Wrigley Rooftops,May 2019,50

We were intrigued with it's beauty as we passed by it on the interstate in heavy traffic. Finally, we decided to drive over to see it. This Church is downtown, in the Pulaski Park neighborhood, and is incredible. We are attaching lots of pictures, because trying to describe it would not do it justice.

It can be really frustrating if you don’t know what you’re in for, especially if you’re there on a weekend like I was. Having been warned ahead of time by a friend, I wasn’t surprised when it was so crowded that I couldn’t even stop to look at many of the booths. However, I still had a good time and did get to do a little bit of shopping. This is not an activity I need to do every year, but once in a while it’s fun.

Christkindlmarket,Ortsac,"We were so disappointed with Christkindlmarket.  It was one of the main reasons why we decided to visit Chicago in December.  I realize it’s Chicago and there will be crowds, but this was ridiculous.  The space was too small to handle that many people and you had to push your way through to get anywhere.  It was nearly impossible to shop or really enjoy the experience.  There has to be a way to open the space up more to handle the crowds.  It was just too confined.",Daley Bicentennial Plaza,December 2018,20

In November, we visited the Christkindlmarket which fills the plaza with vendors selling holiday food and crafts. Given that it was opening weekend and probably some of the best weather the market will have all season, it was expectedly crowded, but the air was buzzing with holiday cheer. From German potato pancakes with salmon and herbed sour cream to savory Samosa pies from India, our group found plenty to eat, and We enjoyed it all. We even brought home a hand carved dragon to remind us of our visit to the Christmas market in Chicago.",Daley Bicentennial Plaza,November 2019,50

Dedicated to the study and memorialization of Chicago's maritime traditions,Taylor B,"As a matter of full disclosure, I wasn't aware that Chicago had a maritime museum. Now I am. Opened in 2016, at 1200 West 35th Street, in the Bridgeport neighborhood, the Chicago Maritime Museum is dedicated to the study and memorialization of Chicago's maritime traditions. It asserts that Lake Michigan and the Chicago River were key factors in Chicago's growth and its development as a world-class city. Chicago's maritime history hit its peak during the ""Golden Age"" of the American steamboat, when small but fast steamers carried passengers and freight over the Great Lakes to Chicago before and during the Civil War. At the same time, canal boats paraded up and down the newly dug Illinois and Michigan Canal from Chicago to the Illinois River and even the Mississippi River. According to the museum, Chicago's ship-docking operations in 1872 exceeded that of any other port in the United States. Today, the Chicago Maritime Museum has a collection of over 6,000 items of tangible maritime heritage. Interestingly, it is located adjacent to a former working tributary of the Chicago River, Bubbly Creek, made famous in Upton Sinclair's book on Chicago's meat packing industry. It also celebrates industrial Lake Calumet and the beaches, deep tunnels and pumping stations of Chicago and pays tribute to Chicago's Irish-American community, which dug many canals and was a key support group within the city's maritime history. Admission is free.",Chicago Maritime Museum,March 2019,50

Luckily Motor Row came up,the building is on the street and to access the tap room, on arrival we were met by the knowledgeable bar staff who described the types of beer and we started chatting to a gentleman at the bar who turned out to be the owner and brewer of the beer and a top guy, we luckily got there 30 mins after they had just tapped a hoppy watermelon beer that went down a treat ,if you wanted food they were more than happy for you to order in and eat there, they also have a popcorn machine and when cooked it is help yourself,  so if you are at the conference centre and fancy an excellent beer nip here you won't be disappointed ",Motor Row Brewing,July 2019,50

Tallest Load-Bearing Brick Building,dvkremk,The building is open to the public and you can walk through - and also go up stairs.

We were up quite high but still had a great view. Only negative is there isn’t a great atmosphere to support the team - it seems like only half the people at the stadium were actually interested in the game.

Our section atttendant was so helpful (Jamell). He directed me to the family area when my little one needed some quiet and answered a slew of other questions I had during the game about where things were. The concession stand attendants were nice, easy to deal with and the people in the first aid room(the quiet family place) were very nice!

Everyone was very nice and helpful which is great when traveling and doing events with small children.",United Center,March 2019,50
Great arena for hockey,brucep460,Nice up-to-date Arena just west of downtown Chicago for about 10 minutes. It's amazing the fans that are here that they packed them in and sell it out even when their team is doing as terrible as they are this year. Great food options though they are sold out of the Giordano's Pizza half an hour before the game even starts which kind of blows my mind. Clean environment nice concessions and walkways. Security is good. Parking is plentiful all around the arena and open parking lots for about $20. The pre-show that they do on the ice is pretty cool but not as good as what they do for the Bulls basketball. Good sight lines all around. And if you want to see the Michael Jordan famous Nike Dunk sculpture go to the atrium that's on the east side. Very nice Atrium with plenty of pregame activities going on. They do need to fix it where you can go in with a mobile ticket instead of having to have them printed out that is kind of weird as nobody does that anymore.,United Center,March 2019,50

Spending a cultural day at the University of Chicago,Taylor B,"The David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art isn't in the same class with the Art Institute of Chicago or the Museum of Contemporary Art. But its permanent collection contains over 15,000 objects, from modern art to Asian art to European art to contemporary art, and combining a visit with tours of Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House and the Oriental Institute makes for a wonderful cultural experience at the University of Chicago. Located at 5550 South Greenwood Avenue, the Smart Museum of Art was established in 1974 and named after the Smart brothers, the Chicago-based publishers of Esquire, Coronet, Teriade and Verve magazines and founders of Coronet Films. The museum's modern art collection features paintings by Paul Delvaux, Arthur Dove, Walt Kuhn, Norman Lewis, Jean Metzinger and Diego Rivera and sculpture by Jean Arp, Edgar Degas and Auguste Rodin. One of the most notable items in the collection is the original dining room furniture designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for the Robie House. The Asian collection includes literati scroll paintings from China, Japan and Korea, Buddhist sculpture, ceramics and prints. The European collection focuses on art created before 1900, including paintings by Cecco Bravo, Luca Cambiaso, Donato Creti, Jan Steen and Paolo Veronese. Other notable works include Goya's The Disasters of War and paintings by Gustave Caillebotte, Louis Dupre and Jean-Baptiste Regnault. The contemporary collection includes works by John Chamberlain, Andy Warhol, Robert Irwin and Claire Zeisler, several Chicago artists and more recent works by Nick Cave, Kerry James Marshall, Dan Peterman and Richard Hunt. The Smart Museum and the adjacent Cochrane-Woods Art Center, which houses classrooms and offices for the University of Chicago's department of art history, are unadorned modernist buildings linked by covered walkways and face a common outdoor sculpture garden. The buildings are covered in Indiana limestone in a simple but sophisticated design and relate to the Gothic architecture and quadrangles found elsewhere on the campus. The lobby of the museum features a vaulted ceiling with a north facing clerestory window. The museum is open to the public with no general admission fee or special charge for exhibitions.",Smart Museum of Art,November 2018,50

A wonderful alternative to the Art Institute of Chicago,Taylor B,"The world-famous Art Institute of Chicago gets most of the publicity, and deservedly so, but if you are trying to avoid crowds (remember the Normal Rockwell exhibit?), a wonderful alternative is the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago. Located at 5550 South Greenwood Avenue, it is an art museum that features more than 15,000 objects, is open to the general public and admission is free. Established in 1974, the Smart Museum of Art and the adjacent Cochrane-Woods Art Center were designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes. The Smart collection is displayed in four permanent galleries dedicated to modern art, Asian art, European art and contemporary art. One of the most notable items in the collection is the original dining room furniture designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for the Robie House. The museum also maintains an archive of artwork, sketchbooks, letters, tools, original woodblocks and other personal material related to the life and work of H.C. Westermann.

LONG WAIT,Karen C,"BUY YOUR TICKETS AHEAD OF TIME ONLINE!! We did not know to do this and suffered the consequences.  When you arrive you stand in line to buy tickets which took us about an hour and a half because they had one person selling tickets!  Ridiculous.  Then you walk to another room and present your tickets to stand in line again.  Then you turn a corner to realize you are standing in line in yet another room.  Once you get to the front, your group gets into an elevator and goes up the 103 floors while watching a short video about the experience.  It’s inportant to know that parties of 3 or less get ONLY 60 seconds in the box and parties larger get 90 seconds.  They time it!  So plan ahead what poses for pictures you want because that times expires quickly.  Even after all of the waiting, it was pretty cool and a unique experience.  My daughter loved it.  I think I would have enjoyed it more had we bought our tickets online or If more than one person would have been selling tickets. The whole experience from start to finish took over 3 hours. Would I do it again?  Probably not but it was definitely something I’m glad we did.",Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,October 2019,30

At the end we got the opportunity to do some blues karaoke and also play blues guitar.  I think you would need a full day at least to do the museum justice.  I'd definitely recommend a visit if you want to know more about the history of Chicago or if you just need somewhere to shelter from a winter storm!",Chicago History Museum,April 2019,40
Great exhibit tour.,rr0ver,"Best part of visit was the tour. It was very interesting and informative, and the tour guide was very knowledgeable and engaging.  We visited on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend and found the museum nicely busy but not crowded.",Chicago History Museum,May 2019,40
Amazing children's paradise playground,Roadmr,"This park is huge and has so many themed playground areas that our toddler conked out after only 4. A real-life castle with two suspension bridges, slides galore, ships, water fountains, you name it, they got it. It's amazing.",Maggie Daley Park,June 2019,50
A small museum but filled with an amazing collection of art.,Glutton567,"This is one of Chicago's hidden gems.  It is small and can be seen in fairly quickly. an hour to a few hours depending on how in depth your viewing takes you. The collection is excellent and much of it rotates on a regular basis. I go there often.  Parking is pretty easy especially on weekends and during university vacation periods when the students are away.  Probably not a destination by itself but the Hyde Park neighborhood is filled with interesting sites. (great bookstores, other museums, historic architecture {not just the Robie House}.",Smart Museum of Art,May 2016,50
Little Gem worth the visit,AlWalavich,"The Smart Museum must be one of the most overlooked gems in Chicago.  Small in size with a very eclectic permanent collection that rotates annually, the museum also hosts special temporary exhibits on a wise range of topics.  The show on Classicism currently on display is fascinating and well worth the trip to the campus/",Smart Museum of Art,April 2017,50
Some great pieces and lots of diversity,Cheryl H,"When we visited, the Museum had galleries devoted to Modern Art, to Classicism past and present, and to Asian art.  There was also a special exhibit of a German Fluxus artist.  I found the curation enjoyably educational; no doubt U of Chicago art professors have a great deal to do with this presentational pleasure.  The museum is small, and the lobby is a bit dingy.  The cafe does a pretty good espresso, but when we were there the food choices were dismal.  However, once inside the glass doors we were happy and fully entertained for almost 2 hours.",Smart Museum of Art,May 2017,50
Outstanding curation of a large collection skillfully displayed in limited space,Bill J,"The eclectic but impressive collection will surprise you given the comparatively limited space at Smart compared to the Art Institute, for example.  However, the pieces on display from the permanent collection are virtually all gems.  Bonus: you'll never be overwhelmed by the sheer size of what's on display.  The current exhibition on Classicism in art is a fascinating view of a subject you probably weren't dearly looking forward to seeing. Sources from very large museums around the world again make an impact far greater than you'd expect.  One you'll leave satisfied that you saw it.",Smart Museum of Art,May 2017,50
Kind of a Waste of Time,MrSaturn64,"The Smart Museum is a little gallery at the University of Chicago, with two galleries, each housing temporary modern exhibits, with some older things thrown in.  Unfortunately, it was just about completely forgettable.  There were maybe two interesting pieces, including a table by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the rest was just meh.  The building was decent.  With all the things in Hyde Park to do, this really shouldn't be topping any lists of places to go.",Smart Museum of Art,August 2017,20
Exceptional Park near Millenial Park,Kemper4,"This is a great park for kids to cut loose and enjoy while getting plenty of exercise.  One downside is that there is s very small ""sight line"" due to the hills, valleys, and vegetation, so therefore I recomend having no more than a 2:1 ratio of kids to adults, or at least have strict check back rules in place.  It's safe, but easy to lose sight of your kids if you don't pay attention.",Maggie Daley Park,June 2019,40

The zoo,PSlowly,"Probably the best city zoo we have ever visited and it's free! We took several hours walking around the enclosures, listening to staff talk about their charges and watching feeding time. The restaurant is rather basic and expensive but, given this is a way for funds to be raised, no complaints. The volunteers are passionate about the zoo and should be congratulated for their dedication and knowledge.

Best escape from the city,Lexa D,"Surrounded by a concrete jungle, this place is an amazing escape. The plants are well taken care of and it is huge with tons of different rooms to explore.

It is small but often has well-curated special exhibits that are accompanied by gallery talks, events for kids, symposia and other events.

Small but well done,dven8,"Very nicely done museum on the University of Chicago campus.  Absolutely free, with a nice cafe and very friendly staff.

Well worth a stop if you are in Hyde Park.",Smart Museum of Art,February 2016,40

Worth a Look,panama2000,"It is a little bit tucked away, but well worth the visit. If you are in town to see the Robie house, be sure to stop here to see the diningroom table.

Brewery Tour,Y2581QFmattheww,"Me and my fiancé visited the brewery during a week long stay in Chicago for New Year. We have been on a number of similar tours throughout the UK and Belgium as well as multiple vineyards and distillers. I must say that this was the most enjoyable one of the lot! Really informative tour including a sample of a few beers! What’s not to like! The Goose Island set up is impressive and it felt like we were really getting an insight into how the beer is made. Special mention to the tour Guide Tyler from Iowa, he definitely made the tour with his good humour and knowledge. Highly recommend the tour, one of the best things we did in Chicago! We got the Green line to Ashland and walked, but personally I think the best option would be to get a taxi. ",Goose Island Beer Co.,December 2018,50

Besides that, our tour guide was super cool and very funny and kept the whole group entertained. The beer was of course delicious and the vibe of the tasting room was very fun. Plenty of parking, and still close enough to downtown that it’s a very easy Uber ride. I will definitely be back soon!",Goose Island Beer Co.,January 2019,50
Worth the time -- visit it!,O1423ORmarias,"Unlike a museum with a vast and permanent collection, the American Writers Museum in Chicago reminds me of a collage of writers' achievement...ever-changing and distinctive. It is organized but in a free-associational kind of way. I loved hearing Langston Hughes' reading of a poem that is often excerpted to just eight lines but actually extends further. On a wall nearby was an enlarged drawing from Frank L. Baum's Dorothy, Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, etc. I was impressed to see that there were typewriters on display and a chance for participants to do some hands-on work. I had a terrible headache when I entered (migraine sufferers will empathize), but due to the low lighting I could handle a few walks through. A temporary exhibit of Bob Dylan's achievements (and guitar) and Frederick Douglass's writing (and over 160 photos!) left me feeling I had learned something new. Who is a writer who has ""made it?"" That could be a hands-on activity, too. I loved the small gift shop but kept my purchases frugal.",American Writers Museum,January 2019,40

The tour guide we had was excellent at conveying his enthusiasm for Wright and it was catching.  The only disappointment is that, due to lack of government funding (America really needs to think about its history and heritage) the building is still undergoing renovation which means some of Wright’s aesthetic ideas are if not lost then hidden, by scaffolding and working crew.

Luckily we did make it out to Oak Park, but just seeing this building would be an excellent ""second choice"" it you didn't have more time.  It's isn't quite representative of what we recognize now for Frank Lloyd Wright's work (he redesigned the atrium here), as it is still quite early in his career.

"One of ""Chicago's best kept secrets""",Taylor B,"Visitors quickly learn that the Museum of Science and Industry, located at South Lake Shore Drive at 55th Street on the northern edge of Jackson Park, is housed in what was the Palace of Fine Arts during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, one of the grandest of all World's Fairs. What they usually miss, as reported by former Tribune travel writer Alan Solomon in his interesting ""Best Kept Secrets of Chicago"" article, is the one-third scale replica of Daniel Chester French's monumental sculpture, ""Statue of the Republic,"" honoring America on the 400th anniversary of Columbus' voyage. The original, which stood 65 feet tall, dominated the fair's basin but was destroyed in an 1896 fire. French's replica--covered in gold leaf like the original but 24 feet tall--was dedicated in Jackson Park at the corner of Hayes and Richards Drives. Unlike the plaster original, the replica is bronze. In case you haven't heard of Daniel Chester French, he crafted the famous Abraham Lincoln sculpture in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. As for Jackson Park, it is a 500-acre park on Chicago's South Side. located at 6401 South Stony Island in the Woodlawn community area. It extends into the South Shore and Hyde Park community areas, bordering Lake Michigan. It was named for President Andrew Jackson. It is part of a 1,055-acre tract of land that was created in 1869 and included Washington Park and the Midway Plaisance at the University of Chicago. In 1890, Chicago won the honor of hosting the World's Columbian Exposition and Jackson Park was selected as its site. Famed architects Frederick Law Olmstead and Daniel H. Burnham laid out the fairgrounds. A team of architects and sculptors created ""White City,"" a group of plaster buildings and artworks in Beaux-Arts style. The historic World's Fair opened on May 1, 1893. After it closed six months later, the site was transformed back into parkland. Jackson Park featured the first public golf course west of the Allegheny Mountains, opening in 1899. The Palace of Fine Arts, now the Museum of Science and Industry, is the only surviving structure. The only other relic from the fair still in the same location is The Osaka Garden, a Japanese strolling garden. It was reconstructed on its original site on the Wooded Island after being vandalized during World War II. By itself, the Wooded Island is considered one of ""150 great places in Illinois"" by the American Institute of Architects. During the summer, the 63rd Street beach and the adjacent Lake Michigan is a destination for beachgoers. Jackson Park is home to over two dozen species of birds. In recent years, the state and city have spent millions of dollars to revitalize the lagoons and Osaka gardens. The lagoons have become a very popular fishing spot. The Chicago Lakefront Trail, an 18-mile multi-use path that runs through Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park and Jackson Park, is popular with cyclists and joggers. And there is speculation that Jackson Park could be the future home of the Barack Obama Presidential Library.",Jackson Park,November 2014,50

Beautifully restored,Allen21096,"Long before it became the Copernicus Center, this was the Gateway Theatre, so walking in to the building was certainly nostalgic from the late 50's and 60's.  They have done a great job of updating and restoring it.  Now it is used for various festivals and local concerts.",Copernicus Center,October 2014,40
Unique with nice gardens and shelter,RitaLyC,I took my sons (age 8 and 10) to China Town for the first time and this was a must stop. The shelter is beautiful and the gardens are nice but the playground equipment needs some updating.   It offers some great views of Downtown. Also nice that you can hop on the Water Taxi and head to Michigan Ave. (which we did). It's worth a visit and a nice place to burn off some energy or relax after exploring China town. Also it's great to use the Water Taxi to avoid some traffic during busy festivals downtown.,Ping Tom Memorial Park,August 2013,40
Wonderful evening of fun and culture,Ladyownedbizniz,"Visiting Chicago? Look up The Den Theatre.  They offer some great cultural experiences, and have a full bar.  Enjoy a drink, and a play in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.  I went of Christmas, and had the fortune of seeing a hilarious play called the ""The Seafarer"".  The performance was outstanding.",The Den Theatre,December 2013,50
Fantastic Venue,just1backpack,There are 6 theaters located in this building. The comfortable and homey lobby has a bar serving up reasonably priced signature cocktails. We saw the production of Dead Accounts which had just the right balance of serious subject matter and comedic verse. Quite enjoyable. ,The Den Theatre,October 2014,40
"Friendly, great for boaters, not very close to downtown.",gdindy,"Great for boaters, excellent availability, nice amenities. Need a larger ship store and open earlier and stay open later for boaters. You will get neighborhood people walking around the marina area however you need a code to get down the docks and into the restrooms. During boat show security is good and taxi's are a little bit more accessible. However, on normal days taxi's are difficult to obtain, its close enough to get a cab but far enough to have many passing by looking for fares. Overall I recommend this marina and recommend using and downloading UBER on your cell phone. When you call for the Taxi service the marina gives you says they will send someone by, good luck. If you use UBER you will get an instant text message and can follow them moving in your direction on your phone, its amazing, and first time we used. Always nice cars and drivers speak good english. Overall great skyline view, take a bike if your boat can fit one or two so you can ride down lakeshore to Navy Pier but its about 5-7 miles.",31st Street Harbor,June 2013,40

A Quiet Secret in A Bustling City,ebunny2014,Ping Tom Memorial Park is a small park located literally over the tracks on the edge of Chinatown. This is a quiet park meant to be a respite for the local urbanites living nearby. It is in direct contrast to the rail tracks above and within the area. If you are looking for a nice quiet moment you can park and walk or you can take a water taxi which pulls up to a pagoda style awning within the park. If you are interested in more intimately exploring the river there is a kayak rental hut as well.,Ping Tom Memorial Park,September 2014,40

Got there an hour early and enjoyed the display in the lobby (only need 15minutes to do this). Doors opened 25 minutes before the show began. Seated in middle front area row E just behind the poncho section. Not a bad seat everything was very visible- if I were to do it again may look for a seat at H, I level instead just to give a better perspective on the show (E level was just below the level of the stage). Great show! Don't show up late! ",Briar Street Theatre,February 2015,40

Book a late Sunday flight,KwesiM,"I'm sure most cities has a flea market similar to this but now that I live outside of Chicago visiting this one was a bit special. Where I live there are not as many Latinos so the ethnic flavor of the market is different for me. We were craving authentic tomales in particular and found them at one of the booths. ""Mild"" sauce quickly sent my wife to the porta-potty but she survived and we enjoyed the food, the stroll and bought a few pretty inexpensive items. I am in Chicago often and usually fly out in the morning back to the east coast but now I have another reason to stay a bit longer. ",Maxwell Street Market,July 2016,40
Don't Bother,Toroniee T,We flew to Chicago for a long weekend vacation. Visited Maxwell Street Market during our first morning in Chicago. I feel like it was a waste of half an hour plus busing time.

"All Blue Man Group, all the time!",Jeremy D,"I've been to the Briar Street Theatre a few times in the past. As they are a Blue Man Group theater, that is all that they play. Blue Man Group itself is spectacular and at times astonishing (but in a good way). There is so much that the actors communicate, despite the fact that they never speak - issues with the modern world, solitude, interpersonal relations and the value of music. The tickets weren't that much, and I also saved money by parking in a wrigley lot with the park whizz app. As long as you are okay with performance art (and some audience participation), there is no reason why you wouldn't like Blue Man Group and the Briar Street Theatre.",Briar Street Theatre,October 2013,50

The beach is pretty clean, so we weren't afraid to get our toes in the sand. The water was freezing Memorial Day weekend, so didn't go more than ankle deep. The lifeguards were nice & welcoming. We arrived at noon & there were quite a few people arriving to set up barbeques & picnics.

I love this harbor but parking is an issue,O6378WFannag,View of downtown are spectacular. If you come here on Saturday or Sunday after 10am you won't find parking around.

"Great Show, Great Music, Great Fun",bjaschen,"On a side note, they need to figure out how to keep the bar open during the show.

This put me on edge for the rest of the day.  Also, be careful of some of the booths selling electronics.  There is no way to tell if any of this stuff is working or not, and I saw one man try to return something that didn't work, and the vendor swore to him it was working when he sold it.  A lot of yelling, cursing, etc. took place.",Maxwell Street Market,August 2013,30
Interesting Market for Sunday AM,Rijos,"This is very interesting sight for a big city. They close the street on Sunday AM and many different people come to sell stuff. It is a free, open flee market.

Maxwell Street market,Kevin B,"I imagine in it's time, the Maxwell Street market was a unique place for people to shop on certain weekends.  Now it is just a very run down experience in a very run down area.  Lots of vendors still, but almost all was cheap junk, trinkets and clothes, etc. that apparently fell off the truck.  The only good point, for me at least, was the variety of authentic Mexican food.

The drummer and lead vocalist , Jenny Rockis, takes you back to the sounds of Janis Joplin, among others.  The interior of the theatre  is beautiful and it is worth a visit.  The restrooms are well-maintained and there is a nice bar just off of the lobby.",Copernicus Center,July 2018,50
Historical Concert Hall with a Big Parking Problem,charlesthebarles,"This beautiful historic theater has functioned for several decades as Chicago's Polish Cultural Center when it's not leased out for independent performances. We went for a Chicago Philharmonic concert featuring the works of Polish composers in celebration of the old country's 100 years of independence. Architecture, lighting, and acoustics inside the atmospheric concert hall are EXCELLENT and you'll think you're in an old Roman or Greek temple with its arches, chandeliers, statues, artwork, and historical mementos. Also has a lobby bar/snack venue serving the thirsty, hungry crowd, although it needs many more workers to handle the long lines. Unfortunately management doesn't make the hall easy to patronize with problems ranging from online ticketing issues (their site only worked in 1 of our 3 browsers) and the nightmare parking. Although our concert advertised free parking, its small lot was full more than an hour before the performance and attendants would not help confused drivers looking for spaces except to tell people they'd get ticketed if they parked in the adjacent lots of a college, a bank, etc. whose lots otherwise sat completely empty. Why management can't strike deals with its neighbors to charge for parking--with both sides benefitting--would be better than making people find paid street parking blocks and blocks away.",Copernicus Center,November 2018,40
Lots of history in Jackson Park,Taylor B,"Jackson Park was first developed in 1893 as the host site for the World's Columbian Exposition, or the Chicago World's Fair. In a six-month period, it drew millions of people to the Chicago lakefront. Today, the event is memorialized by the Statue of the Republic, a replica 1/3 the size of the original, and the Museum of Science and Industry, the only surviving ""palace"" in the park from the World's Fair era, and a Japanese Garden. Jackson Park, located at 6401 South Stony Island Avenue in the Woodlawn community on Chicago's South Side, covers 542.89 acres and extends into the Hyde Park and South Shore neighborhoods. Bordering on Lake Michigan, it is named after Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States. The park, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, includes woodland trails, two walking trails, two basketball courts, playing fields, a beach, an 18-hole golf course and a boat harbor. It is the potential future site of the Barack Obama Presidential Center and Library. Connected to Washington Park by the University of Chicago's Midway Plaisance and to Grant Park by Burnham Park, Jackson Park is home to two dozen species of birds. The 63rd Street beach is a popular destination for sun-bathers. The golf course, which opened in 1900, was the first public golf course in the Midwest.",Jackson Park,September 2018,50
Statue of the Republic,richardmW3974WX,"Not easy to get to by CTA - about 35 minutes walk from Cottage Grove on the green line.  I think the statue is well worth the effort.

Unless you really love history...,AlexB10499,"If you’re a casual traveler who is staying in the Loop and doesn’t have major preferences about what you see in the city, I would actually say Jackson Park probably isn’t worth the trip. I made the half-hour bus ride down to the park because I’m a history buff, and Jackson Park is historically significant as the fairgrounds of the famed 1893 World’s Exhibition. While this was once the hub of international cultural exchange, today there really isn’t anything there in the park itself to do besides stroll around. Local habitat restoration is underway, particularly on the Wooded Island (which I walked around on), and while it’s important to have good habitat in an urban area, it makes the park look unkempt and neglected. Finally, the South Side of Chicago does have a bad reputation, and as a solo traveler there were a couple times I walked by people sitting on benches in shaded areas and felt a little uneasy. If you do decide to see the park, bring a friend and definitely visit in daylight, and be sure to see the Palace of Fine Arts Building and the Japanese Garden, the only two extant relics of the World’s Fair. You can have a perfectly fulfilling visit to Chicago without seeing Jackson Park, though.",Jackson Park,September 2019,30
WOW WHAT A PLACE TO VISIT!,route66april,The girls I think were called Anna and Samantha (our apologies if we got your names wrong) gave us a great insight into Mr Klairmont and his achievements.  Would have loved to have met the man!,Klairmont Kollections,August 2018,50
You must visit,Buick1_36758,"They recently opened this up to the general public a couple of days a week.  While the price is not cheap (around $22 for adults), it is absolutely worth going.  They have a lot of very nice cars and there are some interesting stories along with each one of them.  The car memorabilia is also outstanding as well.  I spent 4-5 hours there because I read about each car.  So, I would recommend getting there early in the day.",Klairmont Kollections,January 2019,50
FABULOUS AND WELL WORTH THE VISIT EVEN IF YOUR NOT A CAR NUT,Debbie O,"We tend to go on holidays and take hundreds of photos and end up deleting many of them in a massive cull when we get home. I'm far from a car nut however, I managed to take a lot of photos and deleted 0 when I got home. We thought we would spend a couple of hours at the max and yet 4-5 hrs later we left. If you want to read all about the cars, you can.  If your not into reading, there is so much to just wander and look at even an old Route 66 type garage. There are bikes, motor bikes, cars from movies and so much more. Thank you to Mr Klairmont and his lovely wife for opening this collection up to the public. Best car display I've ever been to.

The building is beautiful and the bar was very cool, but very expensive and filled with young millennials who seem to have a lot more $$ to spend in a cool place than a couple of Baby Boomers like us. The Bloody Mary was $18.00-yes, very pricey. However the service was excellent and the waitress very friendly.

Not worth going if vacationing in Chicago,KrisFarley,"If you are visiting/vacationing in Chicago, this is not going to be worth your time visiting!   We took a train out near this location on 10/6/2019 and walked to the market.   The area does not appear to be a safe area to be walking in (missing car tires, many homeless people).  When we go tot he market it was all second hand items, flea market style set up, and just mostly junk that majority of tourists wouldn't want to buy nor have room to carry in their luggage.   Just my opinion though, it might be a better option for those that actually live here?   If you are vacationing, there are PLENTY of other places that you can go see that would be way better than this place.  Hope this review helps!",Maxwell Street Market,October 2019,10

Being concerned it may be closed for the season I called ahead that Friday (9/8) and was assured it was open Sat and Sunday and told in fact it was the last weekend of the season.   Great we made plans to meet people there Saturday.   When we arrived the pool gate was chained shut, the water was already green and a sign on the gate clearly stated Memorial Day - Labor Day.

Our one complaint would be when we parked in the parking garage, it stated weekdays $8, weekends/holidays $25, cash or credit. There was zero notice to us the machines were cash only to get out of the garage, & made it quite a pain for work through that. They need to have this situation corrected.

Hidden Gem in the heart of Lincoln Park,K9947GDbrianm,We took our kids to see The Magic Cabaret. The show was great and we'll probably be back to see it again and others. The staff at the theater were friendly and helpful. They have a nice little theater bookstore upstairs. Our show was in the upstairs theater which was a great intimate space for an up close and spectacular magic show. Great places to eat in the neighborhood and several offer discounts with your tickets. Parking was in a garage a few short blocks away and we used a parking app to get discounted parking. We had a perfect night and we'll definitely be back! Just plan ahead and take city traffic into consideration so you make it on time.

An excellent performance without a bad seat to be had anywhere it seemed to us - although they did say the theatre has a few partially blocked seats. Let me first say that the company did an amazing job with a tough piece. Great work. We had the time to explore the theatre and it offers a range of plays simultaneously at times. When we concluded we were advised another space was having a performance. A book store and a bar with seating helped while waiting for the house to open and the staff were helpful.

After that we were brought to the taproom where we drank as much as we could for about an hour, think of this as having a bar to yourself for an hour and not having to pay.

"The Lincoln Statue, always larger than life",Taylor B,"For years, ever since my wife and I moved to a condominium building overlooking Lincoln Park on Chicago's Gold Coast, we have had a magnificent view of Abraham Lincoln: The Man, also called Standing Lincoln, the larger-than-life size, 12-foot-tall bronze statue of the 16th president of the United States that stands in Lincoln Park, off North Stockton Drive, behind the Chicago History Museum. Completed in 1887 by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, it has been described as the most important sculpture of Lincoln from the 19th century. It is the original statue of Lincoln that Saint-Gaudens created. Several replicas have been installed in other places around the world, including Lincoln's Tomb in Springfield, Illinois, London and Mexico City. Curiously, one stands in Bunker Hill, Illinois, a small farming community near St. Louis. The sculpture depicts a contemplative Lincoln rising from a chair, about to give a speech. It is set upon a pedestal and, in Chicago, an exedra or semicircular platform with a bench designed by noted architect Sanford White. Chicago businessman Eli Bates provided $40,000 in his will to pay for the statue and Saint-Gaudens was specially selected for the commission after a design competition failed to produce a winning artist. It was accorded landmark status by the City of Chicago in 2001.",Lincoln Monument,April 2019,50

The original, completed in 1887 by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, has been described as the most important sculpture of Lincoln from the 19th century.

It is set upon a pedestal and, in Chicago, is framed by an exedra or semicircular platform with a bench designed by noted architect Stanford White. In 2001, the city of Chicago awarded the monument landmark status.",Lincoln Monument,December 2019,50
Plenty to see and do walking Clark Street in downtown Chicago,Ibs24,"Clark Street is a very well known and traveled stretch of downtown Chicago. There are options of all kinds from viewing the amazing Chicago skyline, to accessing the River Walk areas to having to choose from a variety of cuisines and eating venues. Deep dish Chicago pizza parlors are abundant as are the well known chain establishments...but the best bet is to try one of the local eateries. Ask around and the friendly Chicago folks will provide all kinds of options.  ",Clark Street,August 2017,50

Picasso at the Lapin Agile Is a Bad Play that Is Performed Well by the Organic Theater Company,Janet H,"In June 2015, I went to the Greenhouse Theater Center with my brothers and sisters to see Picasso at the Lapin Agile performed by the Organic Theater Company.  This comedy by Steve Martin gets attention because it includes characters like Picasso, Albert Einstein, and Elvis Presley.  However, the play is not really very funny, and Martin does not develop the characters in an interesting way.  The actors of the Organic Theater Company are very good and make the show lively.  But they cannot overcome the handicap of working with a poorly written drama.  I hope that the staff will choose a better play in the future.",Greenhouse Theater Center,June 2015,40
Churchill,travelingdoc42,"This  was  a  very entertaining one man  show which  covered  most  of  Churchill’s  active  life.  The  historian  in our  group said  it  was  accurate  and  the  actor  did  a  great  job  of   projecting  Churchill’s  voice, tone  &  mannerisms. The  theater  was  one  of  these  ¾ round  theaters  that  seem  so common in  the  smaller, local  theaters  in the  Chicago  area. It  looked  like  it  could  seat  about  200, but  was  set up for  about  half  that  for  this  performance. It  was  one  of  several small theaters  in the  same  building complex, and  another  show  was  going  on  at the  same  time  as  this one…necessitating  being  quiet  at  intermission. Our  theater  was  on  the  second  floor, but  there  was at least  one  more  on the  first  floor. We highly recommend this production.",Greenhouse Theater Center,July 2015,50

From Graceland to Riverdale,Taylor B,"With the exception of Michigan Avenue and State Street, Clark Street may be the most significant street in Chicago with its number of historical sites and tourist attractions. Or maybe it's just because it runs through my neighborhood. By bus, it is the fastest route between Wrigley Field and City Hall. Hundreds of years ago, Clark Street was the shoreline of Lake Michigan. Today, it borders Lincoln Park. It is a north-south street that runs from the northern city boundary with Evanston to Cermak Road and to Riverdale beyond 127th Street across the Calumet River to the South. The major length of Clark Street runs a total of 98 city blocks, not as long as nearby Western Avenue. Named for George Rogers Clark, an American Revolutionary War soldier who captured much of the Northwest Territory from the British, north of the Loop it roughly follows part of the path of an Indian trail called Green Bay trail that ran all the way to Green Bay, Wisconsin. Clark Street passes through the Andersonville neighborhood, historic Graceland Cemetery, Metro Concert Hall, Wrigley Field, the site of the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, Chicago History Museum, Wieners Circle Hot Dog Stand, Germania Club building, Newberry Library, Washington Park, Clark Street Bridge, the Thompson Center, City Hall and the Daley Center.",Clark Street,September 2018,50

St Valentines Day Massacre Site.....All gone!,Chad B,Im surprised that none of the reviews mention that  2122 North Clark Street was the site of the St Valentines Day Massacre. I guess its easy to overlook because there is no longer any sign or mentioning of this tragic event. All there is now is a parking lot and grass lawn. For the life of me I dont know why there isn't even a small plaque of this event but I guess Chicago doesn't need any reminders of how violent their past was and still is.,Clark Street,April 2019,20

A miniature display unlike any other,Taylor B,"My wife and I have browsed the Thorne Miniature Rooms at the Art Institute of Chicago on previous occasions. But after seeing the display of the Thorne collection at the Phoenix Art Museum during our recent two-week vacation in Arizona, we decided to make another visit to larger Thorne collection in Chicago. It is an exhibit unlike any other, a child's dream. Thorne Miniature Rooms are a set of about 100 miniature models of rooms created between 1932 and 1940 under the direction of Narcissa Niblack Thorne, who was born in 1882 in Vincennes, Indiana. As a child, she began to collect miniature furniture and household accessories. Her uncle, a U.S. Navy vice admiral, sent her many antique dollhouse miniatures from around the world. When she was 19, she married Montgomery Ward department store heir James Ward Thorne, whose fortune helped to finance her hobby. Ninety-nine of the rooms are still believed to be in existence. The majority of them, a total of 68, are on display at the Art Institute of Chicago, located at 111 South Michigan Avenue. We saw 20 of them at the Phoenix Art Museum. The Art Institute's rooms document European and American interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s and the 17th century to the 1930s, respectively. Constructed on a 1:12 scale, the rooms are largely made of the same materials as full-sized rooms and some even include original works of art, including paintings and sculpture, silver bowls and crystal chandeliers. They are among the most popular attractions at the Art Institute with an authentic appearance and attention to detail that boggles the mind.",Thorne Miniature Rooms,November 2019,50

Architecture and the Money Museum,Steve5863,"The financial district is located in the Chicago Loop and is centered on LaSalle St with the best part from Adams St to its end at the Chicago Board of Trade at Jackson Blvd.  The two best attractions for visitors is seeing the architecture in these last two blocks, especially at dusk when the mixed artificial and natural light make the imposing facades all the more imposing, and the Money Museum at the Chicago Federal reserve.  Architecturally, the art deco CBOT is the most impressive building in my option and the Money Museum is only open when the Federal Reserve is open.  Since the ""Fed"" keeps bankers' hours, it can be challenging to see the museum with school aged children.",Financial District,February 2013,40

The 1st floor was divided up into 6 topical areas by room. It was wonderful to see Chicagoans consuming books.

Excellent gallery,DiDC09,"Tadao Ando is undoubetdly a great architect whose long career is surely enhanced by this impressive and pleasing space.  The gallery’s reclusive patron lives in an older Ando designed much shorter house next door and years ago bought the apartment building that now houses the gallery, as the story goes, to empty it of tenants for privacy.   Ando, a master of light and shadow using meticulously poured concrete, here inserted that concrete structure behind the original brick facade of the century old former apartment building.  You could call it facadectomy, but that derisive moniker doesn’t seem to fit this significant work of contemporary architecture.  The old building was sacrificed but the new byulding is beautifully wrought, reusing reclaimed Chicago brick on the inside front wall, cleverly holding the mortar back 3/4” from the face of the brick creating depth nd shadow in an inexpected way.  The new space functions beautifully as a gallery, the new windows and skylights providing kist the right natural light. The new millwork is also beautiful, the wide stairs to the penthouse doubling as stage or seating with the level below.

It is a small theater making the show an intimate experience where you feel that the play us unfolding in your living room.  I think actors have to work extra hard when they are up close and personal, with few props - they have to carry the whole story and they did a great job.  The story was fun and hopeful. The theater itself if comfy, cozy seats and any of them would be a ""good"" seat.  The bar and lounge area up front is sleek and modern. The fireplace has a whimsical touch.  It's friendly and warm and perfect for a cocktail.  There are a few places nearby with some decent pub grub so you can have 'dinner and a show' with one free parking spot!  Affordable.

"""A landmark of architectural history""",Taylor B,"What is the old saying: ""You can't see the forest for the trees."" I thought of that the other day after we toured the historic Charnley-Persky House at 1365 North Astor Street in Chicago's Gold Coast. We have lived only two blocks from the house for more than 30 years and walked past it and marveled at its exterior on many occasions. But, for unexplained reasons, we never found the time to arrange a tour until recently. Oh, what we missed. The James Charnley residence was completed in 1892 for Charnley, a Chicago lumberman who lived in the house with his family for about a decade. The building was later owned by members of the Waller family, who invested in real estate. In 1986, the house was purchased and restored by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. In 1994, Seymour Persky purchased the house and donated it to the Society of Architectural HIstorians, which operates it as a museum and organization headquarters. An Adler and Sullivan design, the townhouse is the work of Louis Sullivan and a young Frank Lloyd Wright, who was a junior draftsman in Sullivan's office at the time. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998. To say the plain brick facade with simple ornamentation is quite different from other houses in the Gold Coast is putting it mildly. But the interior is distinguished by rich ornamentation that is typical of Sullivan's work. The house is one of the few major residential commissions realized by Sullivan, is a benchmark in the early development of Wright and is the only surviving example of a design to which both Sullivan and Wright made substantial contributions. The house is composed horizontally. An ashlar gray limestone base extends over the raised basement to the sill line of the main floor. Course of yellow Roman brick extend from that base to the roofline. A projecting wooden balcony sits in the recessed center bay of the second and third floors. An addition was constructed on the south side of the house in 1927. Decorative elements throughout the interior reflect work characteristic of Sullivan. Oak panels sheath the entrance foyer, leading into a light-filled hall that rises to the skylight roof. Quartersawn oak is used in most of the primary spaces, including floors and stairways. It is interesting how the two most famous American architects, each with his own design philosophies, came together to reject the historically-inspired details commonly used during the Victorian era and, by incorporating more abstract ornamentation and forms, pointed the way toward a new era in architectural design. Group tours of the exterior and interior of the house last about an hour.",Charnley-Persky House,November 2015,50

A great institution at 125 years!,Art169,"The Newberry Library, 60 West Walton Street, Chicago, IL, 60610, is one of the world's great research libraries and museums of books and manuscripts, the history of western culture since the Renaissance.

I went to see The Nutcracker just after Christmas (Dec. 2014), which is not my favorite ballet but it is a winter tradition.  I was not as amazed by the Joffrey Ballet as I thought I would be; I guess I had high expectations due to how the company is projected in the media and dance-world.  I also expected a lot because Fabrice Calmels was performing the male lead.  Calmel's leaps left much to be wanting; I expected longer, higher leaps, although, he turns were fantastic.  Kara Zimmerson, who played the Sugar Plum Fairy, was not ""on"" this particular evening, and I understand as I dancer we can't always be ""on"" but...I felt that there was an overall lack of energy from most of the company.  Clara's choreography was quite simplistic; I am accustomed to seeing more from this role, so I was a bit disappointment that Clara did not dance more challenging sequences.  But! the Land of Snow was very impressive; the dancers, lead by Jaiani and Suluashvili, were in sync and very precise yet they exuded such grace.  The stage is small compared to most professional stages, but the production crew did a phenomenal job with the set and props - the growth of the tree and its flickering candles was impressive and the final send off for Clara was quite special and unique (I'll keep this part a secret in case someone has not yet seen the Joffrey's version yet!).  Overall for the price of my ticket and the performance I saw, I was let down.  In the future, I may return to see another performance, but probably only if someone else buys the ticket for me.",Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2014,30
NEW WORKS PERFORMANCE,Henry D,Wow!! We loved this performance at our first visit to the Cadillac Palace theatre on West Randolph. What a gorgeous theatre and what an exhilirating performance!!! Bravo!!!,Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,April 2015,50

One of the best flea/antique markets I've ever been to,cmm218,"I love flea markets. Whenever I travel to a big city, I love to check out markets. I got hooked on them when traveling to Paris (where they have the creme de la creme of flea and street markets). I've done Hell's Kitchen in NYC and various other ones around the world. I've seen lots of bad ones. Randolph Street Market is one of my favorites and I'm so glad its in my city!!There is a small entry fee ($8 if you buy online) - small price to pay for a great experience. The market takes places mostly in the summer and early fall. Last weekend of every month basically. It takes place in a large building and in the parking lot outside. What I love about this market it is that it is NICE. Vendors take care to present their wares nicely, not just thrown out in boxes. There is something for every budget. Everything from costume jewelry and knick knacks to high end vintage refurbished furniture.  There is also a significant crafts and home made portion, where you can find some really nice items. There are many local food vendors there as well. Just a great way to spend an afternoon! I go multiple times a year. Street parking isn't too bad to find if you go early, at 10 AM.",Randolph Street Market,August 2012,50
"Wonderful cultural asset, a real treasure!",BunclodySenator,"A friend took me to see a collection of marbled papers, the gift of a mutual friend, and also partially her own life's work. The Newberry Library is a repository for books, but also book-related items, and very welcoming to the general community. I saw numerous younger people and elderly accessing the facility, and all with admirable behavior.",Newberry Library,June 2011,50
Newberry Library,Sue K,"THE place to go for the serious genealogist.  Wonderful collection of old books, census info, maps, town histories, family histories, etc.  Helpful libarians.  Particularly strong collection of New England genealogy material.  Parking is in nearby public garages.  Beautiful old building.",Newberry Library,June 2011,50
Funky market,Janet G,"I expected it to be a huge open-air market, like the Porta Portese in Rome. Instead, it was remarkably compact. I liked the variety--music, food, antiques, clothes, collectibles, art, a little bit of everything. If I had had a truck, I would not have passed on the wood and iron industrial themed furniture. Some beautiful stuff. The free trolley from Watertower Pumping Station (20-30 min.) was a plus. Stops right in front of the Visitors Center off Michigan.",Randolph Street Market,July 2013,40
A little bit of everything,candicef14,"The Randolph Street Market is huge! There are so many unique items. There is a wide variety of food. There are a number of great restaurants just down the street. You could easily spend all day at the Market and night at the great restaurants. We took the train and walked, but there did appear to be plenty of parking on the street. I definitely plan on returning!",Randolph Street Market,July 2013,50
Worth a trip for whatever they have available,GoHere,Great group of folks work here.  Worth a trip on L from downtown.  TheTap Room is a great addition to this local establishment.,Half Acre Beer Company,January 2013,50
Add this to your list of things to do in Chicago,fdr0208,"If you like beer, and you must like beer if you are even considering going here, then I highly recommend Half Acre.  Chicago has a lot of good options for craft beer, but Half Acre is really special.  Small batches, great brews, especially IPA's...such a fun way to spend a day at this tap room.  The beer is brewed by a team clearly passionate about their brews and having fun while doing it.  We sampled all of the beers on tap during our recent trip to Chicago.  It was awesome to head out of the city and experience a true, local, neighborhood establishment.  We met wonderful people while there - the tables are community tables and board games are offered to play as you sip away.  The neighborhood is really cute, a quieter part of Chicago, but worth heading out of the main drag in Chicago to experience a true gem.  Talk to the people at the tap room and store next door - they know their stuff, they love it and you will learn so much about beer when you are there!  Further, they are all local to Chicago now, so they have great recommendations for other places to enjoy while in town.  I picked up some hot sauces they sell at their shop & tried them when I got home - delicious!  They don't make the hot sauce, but they sell some great little gifts and items in addition to beer which highlights their focus on community.  Lots of respect for these talented brewers - head out to their tap room - you will not be disappointed!  They don't serve food, but you can bring sandwiches in, which we saw some people doing & looked fun!  it gets busy here, as anyone in the know understands what a gem this tap room is, but as I said, talk with those around you & meet new people & have fun!",Half Acre Beer Company,June 2013,50
It's Not a Museum - Buy it Now!,quietlycool,"We traveled from the northern suburbs specifically to check out this market and we were not disappointed.  Not sure what to expect in size, value, charm, etc., we were happily surprised.  We enjoy kickin' around local flea markets so ventured down to see what we could find.  A little of everything from food, herbs, vintage, vinyl records, 8-track tapes, marshmallows, signs, large metal/glass letters, furniture, glassware, you name it, they had it!  (and that list doesn't include what they have inside - including air conditioning!)  Add live music, craft beers, food vendors and WXRT to a lively crowd, and voila...an enjoyable time had by all!  If you see, and like it, buy it!  We went back to a booth about 30 minutes after seeing an old tri-fold mirror for a vanity and it was gone, baby, gone!  So, go, baby, go... and Enjoy!",Randolph Street Market,May 2014,40
Excellent way to spend a few hours,LindyGirl63,"We went to the Randolph Street Market over Memorial Day weekend and had a great time. There were a ton of vendors, some really great food and excellent music. Well worth the cost to get in, and not that crowded. We planned on staying about 2 hours, stayed about 3and a half, and hated ourselves for not planning for more time!",Randolph Street Market,May 2014,50
Best Nutcracker!!!,ElizabethN333,"Over the years I've seen many performances of Nutcracker but this was by far the best.  While there were children in appropriate parts, all the main parts were performed by professional adult dancers, something I appreciate.  The story was well staged and performed, and it was more gripping than usual due to the high level of skill.  I would see this again in a heartbeat!  I also loved seeing all the little girls in their pretty dresses in the audience, and even the one little cutie dancing in the isle during the performance.",Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2014,50
Wow. Just wow. ,Pixycon,"We took our girls, ages 15 and 12, to see The Nutcracker for a pre-Christmas Christmas present. We all enjoyed it, even the 12 year old who was skeptical when we told her the plan for the weekend. I personally was enraptured and could not believe how quickly the time passed. I highly recommend seeing the Joffrey Ballet, only wish we hadn't missed Swan Lake this summer!",Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2014,50
The Nutcracker is Exquisite,Chicagotravelgirl111,We just took our two boys (ages 7 and 5) to see the Nutcracker at the Auditorium Theater.  The theater is gorgeous.  We bought tickets in row W and it gave us a perfect view.  The theater even had cushions for the kids to use to sit up higher.  The music and dancing were awesome.  The show held the kids' attention the entire time.  I highly recommend seeing the Joffrey Ballet if you are in Chicago!!,Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2014,50
Nutcracker 2014 had great talent and creativity,Norsketech,"This was my first time seeing Joffery's rendition.  I was impressed with the dancer's skill and poise.  Many times I caught myself thinking they were actually slowing down the music, but it wasn't so.  The dance was just so smooth and graceful it created a grand allusion that was very enjoyable.",Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2014,50
Lovely Ballet and Great Orchestra Music,offthebeatenpath100,"Enjoyed the beautifully quaint, old but well kept theater.  Seats were not top priced, but had a great view and looked like almost every seat in the house would be very acceptable.  The ballet was beautiful as expected.  The live orchestra music amazingly well done.  Highly recommend and worth the price of a ticket especially if you like the ballet, but would be a wonderful choice if you're new to ballet and want to try it out.

Little bit of everything,Laura S,"Used a groupon for discount admission, totally worth it, easy entry. We first visited the food stand area and got AMAZING Dinky Donuts. Totally 100% stop at their booth. Then we walked around the outside vendors, totally fabulous collection of every style possible. You've got hand picked antiques, refurbished antiques, knick knacks, jewelry from antique to new, clothing from every era, and really great re-purposed building materials. I would have bought more if I only knew where to put it in my house! If I find myself in Chicago during their market weekend again, I will be back.",Randolph Street Market,July 2015,50
Cool place for a night out,NikosHourvou,"Visited at night, Randolph street has hundreds of locals and visitors. Dozens of choices to eat or have a drink. Most places however need a reservation.

Beautiful and suggestive library,rei_kashino,I liked this library because it was the main setting of The Time Travellers' Wife novel. A bit disappointing though as I wanted to have a silent wander around and they told me it wasn't possible unless I was there to consult books. Understandable but...,Newberry Library,July 2014,40
One of a kind library,dvkremk,The Newberry Library is a treasure in our neighborhood.  It opened in 1893. It is a beautiful building.  Free tours are available on Thursdays at 3 and Saturdays at 10:30.  They also have exhibits that change every few months that are free when the library is open.  Additionally they have programs and events that are free or have a fee.  Check their website.  Their emphasis is research and reference with emphasis on genealogy and maps.  ,Newberry Library,July 2014,50

New production of Prokofiev's Romeo & Juliet very avant grade but hits the mark,Orso52,"Our daughter and her fiancé got us gift tickets for the Auditorium Theater to the closing performance of this new interpretation of a 20th century classic.  In fact, we've seen other versions of Romeo & Juliet performed by the Joffrey at the Auditorium.  This one shines for its originality; but, you really do need to be well familiar with Shakespeare's original stage play to be able to interpret what's happening on stage.  Our seats in the lower level boxes on the left side of the theater gave us an unobstructed view.  ",Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,May 2014,40

The other half of the family one slept and the others were bored and cranky. so know your crowd.,Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2013,40
Swan Lake,367markk,Magnificent performance!  The dancers were smooth as silk.  The orchestra was wonderful as well.   I will definitely come back again.  The Auditorium Theatre is a nice venue for ballet. It is worth the extra money to get seating near the front by the orchestra to best appreciate the dancers.,Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2013,50
Not what it used to be,Jeremy B,"Had a mixed experience when I visited the August 2016 show.  This show is known for midcentury modern, vintage industrial, vintage clothes and accessories, and some repurposed items.  It has a younger crowd than most antique shows, many twenty and thirty something's.  The problem is less vintage and more other stuff.  About 25% of the show is no longer vintage.  There was even a car dealer there.  Also many of the dealers were low on stock.  Perhaps time of the year?  It's a hour drive for me, so no longer worth the trip.",Randolph Street Market,August 2016,30
treasure hunters and browsers smile,worlds2wanderer,"So many wanderers this Sunday at the indoor and outdoor market. Great range of prices and items for sale. Live bands played all day and seating was available in the sun or shade to enjoy a snack and listen while people watching. Like any of the markets I've been to around Chicago, Washington DC, Amsterdam, Oslo, Copenhagen, Paris, San Francisco and Nashville you can be a happy wanderer finding unexpected treasures and ideas for your next personal redo or grumpy because they didn't have the one thing you wanted for the price you wanted to pay. Seize the beauty of the hunt, compliment the vedors on what you like and bargain reasonably. This trip I especially enjoyed the great selection of original posters; reprints of lots of Chicago magazine covers and old travel posters and maps; tons of jewelry-- vintage, handmade, sterling and more: and several reclaimed wood and rough cut wood benches, tables, frames; window framed signs, cutting boards and bowls booths.",Randolph Street Market,August 2016,50

Magic at the Auditorium,btracymadison,"The Joffrey's final performance of the season was literally magical–laughing and crying at the beauty of it all all at the same time. Planning on Giselle for certain for next season; and the Auditorium Theatre directly across from Grant Park, the Joffrey's home performance venue and part of Roosevelt University, is an historic stunner designed by iconic Chicago architect Louis Sullivan. It is remains much much more comfortable than the current Civic Opera House and currently home of the Lyric Opera of Chicago. There is not one single comfortable seat in any part of the the COH on Wacker, except perhaps one of the boxes which is the only area in this visually sumptuous but ridiculously uncomfortable space we haven't tried.",Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,May 2017,50
Giselle a High Caliber Execution of a Classic!,Carl_CC_Rider,"""Giselle"" is a classic ballet, and the Joffrey did a flawless, fantastic rendition.  The set decoration was terrific!  This show really showcased classical ballet as well as demonstrating the highest dance skills to execute at the highest level.  It was also nice to see some other members of the Joffrey get a chance to step into leading roles.  The Auditorium theater seems to have gotten a bit of a sprucing up as well.  We will continue to be season ticket holders!",Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,October 2017,50

The trip was a result of seeing the Diagalove and the Ballet Russe exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in DC. What a treat. The Auditorium where the Joffrey performs is an attraction itself. The tiles, frescos, lighting and seats are just beautiful. The Joffrey orchestra is the Chicago Philharmonic! It's a WOW. And dancers themselves were magnificent.

Amazing.  Received a standing ovation, even though it was only halfway through the night.  Both dancers were phenomenal, truly physics-defying.

20$ entrance fee?,Veroagui,Both of my sons are into flea market hunting everywhere we travel but this is not only the poorest we’ve attended. We were actually surprised to be charged an entry fee of 10 usds per person.  We are not used to be charged to enter a flea market. We didn’t find anything since it is actually pretty small and indoors (check its calendar on site) since I hope it is different experience in summer. Just a waste of time for us. Our 7 usd record actually cost us 40 usd considering cab ride cost+ entrance fee. Wouldn’t recommend it at all ...maybe only locals. ,Randolph Street Market,March 2018,10

The ballet is superb - the ambiance, the dancing, the musicianship, the......art!  You can buy seats as low as 35$ that are still wonderful seats, as the Auditorium Theater is smaller than other Chicago Theaters.  I would highly recommend this activity.  There is the bus/train/metra, or you can park.  See the Internet for details on where to park and for parking coupons (Joffrey will also send this information to you in email form before the event.

We were particularly taken with the student exhibits because Intuit reaches out into the community to promote art.  Intuit will take about a hour of time -- perhaps two if you include the transport to and fro (Chicago station on the Blue line).  Well worth the time for the unusual and the lifting of the spirit.",Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art,June 2016,50

Very interesting to see the Louis Sullivan details and the start of Frank Lloyd Wright's ideas on open planning. Easy to book on line and perhaps better on a Saturday when the office staff are absent (Wednesday is free though). Remember that access is not the front door, it's the gate on the right hand side.

Xmas Eve Viewing ,LC0717,After years of always wanting to see the nutcracker we finally decided to go with family this year on Christmas Eve. The show was spectacular and I couldn’t take my eyes off of the performers. The show was well done and seemed to go fairly quickly! I highly recommend seeing the show if you haven’t already. ,Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2017,50
"Bravo, Magnifico",Mari M,"New and mesmerizing performance of the Nutcracker that all Chicagoans should enjoy.  I loved the World's Fair theme.  Instead of a rich child in Czarist Russia receiving a nutcracker on Xmas Eve and dreaming of more, a poor boy from the south side steals one, I think, from the Impresario.  Buffalo Bill's roping, rodeo ballet was outstanding, amazing, magnifico.  I loved the exquisite snowflake dance just as much.  I must confess though to finding the tryst between the boys Mama and the Impresario, a little, dare I say it, Harvey Weinsteinish.  The sets, costumes and lighting were fantastic.  An absolute must see.",Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,December 2017,50

New Nutcracker was charming and great way to present Chicago to visitors,Robert J,"We visited Chicago just before Christmas and wanted to take in a show.  My wife is a ballet fan and wanted to see the Joffrey Ballet, but they were doing the Nutcracker as most ballet companies do at Christmas, to the point where it is rather worn out.  We were hesitant, but then read that the Joffrey is doing a new version, completely rewritten with a Chicago theme.  This was intriguing, though possibly this would prove kitschy.  Well, we went, and we thoroughly enjoyed the show.  It was great fun seeing how they adapted so many ideas from the original to their new setting of Maria at the Chicago World's Fair.  I won't ruin the surprise for you, but Buffalo Bill caught us by surprise and brought down the house.  We loved the show, the hall was beautiful, and we are so glad that we got to go.

Don't Miss Southern Gothic,Betsy H,This was our first immersive theater experience and we loved it.  You feel like you're eavesdropping on the characters who are actually attending a 40th birthday party.  You can follow characters or a particular plot line by walking around the house or you can sit for a while and watch things unfold.  The acting and directing are both superb.  The playhouse itself is warm and charming and friendly.  Street parking is nearby.,Windy City Playhouse,March 2018,50
Very fun and very different,Marc A,"I have never experienced immersive theater and I was more than a bit apprehensive. But this was really fun. The actors will not interact with you -- they look right past you although I was standing in the way of one and she actually said excuse me -- and they have staff there to guide you -- one directed me to move which I realized why a few minutes later when the actors moved to that space. This play -- Southern Gothic -- takes place in a house in 1961 Atlanta -- and you do really feel that you are in their house -- during a birthday party. They have snacks out that you can eat and the staff come by occasionally to serve whiskey showers, champaign, and tom collins. It is intense but beautifully acted. We definitely will come back for more! One suggestion -- do not sit during the play. You'll miss too much. Walk around and hear the different conversations. When have you had a chance to be a fly on a wall at someone's party!",Windy City Playhouse,March 2018,50
really good evening of theater,Robert A,"This is probably a unique theater experience.  you are seated in a small southern house and the play takes place around you in 3 rooms and patio.  You cannot possibly hear all the dialogue but it is so well written that you never really lose the plot line, which is not that important, it is essentially a melodrama with 4 couples who have known each other for a long time and who all have pasts, it is the themes that are really important and you can follow them easily.  The acting is really good, the direction is great, not really sure how they can imagine to direct this, but I am not a director, but can see it well done here, there is a lot of movement so maybe choreography is a better idea of how it moves.  the theater is small, and easy to get to really so do not be put off by distance from downtown, is is well worth the trip  Guys you all did a really great job",Windy City Playhouse,May 2018,50

It is a smaller theatre and because the tickets are less, they work on low budget. Although they still do a very good job on performance and their use of props so low budget really is not an issue, once it starts you get sucked in the story and forget where you are anyway!

"Biograph Theatre: Go For the History, Don't Stay For the Present",Brianlion57,"Drove to Chicago for a Cubs game, and we decided to stop off at the historic Biograph because of the John Dillinger connection.  We enjoyed walking around the area and soaking in the history.  When we went inside the lobby though, we were treated pretty shabbily by some who apparently thought they were more important than they actually were.  One lady running around  told us there was nothing in the theatre to see, and a fat guy sitting at a table asked, ""what does this guy want?"".  I explained what they should have already realized, that we were history buffs, and the Biograph was on our list of places to see. The lady-whoever she was, suggested we look around outside for anything historic.  So much for reveling and honoring their history.  What they do niot realize is that if Dillinger had not been shot there by the G-men, no one outside the area would have ever heard of the Biograph",Biograph Theatre,May 2013,10
Not Inside Review; Outside as a Gangster Hit.,worldtravelier,"This review is not what is inside but what occurred in front in the roaring twenties. As part of a gangster tour, this was a stop that described how Dillinger was gunned down with tommy guns by federal agents while he was leaving this theatre.

Then our paid ticket wouldn’t work when we tried to exit because too much time had lapsed between the time we paid and the time we tried to exit.  We ended up holding up a line of cars behind us trying to get out.  Instead of an apology, the people that worked there were actually quite rude about it.

The service was good, although it was very hot out (low 80s in early May), but the a/c didn't seem to be on at all.  That's fine if you have some sort of air flow, but it was a little stuffy in there.  We went next door and grabbed some beer to go.

Have you seen the Newberry's $12.7 million makeover?,Taylor B,"The Newberry Library, Chicago's most famous independent research institution, specializing in the humanities, is located at 60 West Walton Street, across from Washington Square or historic Bughouse Square, and has been free and open to the public since its opening in 1887. Its collections encompass a variety of topics related to the history and cultural production of Western Europe and the Americas over the last six centuries. Named to honor the founding bequest from the estate of philanthropist Walter Loomis Newberry, the library supports research with maps, travel, exploration, music from the Renaissance to the early 20th century, early contact between Western colonizers and Indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere, the personal papers of 20th century American journalists, the history of printing and genealogy and local history. It houses more than 1.5 million books, 5 million manuscript pages and 500,000 historic maps. The Newberry's Modern Manuscript Collection includes works by the late Chicago journalist Mike Royko, Ben Hecht, Sherwood Anderson, Fanny Butcher, John T. McCutcheon, Elmo Scott Watson, Floyd Dell and Malcolm Cowley. Among its most notable collection items are a Shakespeare First Folio, correspondence from Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, copies of the Federalist papers, Oswald Cooper's sketches for the Cooper Black typeface, original woodblocks made by Thomas Bewick, a fur trade contract from 1692 containing one of the earliest references to ""Chicagou,"" and the oldest copy in existence of the Popul Vuh. For years, the Newberry Bookstore, located in the lobby of the library, curated a selection of books reflecting the Newberry's collection strengths and upcoming public programming while also offering cards, posters and literary action figures. But that was then and this is now. Today, the venerable Newberry Library is making a bid to be more welcoming and relevant with its $12.7 million first-floor makeover, which includes marble wainscotting, new display cases, revamped exhibition spaces, vibrant graphics pulled from vintage books and maps reproduced in massive fashion on the walls. More than ever, the Newberry wants to share its collections of rare books and other documents and to stimulate intellectual engagement, especially among the post-academic crowd. The recent opening of the Rosenberg Bookshop and Herget Welcome Center allows new visitors to sign up for reading cards and learn to use the collections right as they enter, instead of having to go up to the third floor as in prior years. Also on display is the Library's first-ever permanent exhibition showcasing treasures of Chicago's past in a new display case just off the lobby--""Pictures from an Exposition: Visualizing the 1893 World's Fair."" It includes an impressive collection of historic photographs, drawings, maps, postcards and souvenirs from Jackson Park's legendary White City. The timing corresponds with the 125th anniversary of the World's Columbian Exposition as well as the dedication of the current Newberry building. The Newberry is open Tuesday through Thursday from 9 to 5 and Saturday from 9 to 1.",Newberry Library,November 2018,50

Also, there's not much here except the shell of the House, as the family was very private and took few photos and there much has been lost to history.  As a result, there's virtually no original furniture, only two of the three floors are open to the public, and the second floor is just used as office space.  I enjoy touring historic houses, but the Charnley-Persky is just not one of the most notable ones.",Charnley-Persky House,October 2018,30
Seeds of Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright,Taylor B,"The James Charnley Residence, also known as the Charnley-Persky House, is one of the few surviving residential works of noted architect Louis Sullivan and features major contributions by Frank Lloyd Wright, who was then working as a draftsman in Sullivan's office. Built in 1892 and located at 1365 North Astor Street in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood, at the southeast corner of North Astor Street and East Schiller Street, it is a three-story structure with a raised basement of stone and 2 1/2 stories of largely austere brickwork. The facade is divided into three parts--the main entrance, a projecting ornate wooden balcony and flanking sections with single sash windows. The interior is a marked contrast to its relatively plain exterior. Visitors--guided tours are free on Wednesdays--are awestruck by the high-quality woodwork throughout with built-in bookcases featuring doors with glass of varying shapes and sizes. The main library features a fireplace of African rose marble and the dining room has extensive use of mahogany, a favorite wood of Sullivan. Today, the house is a historic house museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1998.",Charnley-Persky House,December 2018,50
SULLIVAN WRIGHT HOUSE ON NEAR NORTH SIDE!,Jo-Ann M,"This private house museum designed by Louis Sullivan assisted by Frank Lloyd Wright with docent run tours on Wed and Sunday by the Society of Architectural Historians is worth seeking out.  The Sunday we went we signed up for the Chicago Architecture Center's Astor Street tour for 1 1/2 hours followed by the separate tour of Charnley.  Called the ""first modern house"" by Wright, the Charney was quite a contrast to the gilded age mansions lining Astor Street of the same time period.  The story is the Charnleys had a mansion along Lake Shore and wanted a simpler house which they asked their friend Sullivan to design for them.  The floorpan is modestl and quite simple showcasing beautiful quarter sawn oak moldings and floorboards, Sullivan's carved oak fireplace panels, oak bookcases and many simple arches connecting the rooms. Highlights are the huge inside front door carved out of 3"" thick oak with 2 simple triangular carvings integral to the door (not simply attached) and the woodwork of the central stairwell topped with a large skylight.  The house has a simple wood beading decorating the bookcases, the stairwell uprights and many other areas in the house.  Apparently, the mechanics of producing this type of beading had recently been discovered and it is hypothesized that Wright may have used it throughout the house.  Our docent was well informed and our tour group was small so it was a perfect historic house tour. On Sunday the tours are at 10 and noon and you really cannot self-tour.  Note:  the entrance for the tour is not the front door but at the southern end of the house where a stairway leads down to the basement tour entrance.  Highly recommended",Charnley-Persky House,April 2019,50
Sullivan design is so awesome but tour is lacking,lunareist,"Anyway,  the guide was really not sure who designed what and was giving credit to Wright when there were obvious Sullivan design details.  This only propagates more misinformation.  Sure there's A Wright Society in existence today, but Louis Sullivan was truly the master.",Charnley-Persky House,August 2018,30

It was not the original and I'm so upset about it. I am 60 years old and probably will never see it again. I dreamt of seeing the dance of the sugar plum fairies,which did not happen instead the world fair performers danced.  I wish I could get my money back.

This is a great play, written by Duncan Macmillan and directed by Jessica Fisch, that deals with depression and suicide and it’s effects on people we love. The actress, Rebecca Spence, was phenomenal and brought the audience to tears one moment and laughter the next. The play is presented in an intimate setting with a small audience and is an interactive experience for everyone. Some audience members did no more than read a line when requested but others such as myself became part of an improvisation with Rebecca!

Gangsters,bukagirl,Cool area to walk around in and if you like gangster history check it out!,Biograph Theatre,October 2018,40
One of Chicago's most popular tourist destinations,Taylor B,"How does a motion picture theatre become a Chicago Landmark (2001) and earn a spot on the National Register of Historic Places (1984)? By being site where a well-known gangster was killed. Located at 2433 North Lincoln Avenue in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood, the Biograph Theater is notable as the location where bank robber John Dillinger was shot by FBI agents after watching a gangster movie on July 22, 1934. The Biograph, which opened in 1914, featured many of the distinguishing characteristics of movie houses of the 1930s, including a storefront-width lobby, recessed entrance, free-standing ticket booth and canopy marquee. The building was finished in red pressed brick and white-glazed terra cotta. In July 2004, after 90 years as a movie theater under various owners, Chicago's Victory Gardens Theater purchased the Biograph for use as a venue for live theatrical productions. The theater was completed renovated with a stage and seating for 299 people, dressing rooms and an adjacent rehearsal/multiple-use space that cost $11 million. The project was completed in 2006 with the new Victory Gardens at the Biograph featuring a new stage that is 30 feet deep and 32 feet wide and 16 feet of wing space on either side and an eight-foot trap space beneath the stage. Today, Victory Gardens is a popular destination for theater-goers but locals and tourists still know the site as the Biograph, where FBI agent Melvin Purvis gunned down the FBI's most wanted man, John Dillinger.",Biograph Theatre,April 2019,50

It’s a modern place with plenty of stores and dining options, and even an AMC movie theater. I would say it has the crisp appearance of a high-end shopping mall without necessarily the stores and prices that you usually find in that sort of mall.

"Chicago Has Blues and the Cubs, We Get It",mjmanning201,"There really didn't need to be two separate exhibits on the Blues in Chicago. There was a lot but most of the blues came out of the Mississippi Delta, Memphis, St. Louis and New Orleans.  I also believed that the museum tended towards being somewhat Afro-Centric in that most of the museum was dedicated to Black culture in the city. Also, there are TWO major league baseball teams in Chicago.  You would not know this by walking through the museum store without any White Sox memorabilia. The small exhibit in the museum that does include the White Sox is pale in comparison to the Cubs exhibit.  Yeah, they won the World Series in 2017, But the White Sox won in 2005 and I sincerely doubt y'all had a blow out exhibit for them. Also, why have the  Appomattox surrender table in storage? That is probably the most historic piece that you possess and it should be on permanent display. (I'm sure Libby Custer intended it to be exhibited when she donated it to the museum) If your're not going to put it on display, donate it to the National Park Service so they can display it at Appomattox Court House National Historic Park in Virginia.",Chicago History Museum,June 2019,30

Gem on the Southside.,Joe B,"Most people don’t really venture to the Southside of Chicago as a tourist destination. However, near the University of Chicago is one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Robie House. This has been completely renovated as of April 2019. It looks remarkable and the dining room with the original table is breathtaking. And to think at one time they were going to demolish this historic home. Fortunately for us they saved this gem. Why only 4 stars? OK, parking is a pain in the backside especially today when graduation was held next door. We parked several blocks away and barely made our tour on time. The other thing is the docent was a bit of a low talker and we gather not as knowledgeable as guides in the past. Maybe we are wrong but we have been on several tours of FLW homes in the past and weren’t fully convinced.

You have to be there in person to get your tickets and tour.  We rode the bus to the Science and industry Museum then got a Lyft to the house to make our tour.  Should have probably went there first and got our tour time confirmed before going to the museum because we almost didn’t have a tour to join when we got there at 1:30.

It has a unique style with exterior load-bearing walls and an interior steel frame, which provided a transition between accepted and new building techniques. The lobby was remodeled in 1905 by Frank Lloyd Wright and restored to the original Wright design in 1989. The red marble, terra cotta and brick facade of the building is a combination of Roman Revival and Queen Anne styles that embraced Richardsonian Romanesque architecture. Aside from the first two floors of metal-framed perimeter walls, the walls are all masonry. The building also is known for its semi-circular staircase west of the central, glass-covered light court that serves as the focal point for the entire structure. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, designated a Chicago Landmark in 1970 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975.",The Rookery Building,March 2019,50
Hidden Gem in Chicago,mom22smartchix,"I work across the street and always love to sneak in to catch a glimpse of a bygone era! Gilded trim and curved staircase accent the marble, but to think it was once a functioning Rookery is amazing! A must see for anyone interested in light and design.",The Rookery Building,February 2019,50
Gorgeous Chicago Landmark. Wonderful decorative elements.,Alicia H,"I highly recommend taking the 30 minute guided tour of the Rookery Building. The guide was personable and shared a lot of interesting details about the building's history, the architects, and the decorative elements, and the restoration projects. Plus, if you take the tour, you will go up the magnificent staircase and get to see the 2nd and 3rd floor. If you aren't with a tour, you can't go past the lobby. Stunning building!

Everyone I interacted with had a kindness about them and you could sense that they were very happy and proud to be a part of such an amazing place.

Not bad to do once,553amandar,"I went here with my husband after purchasing a discount coupon.  We are both in our mid thirties, and while we were quite a bit older than most of the crowd there, we still had as much fun as everyone else.  We enjoyed going through the maze, but once you figure out your way through the first part, the rest goes by pretty quickly.  It took about 10-15 minutes.  As part of our coupon we also go to play the Time Freak games.  It killed some time and kept us entertained for a few minutes.  It let us act like kids and brought out our competitive sides. I would say that this was a good deal with the coupon, but I don't know that I would pay regular price or do a repeat visit.",Amazing Chicago's Funhouse Maze,November 2013,30
"Fun, but try to find discount tickets",KimH676,We visited this  attaction because i purchased a groupon. We certainly laughed and enjoyed it but I wouldn't  have wanted to spend the published rate of $10/person. Our teenagers had fun and we all laughed throughout the maze.

The staff was very friendly - huge plus when young people take pride in doing their job. ,Amazing Chicago's Funhouse Maze,April 2014,30
Best in the City!,John C,"A beautiful architectural landmark! The unique baroque interior, done in the ""Polish Cathedral Style"", has remained intact for more than a century.

Amazing?,AngieS701,"At $12 it is expensive. However, if you can get a coupon it is very reasonable. When it is not crowed, you can expect to spend 40 minutes going through the maze and playing the two head to head games. I actually wished I would have paid a little more for the all day pass. Then we would have revisited the maze again before we left Navy Pier. The kids are 8 and 4. Our 4 year old loved it. We did have to teach her to walk with her hands stretched out so that she would not run into a mirror like a bird into a window. It was a nice AC break for a hot summer day at Navy Pier.",Amazing Chicago's Funhouse Maze,May 2014,40
"Okay, but don't count on spending more than 30 minutes there",Vezich,"Luckily we had purchased tickets through groupon before our trip, otherwise I would have felt ripped off.

Another Wright house open to the public,Taylor B,"Some people make a pilgrimage of visiting all of famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright's houses. We have visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania and the Robie House in Chicago. Now we have added another one to our list, the Emil Bach House, which opened for public tours in the summer of 2014. It is always worth a trip to admire the unique designs of Wright and the Bach House, built in 1915, is one of the most interesting because it is the only survivor of a group of five Chicago and Oak Park structures that Wright designed after his 1911 return from Europe. Located at 7415 North Sheridan Road in the Rogers Park neighborhood, it is part of a series of geometric, cubic homes with overhanging roofs designed by Wright in the early 20th century. It is a 2,700-square-foot Prairie style house in a compact square on the first level built around a fireplace and Wright's signature inglenook. The inglenook and living room are separated by an unusual built-in dining table made of a single slab of black walnut. The second level is cantilevered over the first and features three small bedrooms, each with an outdoor balcony. A rear open balcony offers a peek of Lake Michigan. In 2009, James Pritzker of the famous Pritzker hotel/investment family purchased the home for $1.7 million. After an extensive renovation that saw several Wright features restored after being removed by previous owners, the house was opened to the public for tours on Wednesdays only and for vacation rentals and special events. It was declared a Chicago Landmark in 1977 and was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1979. They don't build houses like this anymore. But if you've been to Fallingwater, still one of the most beautiful homes ever built in this country, you know that already.",Emil Bach House by Frank Lloyd Wright,January 2015,50

Open late, Free  complimentary valet and the food is constantly good. Also really convenient  for after event dinning from United Center. Only a 5 min drive. Greek town its mainly casual dress but you will find a mix of everyone and every style here.

Limited Fun,happytraveler048,"I got a Living Social deal for the Funhouse Maze at $5 per person.  This cheaper price helped a bit considering it was a rather quick trip through this maze.  It reminded me more of a carnival spook house, rather than a real maze.  The maze part was small, as well as the rest of the attraction.  We took a 9 year old and 6 year old.  They both thought it was fun and went through it with little to no fear.  The 6 year old held my hand at the beginning, but quickly went with her brother ahead of my husband and me.  Our deal did include a free ticket for ""Time Freak"" which is a 1 minute race hitting buttons that light up and competing against another team.  All in all the Funhouse Maze attraction was a good time, but could have been much more for the price.

Lovely,Haley L,"Scents, colors, store layout, shoes, suiting, cosmetics - they're all lovely. However, the most enjoyable thing about this store is the staff. The customer service can't be beat.

Greek Aura,Zia_Khan,"Since it is next to my University, I have been there a zillion times and yet it seems fresh every time. The catch is the location with views of Sky scrapers on East, open space on South and beautiful restaurants on North and that's where you will be walking. The restaurants have taken care to have a modern calm look that is supplemented with lots of windows on the street so that you can actually see the people relaxing, smiling and enjoying their time. Its a small part of a big city but for anyone looking for greek food or good time, its a stop worth having.",Greektown,April 2014,40
Small and Overrated,conrade886,"I'd been here a few times when living in Chicago and I have to say this neighborhood is small, and aside from the Greek flags and occassional lettering, not very convincing. Considering the large Chicagoland Greek population, I don't think this neighborhood does that group justice due to its small size and its unencompassing feeling. Greek Street or the Greek Block would be a better suited name for it as Halsted Street goes through a variety of different segments of Chicago's population. Drive through here if looking for one of those restaurants and go here for the Greek Festival but other than that, this place isn't very special.",Greektown,October 2013,10
Smells Nice,Kelli T,"We actually got lost here and ended up wandering around for a couple of hours taking pictures and smelling the food.  It's a nice area, if a bit small and good for a walk.",Greektown,March 2014,30
South side is taking over,Mike A,2 years ago and before this place was crawling with college students from the north side of the city all the way to the south side at all hours of the day.  Greektown has a few great fine dining restaurants (That are safe to eat at before midnight). Greektown also has a few fast food places that are open 24 hours a day. Greektown is no longer a safe place after midnight because all the thugs from the south side have taken over and and started shooting every weekend. When this 1st started happening it was all over the news but now it's not because it police try to hide the fact that they are losing control of Chicago.... Im giving greektown a 3 overall because the restaurants owners and the quality of food deserve a 5. But sadly the black gang's from the south side have made it not a safe place to be after dark. For anyone.(including the restaurant employees) ,Greektown,July 2014,30
Avoid King Cafe,Al104,"Visited Memorial weekend. Excellent shopping but experience ruined by rude service at King Cafe.

A beautiful surprise.,Hopeart,"The garden was a real surprise right in the middle of Millennium Park.  Even at the end of the summer season, the plants and the design of the outdoor space provided a lush spot of beauty in the center of the city.  Our tour guide was excellent, giving great information about the plants and the design of the space.  Her enthusiasm was infectious.  Don't expect a highly manicured European-style garden.

Although there are similarities in dishes across restaurants, each has its own specialties and character. Convenient dining location for United Center events. You'll also find outlets for Greek baked goods, as well as other food and liquor specialties, and the relatively new museum which is at the south end.

The garden is walled off by a hedge of trees from the rest of the park, but the entrance does not look inviting.  In spite, Lurie garden is one of the gems in Millennium Park.

Do a little historical reading on the prisoners of war camps in Chicago during the Civil War and you'll better understand the mass graves in this cemetery.  There is also an interesting Jewish cemetery to investigate.  There is a melted piece from the Chicago Fire and many more historical graves.  I recommend going early in the morning , since the neighborhood  isn't what it use to be!  Take a camera along so when you tell others about it , they will believe  and want to come and see for themselves.

Wasn't as Good as I Remembered ,Gregrob1980,I use to like this Bloomingdales's when they carried Ralph Lauren men's Black Label. Now it's not as good as I remembered. Lacking in assortment.

Greek food galore ,DDay1959,"On my recent business trip to Chicago, I stayed at a hotel close to this area. I decided to take a walk and it out.

Very talented artist. From the beginning to the end the music and the attire made you feel as if you were grooving to such artists as; Smokey Robinson, Gladys Knights and the Pips, Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding just to name a few. Not only were the artist great but the audience participation was tip top.

Another great Chicago Auto Show,277eg,"Visited the Chicago Auto Show every year with family and friends. This is an extremely large place to visit so be sure one of you pays close attention to how you entered the building, where you have parked, and any signs pointing your way to this attraction. Expect a lot of walking and warm inside temperature so be sure so flip a coin on the type of shoes and jacket your going to wear. We noticed a pretty large selection of cars, trucks, and odd transportation this year, lots to look at as well as displays to interact with. You could have trouble getting a good look at these autos if you have small children, they seem to love to crawl in and out of these autos in excitement and will probably take up most of an adults viewing time so prepare yourself. Some of the exhibits allow you to ride in some great choices of vehicles. Lots of food to snack on and things to drink so bring a little cash along. Plenty of washrooms. Don't forget about some type of camera in case you need to snap a quick picture. This event keeps getting better and I probably could mention more things however, why spoil it for you. We will most likely return again next year. Have fun !",Chicago Auto Show,February 2017,50
Great show of cars,ASuthar,Excellent spot if you are in the new car market or passionate about cars.   Not much for younger kids though.  Lots of walking therefore wear comfy shoes!

There were lots of things that would interest children, like rides, fudge, other food, etc.  It was too busy for me, so I just walked through and didn't stay long.  There was a line to look at the new Mercedes SUVs, which I didn't want to wait in.  Wear comfortable walking shoes, and bring lots of patience.  You can drive and park for about $23, or there is lots of public transportation like buses.  Even special buses specific to the auto show.  Tickets to the show are around $12, I think, but you can bring 3 cans of food to donate and get $6 off your ticket.",Chicago Auto Show,February 2017,30

Chicago is home to a large Ukrainian community and they show their ongoing commitment and concern for their countries history and current affairs.  The numbers of Ukrainians who were murdered in the 20th Century is hard to phantom and unheard of in history lessons.  The Ukrainian eggs are so unique and beautiful and if you think you'd like to learn how to make them, they have classes available.  Made to feel very welcomed by the knowledgeable staff and left wanting to return and learn more.",Ukrainian National Museum,October 2014,50
Interesting and not the mainstream,Oleg S,"A very interesting and unique museum about Ukraine and Ukrainians located in the historical Ukrainian Village neighborhood of Chicago.

Fascinating Introduction to Ukrainian Culture,Chuck A,"I went exploring the Ukrainian Village neighborhood with a friend and thought this would be one of several highlights of this neighborhood.  We were so delighted to meet one of the tour guides who gave us a comprehensive tour of this museum.  She made the exhibits come to life with her zeal for Ukrainian culture and insights into that country's current events.  The exhibits covered such things as the Ukraine's traditional arts, costumes, rural life, and history.  Afterwards, we had time to examine this museum's many fascinating items.  It is especially great to accompany a visit  here with a visit to the nearby Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art, Louis Sullivan's Holy Trinity Orthodox Church, and neighboring Ukrainian churches.",Ukrainian National Museum,March 2016,50
hidden Miro,nickd18,this was one of the items I was guided to on a self guided art tour that I did.  This was directly south of the Picasso.  Out of all of the stops this one was my least favourite.  It's a large piece tucked into a plaza that really doesn't allow any light to hit the work (it faces north).  Maybe it was the location or maybe it was something else but I didn't appreciate the work.,Miro's Chicago,April 2016,30

Marquette vs. DePaul basketball ,mariont372,Cons - horrible parking arrangements and not enough or big enough shuttles.  My husband said the men’s room was small- only 4 urinals.  Concession stands were a joke.  Waited 25 minutes to get a beer.  There were unmanned registers.  Only had beer to drink.  What about non-beer drinkers?  Security took forever to get in then at the end they were yelling at us to get out.  Will think twice about going to an event here again.,Wintrust Arena,February 2018,10

Small town shopping in the big city,Allen21096,"Lincoln Square is one of the more desirable areas in Chicago.  Not the least of that is because of the restaurants and the nightlife in this area.  There are a lot of restaurants and pubs in the immediate area and the restaurants range from Argentinean to German to Greek to Thai and many more.  In the center of Lincoln Square at approximately Giddings, there is a small park with a fountain to rest and relax.  There are a number of really cool shops, including toy shops, an apothecary and cooking shops.  Though there is parking on Lincoln Ave from Lawrence Ave. proceeding south, there is more parking at the end of the mall at Leland Ave. in a parking lot.  Oh, don't forget to feed the parking meters.",Lincoln Square,December 2016,50
A thriving restaurant & shopping district,Allen21096,"The main part of Lincoln Square is basically located along Lincoln Ave. between W. Lawrence Ave. &  W. Leland Ave.  It is all just east of Western Ave.  That is the part that has reduced, one-way (south) traffic and the small park in the middle, as well as street arches at either end.  As the weather gets warmer, besides sitting at the square with the fountain, many of the restaurants have outdoor seating.  It is a great spot to people watch, while you're having a meal.  There are many restaurants in this area, some of which include Barba Yianni Grecian Taverna, Artango Bar & Steakhouse (Argentinian), Garcia's Restaurant (Mexican), Pannenkoeken Cafe (Dutch), Chicago Brauhaus (German), Rosded Restaurant (Thai), which means you can be an international foodie traveler and almost eat on a different continent for a week.  There are also sandwich shops, yogurt shops, cupcake shops and more, as well as a great toy store, a book store with wine and a cooking school.  Oh, did I mention the apothecary?  There is a lot to do here, so just go shopping and then step in to another country to eat.",Lincoln Square,April 2017,50
Not much for nostalgia seekers,Arthur G,"Lincoln Square was once the heart of a modest German district in Chicago, but time has reduced the number of (nearly) authentic German businesses to just a handful. Still, for someone in Chicago looking for at least a minimal German experience, there are a few worthy of mention directly on Lincoln Avenue; a drugstore (Merz Apotheke), a shoe store (Salamander), a beer hall/restaurant (Chicago Brauhaus) and a deli/meat market/wine shop (Gene's) that are very good facsimiles of those in Germany (know from experience). As others have noted, Lincoln Square today is a much broader business base, but this review deals only with the German shops. There is extremely limited parking at Lincoln Square, but the district is accessible by the ""El"" and other public transportation. The places named are actually 4-5 star worthy, but the overall Lincoln Square experience is only a 3 rating.",Lincoln Square,May 2016,30
Beautiful old world charm ,nhigdon,Great worship space inspiring for Catholic and non Catholic alike. A Chicago landmark not to be missed.,St. John Cantius Church,December 2015,50
Beautiful church and service,cindy435,"We went to the 12:30 Sunday service.  I am a life-long Catholic but had never been to the  Extraordinary Form of the Mass (Tridentine High Mass in Latin).  Basically, this is how mass was in my parent's day.  Most of it was in Latin.  Priest has his back to you.  The priest chants quite a bit. You stand and kneel at somewhat different times. There is a choir (which sounds quite professional) that chants in Latin and sounds beautiful in this old cathedral.  You kneel when you go up for communion and take the host on your tongue.  It is also fun to notice that many of the women also covered their heads for the mass.  Overall, it was a really good experience.  The main drawback is that the church is not air conditioned and we attended during a heat wave.  Not good. The church is also undergoing renovations although there is still plenty to look at. It would have been 5 stars if not for those problems.  If you go to mass a year or so from now in decent weather, it will be a 5 star experience.   It is a short cab ride from downtown or you can also take public transportation (we took a cab there and then used the subway and walked back). ",St. John Cantius Church,July 2016,40
My parish,Mrs T,"This is a church with gorgeous Baroque architecture, and traditional, liturgical stylings to the services.  Similar to what you see in European churches. Most of their services are in Latin.  There is at least one in English on Sunday though. If you're Catholic, there are excellent confessors here. This is not watered down Catholicism (thankfully).  This is what your grandma was taught and loved. Many women wear veils. Please support them as able...they are trying to send more men to the seminary.  I love this place.",St. John Cantius Church,September 2016,50
Beautiful Baroque Church in Chicago,The_Traveling_Expat,"The church of St. John Cantius is a lovely early 19th century church built in the baroque style that is commonly found in the churches of Europe.  It is one of the architectural jewels of Chicago churches.  In addition, the church is home to the Canon Regulars of St. John Cantius, which is a religious order that celebrates the Latin Mass.  This place is definitely worth visiting for not only the lover of art and architecture but seeing the Latin Mass within the context of the sacred art even if one is not religious is quite a unique experience.  In addition, the church also holds a small museum of Neapolitan presepia, which is particularly worth seeing during the Christmas season.",St. John Cantius Church,November 2016,40
Becoming beautifully restored,Allen21096,"Going to Mass at St. John Cantius, especially the Christmas Midnight Mass, is extraordinary.  It is a Latin mass with a full choir.  If you ever went to a Catholic Church before Vatican II, this is the way the Mass was.  The altar & chancel are beautifully decorated for Christmas and its holy days.  Though long, the Mass is definitely something to go to.  If you have never been to a Latin Mass, it is worth going, at least once in your life.",St. John Cantius Church,December 2016,50

What an opportunity!,James M,"We were considering a room at the Lang House B&B next door and were told that the entire Bach House was available due to a cancellation. As a Wright fan, I found that an opportunity we had to seize. Bruce was welcoming and showed us through the house and grounds ... what an opportunity! The restoration of the house and grounds (manicured lawn, beautiful landscaping) was done about four years ago, and includes outdoor seating and a Japanese teahouse retreat. We spent as much time as possible in the house just enjoying the ambience. You’ll check in at Lang House and be able to appreciate that restoration as well. The area has built up since 1915, and Sheridan Road is noisy, but didn’t keep us awake. There’s just a sliver of Lake Michigan that can be seen from one of the bathrooms.

An example of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie style architecture,Taylor B,"There are many historic houses in the Chicago area. Unfortunately, many of them aren't open to the public and have been converted into condominiums. Fortunately, the Emil Bach House survives and is open to the public. Located at 7415 North Sheridan Road in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, one block from Lake Michigan, it is a Prairie style house that was designed by famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Built in 1915 for an admirer of Wright's work, Emil Bach, co-owner of the Bach Brick Company. The 2,700-square-foot, two-story single family residence with a basement is representative of Wright's late Prairie style and is an expression of his creativity from a period just before his work shifted stylistic focus. The Bach House was declared a Chicago Landmark in 1977 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is one of the homes Wright designed after his 1911 return from Europe. It is part of a series of geometric, cubic homes with overhanging, flat roofs designed by Wright in the early 20th century. Of the houses of this type in Chicago, the Bach House is the only one left standing. When constructed, it was perceived as a ""country home"" with a clear view of Lake Michigan from its rear or east facade. Today, it stands among commercial properties and apartment buildings on busy North Sheridan Road. While the Bach House sits on prime Chicago real estate, it has been saved from demolition by a historic preservation easement.",Emil Bach House by Frank Lloyd Wright,March 2019,50
Historic Masterpiece,BridgewaterCTdad,"We rented the house while attending graduation at Loyola University.  This place is magnificent.  The kitchen is fully equipped and the guest rooms are lovely.

Unexpected treasure,bfly1,"One doesn't expect to see an authentic meadow in the middle of one of the world's largest metropolis.  At no charge. It was in full glory in late summer.  The diversity was spectacular, and not lost on the many bees and butterflies collecting the abundance of floral rewards for their pollination services. At one point, I interacted with a guide, who gave me very interesting information about specific plant species.  For the kids, there is an artificial stream running through the garden, and on this hot humid day, both parents and kids were sitting on the granite blocks, dipping their feet. At the time I visited, a symphony orchestra (perhaps THE symphony orchestra?) was practicing in the band shell beyond, and we could hear the music as though seated in a concert hall. Quite a sensory experience.  I strongly recommend it, with the caution that flower diversity and abundance will vary seasonly.",Lurie Garden,July 2019,50

From the energetic center window to the stones and the armed statuary, this building screams M. Night Shyamalan. There is an ancient secret it whispers into the wind, and wrapped in air it flows through all the buildings in the City. There are captions written on stone tablets above doorways, on architraves and pillars. And when you concentrate those stories come sailing through the gap between the insulating strip and your fenestration. They touch you and it feels wrong. The stories you'll hear don't match the lofty stone inscriptions. But listen anyway. Chicago's past, present and future want to talk to you. They want you to know.",St. James Chapel,July 2018,40

"Every bit as impressive as Graceland, Arlington and Hollywood",Taylor B,"My wife and I have visited many famous cemeteries in our travels across the country. Most notable are Arlington National Cemetery in Washington DC, Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, and Graceland in Chicago. Perhaps most overlooked of all is Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago. Located at 1035 East 67th Street, on Chicago's South Side, in the Grand Crossing neighborhood, the large Victorian era cemetery was established in 1853, covers 183 acres and is the final resting place for several famous Americans. The first burials took place in 1860. After the Civil War, more than 4,000 Confederate soldiers who had died as prisoners at Camp Douglas were reburied there.

Greensky Bluegrass,mattf943,I haven’t been to this old Chicago venue in almost 17 years. The place still has that nostalgic feel to it even moreso perhaps then ever. The entrance is smooth with a slight patdown and inside you go. Coat check ran smoothly and had 2 locations. The bars never had a line of more then 3 patrons which is pretty good considering the volume of people inside. Balcony seating is nice and plenty of room for general admission on the floor. Security seems pretty mellow inside as long as your not too crazy with what your doing. Sound is excellent on the floor I can’t say for the balcony as we were up close to the stage all evening. ,Riviera Theatre,December 2018,50

The fact that they get away with selling shows to capacity knowing that the majority of those ticket holders will not not be able to see the show should be considered a fraudulent business practice.",Riviera Theatre,November 2019,10

We try to make it down to Greek town once a year and usually eat at Athena. Another place we like is Artopolis on Halsted which is much cheaper with a great assortment of bakery and sandwiches.

A leader and innovator in African-American arts,Taylor B,"Chicago is a great theater town. It's the home of Steppenwolf, the home of improvisational comedy that opened the door to Saturday Night Live. But Chicago theater is much more than that. And, until recently, my wife and I weren't aware of Black Ensemble Theater. Located at 4455 North Clark Street, near Clark and Montrose, in the Uptown neighborhood, it is housed in the Black Ensemble Theater Cultural Center, a magnificent $20 million complex that was opened on November 18, 2011. The theater, which was founded in 1976, is recognized as one of the most diverse theaters in Chicago, a nationally and internationally renowned arts institution, a leader and innovator in the African-American and mainstream arts communities. Its mission is to eradicate racism an its damaging effects upon our society through the utilization of theater arts. The driving force behind all of this is Jackie Taylor, the founder and CEO of Black Ensemble Theater and an accomplished actress, producer and playwright who was born in Chicago and raised in the Cabrini Green housing project. She has written and produced more than 100 plays and musical biographies, including Marvin Gaye, Jackie Wilson, Teddy Pendergrass, Dionne Warwick and Billie Holiday. Upcoming productions are Mahalia Jackson: Moving Thru the Light, from March 2 to April 14; They Keep Talkin About Me, a musical that helps young people to understand how to ignore the negative and embrace the positive, on April 25-26 and May 2-3; and Urban Love Story: The Anti-Violence Play, which speaks to violence of today, offering youth practical solutions to eliminate violence from their lives by using hip hop, R&B and dance to motivate young people to communicate with each other through positivity, respect, patience and understanding, on May 23-24 and May 30-31. It is entertainment designed to showcase some of the greatest musical talents of our time and focus on issues confronting young people on a daily basis. It's an evening well spent.

"Stellar performances, spiritually uplifting, a gem!",Pamela B,"This theatre is so wonderfully unique. It is not only an intimate atmosphere, where you are close to the stage and can observe the joy of the audience.  The hospitality at this theatre is unlike any other.  The musical performers are so talented.  There is always a live band and extremely talented vocal performers honoring various celebrities from the past.  I have enjoyed three shows at this theatre and strongly recommend it for the highest quality entertainment.  It is located on Clark street in the Lakeview neighborhood.  There is parking attached to the theatre and the tickets are very reasonably priced.  Don’t miss this experience!",Black Ensemble Theater,March 2019,50
Outstanding music and actors.,ConventionLady,The prices are very reasonable.  We got two tickets at senior price for $102 with all taxes and fees included.  You certainly can’t beat that in Chicago for the quality of the performances.,Black Ensemble Theater,April 2019,50
Wonderful entertainment,mamawin39,"I attended this theater for the first time last evening and am bowled over by the great time I had.  The subject matter changes periodically but basically, they highlight quality black entertainers.  The band and cast were terrific and I am still singing and dancing because of what I witnessed.  The energy level was incredible.  If you are in Chicagoland, please do yourself a favor and have a wonderful night out at this venue.  I cannot wait to go again.",Black Ensemble Theater,August 2019,50
An attempt on creating a Cinderella story much more relatable to the African American lacking hugely in production value,klu1,"Overall there were cast members who were notably talented, the stepmother and both daughters, the boys from the hood,the only white girl and possibly the King. Cinderella had shortcomings vocally, the Prince and the Queen completely lacking vocally. Other serious shortcomings were poor sound, poor lighting, ineffective musical score and absence of a set, lacking direction visible in the blocking and timing which grossly affected comedic value and a band that looked as if they did not want to be there. There was also decent enough dancers that could have used much more choreography throughout the show.",Black Ensemble Theater,December 2019,10
Better during the week,kevin389,"The last few years I've gone to the auto show on either a Tuesday or Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. when they open. Nowhere near the crowds and if you want to try one of the activities the lines are a whole lot less. This year due to some schedule conflicts, my daughter and I went on Sunday. Early Sunday. The parking garage of course was full so I went south on LSD to 31st Street and parked in the B section and then walked about two blocks to gate 27. Not too much of a wait to park and since we bought our tickets on line all the ticket takers had to do was scan our printed tickets.We also brought our own snacks and water with us and would recommend that you do the same. Unless you like paying $3.50 for a bottle of water. According to my daughters fit bit we walked 4.3 miles so comfortable shoes are a must. The free bags that Ford were handing out were a big help as well. Good place to store said water, snacks and coats when it gets too warm. Would have liked to see more prototypes  they were few and far between. Kudos to Honda for having Takuma Soto's (sic) Indy winning car there. The driving bits with Kia, Toyota and Dodge would have been nice to try except for the long lines. On a crummy winter day, this is the place to go.",Chicago Auto Show,February 2018,40

However, this is the most run-down of the old Chicago theaters I have been in recently.  VERY amateur repair work all over the place.  Makes me worry about the wiring.  No seats and people really push to the front to see.  I felt like I was in a continuous TSA pat down once the show started.  No isles kept open, people literally shoving their way through the crowd.

If you haven’t seen him in concert yet, I urge you to go.  I’ve read the reviews about how run down this venue is and how people felt unsafe, but that wasn’t my experience.  It’s just an old building that could use a remodel.  It gets hot in there, so dress accordingly.  The restrooms were clean and coat check easily accessible.  You can easily get there via the CTA Red Line or bus.  It’s a General Admission venue, so you must get there at least 3 hours before the show if you want to be close to the stage.  But the closer you get to the stage, the harder it’ll be to get drinks or get to the restroom.  Overall, a positive experience.  I’d definitely go again.",Riviera Theatre,February 2018,40

Fun Once You Manage to Get There,Kimberly C,"This is the largest auto show in the country.  We had not been in a few years, and my old car is 19 years old, so this COULD be the year for a new one.  The auto show is a great venue to go see everything there is, get in and out, check comfort, features, style, options, size, interiors, etc., from almost every auto maker in the country.  That way, you can quickly eliminate some for whatever reason or add others to your ""follow up and look further"" list.  There were plenty of representatives there to give you info without being pushy.  Most are now just signing you up for getting brochures via email, which eliminates having to haul around a stack of heavy paper.  It is very large and takes hours to go through it all.  There are not many concept cars any more, but a few makers showed some old classics which were cool.  You can ""test drive"" some trucks and such over obstacle-type courses, but that was a stand-in-line endeavor not for the faint hearted.  Lots of kids were sometimes annoying, especially when you're waiting for your opportunity to get in as a potential, serious buyer and the kids are just in there playing in the car.  There were lots of food vendors with pretty good variety, but as you might expect, high prices ($4 for water, $8 for a hot dog, etc).  Still, about the same or cheaper than going to the ball park!  Traffic was rerouted around McCormick Place, forcing us to head all the way down to 31st Street before we could turn around and go back up to Parking Lot A.  Have no idea why they did that.  Took forever to get there,  Lot A is definitely the way to go if you can though.",Chicago Auto Show,February 2019,40
Too many people,408adab,"We haven't gone to the auto show in quite a few years, and this time; it was okay but not great. We didn't see as many cars as we have in the past.

Tanya was my tour guide and she as well as other staff members explained many facts to me about Ukrainian history and culture both in Ukraine and the US, including what has been happening in the Ukraine since 2014 with President Putin and his attempts to “annex” Ukraine to the Soviet Republic—which the vast majority of Ukrainians DO NOT WANT. They wish to retain their freedoms, and I stand with them, even though I have no Ukrainian blood. Tanya and the staff of this great museum go out of their way to answer all your questions and make you feel like you belong here. Of particular note (and it was most distressing) was seeing news articles of severely undernourished people in the Ukraine during the “Great Famine” of the early 1900’s. This event was conceived by the Soviet government at that time in order to get control of Ukraine, and they succeeded. Thank God in 1990, Ukraine got its independence again. Hopefully they will continue in freedom and not be under any other government but their own. ",Ukrainian National Museum,February 2019,50

The architecture was really cool and it was a small, intimate venue which are the best. Everyone rushed to the stage and my brother and I casually walked upstairs and got seats front row on the rail. We had a great view and easy access to the bar right outside near our seats which was less packed than the bar downstairs where most people were at.

I am just happy I got out of there alive both times and that the building didn't collapse. I am not taking any more chances. Not one dollar has been invested into this place in decades. The place is beyond old. Entire pieces missing from the walls, ceiling is cracked, and a lot of things are broken and hanging. The place is also filthy and the stench is overwhelming. There is no AC. They do have one small, working fan, that can fall on someone's head any minute. During shows, it gets unbearably hot. My t-shirt got drenched within the first 15-20 minutes and I became irritable and sick from lack of oxygen, or the stench. The sound is also terrible. If you don't know the band very well, you have no idea what they are playing or saying. The bathrooms are a health hazard, if you can find a stall with a working door. It's absolutely impossible that this place could pass any inspections.",Riviera Theatre,September 2016,10

Made of steel, wire mesh, concrete, bronze and ceramic tile, it is Miro's most famous sculpture. It was commissioned in 1979 by Jane Byrne, the first female mayor of Chicago.

The arena is very nice, if not large. The concourse runs around the playing court in an elevated manner, which affords a decent view of the game action if you are shopping at food concessions or the team kiosk.

Saw Wilco here- concert started at 8, so we got there at 645 expecting to be standing in line for awhile before the doors open.  But they must have opened the doors early- we walked right in - no hassles with security- at all.  Headed up to the balcony, got seats about 15 rows up- great sight lines.  Acoustics were good, drink servers walking around, often.  We found parking in a lot basically across the street- $20.  Sure the place is old and needs some work- but was good with us.",Riviera Theatre,December 2014,40
"Great for a concert, but that's it.",Patrick P,"Do not arrive expecting a classic theatre experience.  It's divey,  drinks are slightly over priced (just like any other concert venue) and bathrooms are. . .well, you just do your business and get out. . .but you can see your favorite bands from up close and the sound system is great.  THINGS TO KNOW - for general admission, get there WELL before doors open if you want to stand up front on the floor.  The stage is not as elevated as most places and the floor is flat.  As a result, unless you're right up on the stage, your view is gonna suffer.  Hopefully you'll be behind short people, but you can't count on that.  Balcony seating is pretty good for the first 10 rows or so but you'll still need to get there early for those, too.  We waited 2 hours before doors opened for Wilco (why??  Because we're huge fans and it was a sold out show).  We got front row balcony in the center.  Awesome seats.  There are VIP boxes for a price, of course, but sometimes they're not offered for sale. There are a couple of bars nearby if you want to scope out the line prior to opening.  The Green Mill (jazz bar) and The Crew (sports bar). Parking is pretty much street only.  Lots are available, but only one that's close by and it's not available until just about the same time that the venue's doors open.  Hotels are not close by either.  We typically cab there from the Willows on Broadway and Surf almost 3 miles south of the theatre.  Getting a cab after a show is hit and miss, so if you linger after the final encore, you'll miss.  Again, can't stress this enough. ..going to the Riviera Theatre is no picnic, but if you know this upfront, and prepare, it's fine for a band you really love.",Riviera Theatre,December 2014,30
Great sound but it's a sad building,Jenfoxj,We went to see Papa Roach and Seether for a concert. We sat upstairs and the sound was great. I would go again for a concert at this location. We walked right in and had no issues with security. It may take a while to get a taxi while leaving which was a little rough for January. I love old architecture so it is sad to see the state of the building. You can see some of the old artwork and how beautiful the building was at one time. I know it's a concert venue so take it at that.,Riviera Theatre,January 2015,40

Kick Ass Workout! Build Strength and Confidence!,menkejt,"I have to say I'm a huge fan of my Lincoln Square ILKB location! I have been a member coming up on a month and I have already notice changes in my body and my overall day to day energy. I'm not a gym person, I never know where to begin so this was the perfect solution! The membership is well worth the money, and if you go 3+ times a week it's very affordable. Nothing better than investing in yourself:) They offer 35 classes a week to fit everyone's schedule. I used to be a lot more athletic than I'm currently am but the team does a great job at coaching and motivating. They take the time to show you the correct way, they will stop and run through a routine to make sure you are getting your best workout. The team atmosphere is great, they will push you but you have to be invested and motivated. You get to work with other members and you get to push yourself and see the improvements each and every class. They do several events including DJ night- high energy, fun themes and makes you wanting more along with team outings such as kickball! If you're looking for something unique, and fun while getting a full body workout I highly recommend you stop in and meet the team! They have both men and women's locker rooms, facility is very clean all the time.",Lincoln Square,May 2019,50
Summer Thursday nights are a blast,DisneyDad21,I grew up in this neighborhood and love coming back in summer for concerts in park and the farmers market. Great selection of restaurants and pretty decent shopping as well. Gene’s market is a must stop for good old fashioned German market and fabulous desserts.,Lincoln Square,August 2019,50
History Proves You Can Only Go So Far Back In Time,Chuck D,"My wife grew up four miles from Lincoln Square. She thought a trip there would be a walk down memory lane. Most of the memories were of how things have changed. Merz Apothecary seemed much larger than she remembered it, Probably because the store moved from its original location in 1982. :-) Worth a visit even for the men. Interesting collection of razors, shaving brushes, colognes, and dob kits. Same saga with the Meyer Delicatessen where Gene's Sausage Shop now stands. She remembered it being smaller. Still a very cool place to shop with many, many goodies from Europe you won't find in your Jewel/Osco. Great German beer selection. Would have been a great place for lunch ""Up On The Roof"" had it not been for the rain. So for lunch try Jerry's on Lincoln Ave. Very unique sandwiches and, of course, beer. It is after all an old German neighborhood.",Lincoln Square,August 2019,40
Locked - will try again,Betty C,We heard it was the most beautiful church in Chicago and wanted to visit it for awhile.  We called ahead last week and were told it was open.  We arrived on Monday to find the doors locked.  We did wander outside and the lady from the school next door was surprised to hear the doors were locked but suggested we didn't pull hard enough.  We gave it another try but the doors were definitely locked.  We called the office and a lady answered and said they were closed and would be open for the evening mass.  We left disappointed so unfortunately we have to give it a low rating.  We left and went to St Peters in downtown.  We will try visiting another time when we visit Chicago.,St. John Cantius Church,March 2018,10
The place to be for a Latin mass,Lincoln D,"I am a Catholic priest who has an interest in learning to celebrate the Latin Mass.  St John Cantius is one of the spiritual centers of the Latin Mass here in the United States.  Located just off of Chicago Avenue not far from the heart of downtown Chicago, it is a very beautiful, historic church.  I always tell people - go to a church during a Mass - experience the church in the way it was meant to be.  It is not a museum, but a place of worship.  By going to Mass there and worshipping the Lord, you will experience the church for the purpose it was built.  It is a beautiful place and a very beautiful liturgy.  The priests and seminarians are very friendly - I chatted with one of them after Mass.  I will be going back here in November for a Latin Mass workshop - cannot wait!!!",St. John Cantius Church,August 2018,50
A Glorious Sacred Space,SusanKelly29,The church community seems dedicated and traditional.,St. John Cantius Church,December 2018,50
One of the most beautiful Polish Churches in Chicago,Pawel S,"This Church is filled with history. It was built by Polish immigrants. The facade of the Church has the emblem of Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth (Polish Eagle, Lithuanian Vytis and Ruthenian St. Michael). One of the chapels has a scaled replica of Veit Stoss altarpiece from Krakow. It is an amazing replica. The Church is famous for its music. There are numerous free concerts of classical music played by renowned artists. You can also listen to great mass music composed especially for Latin masses each Sunday at noon during Tridentine High Mass in Latin. There is parking around and it is walking distance from the Blue Line (train). There is also a bus stop next to the church. A proper modest clothing is required for all visitors.",St. John Cantius Church,June 2019,50
The legacy of Chicago’s Polish community,AlexB10499,"Absolutely gorgeous church in the River West neighborhood of Chicago, and perhaps the finest of the many so-called “Polish Cathedrals” in the city. Chicago calls itself the largest Polish city outside of Warsaw, which acknowledges the city’s importance as a major place of convergence for Polish immigrants. True to this heritage, the church of St John Cantius features Polish writing on many of its interior frescoes and statues. Today it hosts a thriving parish community, including one of America’s preeminent Tridentine Mass congregations, and is a significant center for sacred art and music. I visited the church on a Sunday but not during mass, so I was free to walk around and take in the beauty of the architecture. If you are the kind of traveler who likes to get “off the beaten path,” but doesn’t have a ton of time to spare, a visit to this church is a good compromise. There’s a Blue Line subway station nearby, and it’s only about a 10-minute ride to here from the Loop.",St. John Cantius Church,October 2019,50
More fun than expected,JanetD2045,"Took our 10 year old and initially she felt nervous because of the warning for 5 years and younger may be scary.

Fun experience...but short in duration,d2016h,"My family (2 adults, 2 kids - 9 and 11) visited Navy Pier on a roasting hot day so we headed into the A/C to give this maze a try.  We bought the family combo pack ($40) which included the maze and two other games.  We were probably in the maze for 20 minutes tops.  The adults thought it was  funny, my 11 y.o. thought it was fun, and 9 y.o. thought it was scary.  Neither kid wanted to go in again, even though the tickets allowed for unlimited entry.  We did the other two games, which were fun but short.  It was pretty expensive way to spend half an hour but given the weather there wasn’t much choice of other things to do.",Amazing Chicago's Funhouse Maze,June 2018,40
Loud but fun,Shannonmarye,"My kids also got scared at all the signs saying 5 and younger will get scared.  I told my husband the reviews here said it was fine so our 4 year old went with him.

Don't go to this theater in the winter!,soysue,"I had a complete nightmare experience last night at this theater.  First of all, it is very run down and drab...the chandelier in the lobby is filthy, as is most of the theater.  The real nightmare began, though, when we tried to claim our coats.  The coatcheck is downstairs, and the line barely moved for an hour!  It was very frustrating, especially since the bathroom was in the same place, and I couldn't get down there, without pissing off a lot of people.  The place was overrun with security guards, who were unnecessary, especially since they did nothing to remedy the situation, until much, much later.  There is NO excuse for this, and I will never set foot in this venue again...no matter WHO is appearing there.",Riviera Theatre,January 2013,10
Cool old theater,Cheesehead88,It is a cross between retro cool and a dump. It retains a lot of the old fixtures and features of a past era. It could surely use a little renovation and the only bathrooms are in the basement. Saw Fall Out Boy there and it was packed. Very loud and very hot but kind of a fun experience.,Riviera Theatre,May 2013,30
Avoid This Place,daver852,"The Riviera Theatre has to be one of the worst places I have been to in my life.  I took my niece here for the Marilyn Manson concert on July 5.  They changed the time of the ""meet-and-greet"" and the concert without telling anyone in advance, so we ended up waiting seemingly forever to get in.  Once inside, the place is just unbelievable.  It looks as though no one has done any upkeep for fifty years:  it's dirty, smelly, and the paint is literally peeling off the walls.  It looks like it should be condemned.  I will say that the acoustics are good.  We sat in the balcony, and I was under the apprehension that it might collapse at any moment.  There is no air-conditioning!  Thank goodness it was a relatively cool day.  I can't even imagine what this place must be like if the temperatures are in the 90s.  The Manson concert was moved here after the Congress Theatre was temporarily closed due to code violations; since they allow this dump to stay open, the mind boggles thinking of what the Congress must be like.",Riviera Theatre,July 2013,10
Cool Theater/Old Pair of Shoes,Gregory M,"The Riviera Theatre is a small concert venue which is just like that old pair of shoes that was so comfortable, so cool looking (once) that you just can't bear to part with them, even though you barely wear them, if at all. I saw The Hives perform there in the 2000's and it was quite obvious that the place was really something awesome in its heyday. Unfortunately that passed several decades prior. Now it is surely a run down venue which still has decent acoustics, and the cool architecture still remains (though poorly painted over several times), although not much else of the glory days is still there. It IS dirty. It IS cramped. The only restrooms ARE in the basement. It DOES need some t.l.c. to get it back to something modern and nice. But! If you can look past a little disrepair and grime, past a lack of plentiful restrooms, past the seats which may be unbolted and unusable, you might have a really great time seeing some really great shows in a theatre which undoubtedly has a lot of charm left, despite some detractions and eye-sores. Don't go in with high expectations, and you will never be disappointed by this diamond in the rough.",Riviera Theatre,April 2013,30

Preserving Chicago's Swedish-American heritage,Taylor B,"Kurt Mathisson, a Swedish immigrant who was one of the leaders of the Andersonville community, founded the Swedish American Museum in Chicago in 1976 to preserve Chicago's Swedish-American heritage. Its mission is to interpret the immigrant experience for children and adults and promote an appreciation of contemporary Swedish-American culture through its arts and educational programs and its permanent collection of approximately 12,000 objects. In 1987, the museum was moved to its current location at 5211 North Clark Street in the Andersonville neighborhood, the ""Little Sweden"" of Chicago and one of the most concentrated areas Swedish heritage in the United States. The museum is housed in a 24,000-square-foot, three-story building. It features two gallery spaces with special art exhibits, ""The Dream of America"" exhibit, the Brunt Children's Museum of Immigration, a genealogy center and a museum store. ""The Dream of America: Swedish Immigration to Chicago"" is the main exhibit. Located on the second floor, it explores the struggles and triumphs of the Swedish immigrant experience. Visitors meet many characters within the exhibit, including Stinsa Olofsdotter, who is helping her son prepare for his journey to America in 1868, and Karl Nelson, whose family arrives in New York City in 1893. Special exhibits are Photography by Ludvig Peres and Pull of the Sea, the dramatic paintings of Leon Lundmark.",Swedish American Museum,April 2019,50

The museum is very inexpensive ($4.00 adults) and is worth an hour or two. They also have a wonderful gift shop filled with items from Sweden, about Sweden, etc. Most of the staff is of Scandanavian heritage, too, so Swedish is spoken. If you have Scandanavian relatives you can relate to what they offer. The entire North Clark Street area still has a few businesses that are Swedish bases (restaurants, bakery).

More elegant and more upscale than Water Tower Place,Taylor B,"900 North Michigan Shops or The 900 Shops Mall doesn't receive the celebrity that shines on Water Tower Place, located one block southeast. But thousands of customers attest to the fact that it is ""more elegant"" and ""more upscale"" than its more ballyhooed rival. In fact, 900 North Michigan was developed by Urban Retail Properties in 1988 as an upscale sister to Water Tower Place. Completed in 1989, at 871 feet tall, it currently is the eighth tallest building in Chicago and the 31st tallest in the United States. It is a visually stunning and highly desired shopping destination that resides on the north end of Chicago's vibrant Magnificent Mile. The exclusive tenant mix offers shoppers an unparalleled experience of over 70 luxury lifestyle shops anchored by Bloomingdale's and a strong lineup of national brands complemented by an eclectic collection of unique boutiques and a diverse selection of dining options. There are 450,000 square feet of shops and restaurants on seven levels. There also is a six-story atrium. Among the other shops are Gucci, Max Mara, Montblanc, J. Crew, Kate Spade, Banana Republic, Cache, Church's English Shoes, Sermoneta, Intimacy, Enchante, Steinway Piano, Goldsmith, Atlas Galleries, St. Croix, Adidas and Michael Kors. There is an excellent coffee shop and bakery at the entrance level and several quality restaurants on the upper floors, including Oak Tree restaurant and bakery, Frankie's pizzeria, Frankies' Scaloppine and Potbelly Sandwich Works. The 66-floor building also includes the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel and the Residences of 900 North Michigan. If you're shopping on Michigan Avenue, the 900 North building has to be a must-stop on your itinerary.",The 900 Shops Mall,June 2015,50

Annual visit,Kathy L,"My adult daughter loves coming here as part of her birthday celebration. Small outdoor markets from Europe and other countries. Food vendors have German offerings from potato pancakes to seafood to sausages. Beer and mulled wine along with non alcohol drinks in commemorative mugs. Always cold and windy so bundle up.

A hidden treasure in Andersonville,Snowbound-N-smiling,"We happened by this place and it became the highlight of our day. Lots of rich history about Swedish immigrants who settled in Chicago. Be sure to ck out ""A Dream of America Exhibit"" that takes you thru the life of a swedish traveler (shoes, suitcase & all) as they journey to their new home in America. You'll be glad you stopped in! Also a museum gift shop and numerous children's activities.Well worth seeing and they have free admission at certain times.  ",Swedish American Museum,February 2012,50
In praise of the Brunk Children's Museum of Immigration,Suchabooknerd,"Recently, on Smithsoniam Museum Day, my husband and I took our 1 year old son to the Swedish American Museum.  While this small museum dedicated to the history of Swedish-to-Chicago-immigration museum is really well curated and very interesting, the highlight of the whole place is the 3rd floor Brunk Children's Museum of Immigration.  Rather than untouchable displays of historical artifacts, it's a completely hands-on exhibit where young kids can climb a dock onto a boat, row a viking ship, play in a farmyard, and go inside not one but two small cabins that are representative of the Swedish immigration experience.  My son is only 1, but he had a blast running around the exhibits and looking at all the things, and I look forward to taking him back there as he grows up.  Free to IL residents on Tuesdays, this museum is a small little wonder in the lovely Chicago Andersonville neighborhood.",Swedish American Museum,September 2012,40

Great Venue!,ALKite,"Went to see a concert here, and loved the venue.  We elected to sit in the balcony area, the view was amazing.  I don't think there's a bad sight line in the whole place.  There was a bar and restrooms on the balcony level, the seating was like a movie theater.  There was no seating on the floor for this event, and all spots, sitting or standing, were first come first served.  There were plenty of servers taking drink orders, and they had a bracelet system to identify people who were over 21.  ",The Vic Theatre,April 2015,50
Great Selection of Shops! ,Gregrob1980,"I am not a big fan of malls, but this is one to stop by when your in Chicago.

Everyone wants to see the Picasso,joansQ8658IX,"The Richard J Daley Center is Cook County's main civil court house. If you are a court buff or visiting attorney, you may wish to go in and see a trial or hearing. The public is welcome to (quietly) visit the law library on the 29th Floor. Just going up there to gawk is discouraged, but if you quietly sit at a table near the window and enjoy the spectacular view and read something, no one is likely to kick you out. The Daley Center does have a web site and public affairs office where you can get more information and even arrange a tour. Throughout the year, events are held on the large plaza, which is anchored by a monumental work by Pablo Picasso. Children often slide on its base, but I think that this practice is disrespectful and not a safe activity for children, so I would discourage this. There is a farmer's market every Thursday in the summer months and a lovely Christmas Market from Thanksgiving to just before Christmas in this plaza. If you don't have much time, like monumental art and want to take an interesting walk in downtown Chicago, Start at the Thompson State of Illinois office Building on Clark and Randolph where you will find a large Dubuffet work in the plaza. Next cross the street to the Daley Center and see the Picasso. Directly across Washington, you will find a large Miro. proceed south on Dearborn.to Madison and turn right. Enter 69 W. Madison and admire the large Henry Moore sculpture in the atrium. Leave and return to Dearborn. Across from the Henry Moore, is an interesting building and plaza currently known as the Chase Bank Building. In the large plaza on the south side of the building off Dearborn, you will find a Chagall mosaic mural. Keep heading south and the northeast corner of Dearborn and Adams you will see a nice copy of Winged Victory of Samothrace, covered in gold, in a building atrium lobby. Across Adams, notice the twin Federal towers designed by Mies Van Der Rohe. On the east side of Dearborn is the Dirkson Federal Building which houses Federal trial courts and the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as many federal agencies. On the West side of Dearborn is the Kluczynski Federal Office Building and Post Office. in the plaza is a giant red Calder sculpture that resembles an ostrich made of I-beams with its head stuck in the cement! I do hope that you enjoy this little tour!",Daley Center,August 2016,30
Christkindlmarket Nov- Dec in Chicago,Anne Marie M,"The Daley Center hosts the best Christkindlmarket in probably the whole US. There may be some small ones around but nothing to compare with Chicago! It opens the Friday before Thanksgiving and goes through Christmas Eve & it's free!. This is the best place to buy handmade traditional glass Christmas ornaments. There are tons of other vendors selling food, mulled wine and other holiday items, traditional and new. Wear warm clothes, especially warm shoes or boots because it gets cold walking around for a couple hours. There is ample parking in garages close by.",Daley Center,November 2015,40
"Daley Center Farmers Market Thursdays May - Oct 7am - 3pm, Great place for lunch",EC145,"If you are in town, it is worth a visit to the market. You can pick up some food for lunch. In fact, today I bought a grilled cheese from Gayle's Grilled Cheese stand and forgot how incredibly good they are. You can pick up some local fruit for snacks. There is a fantastic soup stand, Karl's Craft Soups that I love because he sources from all the farmers at the market. There is a tofu, Phoenix Bean that has little boxes of prepared tofu salad, all made with truly, market fresh ingredients. Most of the farmers are from Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin. River Valley Mushroom has really good soups and there garlic cheese spread is decadent it is so good. There is a whole row of Amish vendors because of the Amish communities nearby. It is easy to buy lunch and have a picnic nearby and gives you a feel for the farms of the midwest.",Daley Center,August 2016,50

Heavy consumption by many on the mulled wine....and will say that one was just ok. pretzels...ok. potatoe pancakes...now will say those were pretty good.

Great Venue,applescruff909,"I saw Eels here in February of 2013, and it is a really great concert venue.  It's a fantastic space with good acoustics and visibility from throughout the house.  Small enough to be a cool, intimate setting for a concert while big enough not to feel cramped. It helped that the concert was amazing, but the venue itself had at least a little something to do with it.",The Vic Theatre,February 2013,50

You can just see the Bluesmobile imbedded in the plate glass.....,ColConnie,"Most people get their first introduction to the Daley Center when Jake and Elwood crash the Bluesmobile into it.  The building houses the legal offices of the city of Chicago and the municipal courts.  But it also serves as the lynchpin for Daley Plaza and a host of free activities year round.  From the kriskindelmarket in December to the spring farmer's markets to Chicagoween in October, the plaza never wants for activities.  Anchored by the enigmatic Picasso and a low fountain whose colors match the season, the mirth of the plaza is a counterpoint to the serious business in doors.  The building itself is a Skidmore Owings Merrill tribute to Mies van der Rohe and functionality.  Daley Center is located convenient to the subways and bus lines.",Daley Center,June 2015,40

Great alternative to driving,EJJourney,"Tips: 1. If there is a ticket booth at the station, get a ticket there or when  you buy one on the train, they will add a surcharge. (No surcharge if no ticket booth at station).  2. Once at Union, go to ticket counter right away to purchase return ticket to save time when returning (always shorter line by far this way. Long lines at the end of the day). 3. Train is often there 10 or 15 minutes early for the return trip, you can board and wait. It does pull out on time, so be warned. It does not arrive early in the suburbs, and it does not stop for long on the way in, just long enough to get the people waiting on the train. 4. Stop in the Great Hall (now a waiting/staging room for Amtrak) so worth the view. Daniel Burnham designed the station, built in 1925. Often decorated for the season. One year had a interactive player piano that was fun.  5. Lots of food vendors/convenience store/souvenir stores there. 6. Look for boards with info for line, track, and time info. 7. At rush hour, all escalators go one direction to facilitate the crowd. 8. There are bathrooms and outlets in some cars. 9. Have cash to pay for parking at the station in the suburbs, currently 1.25 at the 143rd stop. ",Metra - Commuter Rail,December 2016,50

"Excellent Service, Right On Time",bsandrs,"We took the Metra from the Millenium station out to Hyde Park, today, Sunday and it ran right on time. Comfortable seats and interesting views. On a sunny day, it was busy, perhaps because the timetable was reduced. It seems strange having a large, two level train stopping every couple of minutes, which speaks of busy times during the week. Make sure you buy tickets on line or at the station before boarding. Any tickets issued on the train attract an additional five dollar charge.",Metra - Commuter Rail,June 2017,50
the only way to fly,spinkick,Metra is the only way to go to the city. I usually ride the electricline from University park. This stops at Science & Industry Museum and the Field Campus.  Be careful to take Metra back and not the Southshore Line which goes to Indiana! Ends at Millenium station(bean) where you can take an EL train or bus etc. Coolers and liquids can be brought onto the train  and consumed if discret.

Do your research!,laurabedokis,My best advice is to do your research before using the Metra. We made it to our destination just fine but it could've been confusing if I'd not researched everything online. Research when your train leaves and know that not all stations have ticket counters. Download the Ventra app and purchase your fares on there and you'll avoid a $5 surcharge for purchasing tickets on the train. We purchased weekend tickets on the app so we could ride any metra we wanted to! Saved us a ton of money.,Metra - Commuter Rail,June 2016,50

I actually ended up leaving with my friends because the environment felt unsafe.  My friends got an apple strudel and it was served cold and wasn't even good.  I think that they could make this much better by charging admission and limiting the number of people that are allowed in at one time.  I would happily pay $20 or so to be able to look at the booths and not just get pushed forward by the crowd.  The place reeked like alcohol.",Daley Center,December 2017,10
"Reliable, Clean - Blast-from-the-Past",John G,"First, this was a great way to stay outside Chicago and get to center city in about an hour.  I rode it five round trips (Friday-Tuesday) and was only 5-10 minutes late coming out of town about three times; coming in anywhere from 5am-8:15am from the north was always on time.  The price isn't too steep ($73.75 for ten one way trips, Great Lakes to Ogilvie Town Center) was worth it, rather than compete with traffic and pay $14 an hour for parking.  The commuters are quiet, the conductors are business-like, and many of the stations are classic in appearance.  I recommend you download the ""Quick Track Chicago"" app to keep track on available trains and train progress along the route.  It would be nice if the app told me what track the train is leaving from at Ogilvie Town Center, but it's not too much hassle to check the monitors in Ogilvie.  If you're  hungry or waiting for a departure or arrival and want a place to hang out that's clean, adjacent, and orderly/safe with a couple of city police to help with security, there's a nice food court on the south end of the Ogilvie train platform with escalators up to the platform from the food court with train departure information monitors at the top of the escalators stating which track number the trains are parked on.",Metra - Commuter Rail,August 2018,50
Use the Ventra app to buy tickets,BoyMom22,"The Union Pacific West and Burlington Northern train lines are very safe and you should feel comfortable taking them to downtown Chicago.  Note that you should download the Ventra app BEFORE you get to the train station.  This is how you buy tickets. Sometimes when you are leaving Chicago you cannot even board unless they see your app.  Granted, you can sometimes buy tickets at the stations - but not all are open and there's a hefty $5 fine to buy on the train.  It's easy!  Just plan ahead and you are good to ride.",Metra - Commuter Rail,July 2018,40
Riding Metro Commuter Train,denisepH2200LU,"I had to use the Metra train to get to a very important family event. I used Metra from the 55-56-57th Street Station to Harvey, Illinois. This was the most COMFORTABLE ride I have had to travel. As my mobility is ltd, the biggest challenge was walking up so many steps to the platform. When the train approached, the Conductor was super nice to wait until I was able to get to the open car. He assisted me in determining the best stop for me to get off and he was exact in his suggestion. The ride was affordable,easy and comfortable. I often travel alone. I felt safe as well. These attributes were very important to me.",Metra - Commuter Rail,August 2018,40

Best Place to HEAR Music.,paintgirlchgo,Can't wait for another favorite band to show up at The Vic.,The Vic Theatre,October 2016,50
Great Venue,markrT7685WG,The Vic Theater is over 100 years old. While she shows her age she is a great and unusual place to see a show. All shows are general admission. Not a bad seat or place to stand in the house. I would recommend to any music lover. Seating is available upstairs if you do not wish to stand.,The Vic Theatre,October 2016,50
Intimate venue; good sound,Jenn S,"Sound is good and rich and seems natural. Not too loud, not quiet, but the dynamics were good. The theatre itself is old and it shows - the bathrooms need a serious updating (funny that the line for the mens' room upstairs was longer than the ladies' room line FOR ONCE.)",The Vic Theatre,October 2016,40
A Wonderful Venue For Music,Stevecation,"I saw a Marillion show here in October of this year and it was fantastic. The sound in this venue is really quite good considering it was built back in the Vaudeville Days. I questioned giving it a 5 rating because of the condition of the interior, but that just kind of added to the atmosphere. Nothing drastic, some paint peeling and some worn wood stains, all of which are to be sort of expected with a building this old. There were more seats up in the balcony area than I had imagined, maybe 200 and they were all good seats. It is an intimate atmosphere and again, with very good acoustics. We had no trouble with the area that it is in, which had several places nearby to grab something to eat and drink. Only a block away from a train stop. If you get a chance to see a performance you like in this venue, don't pass it up.",The Vic Theatre,October 2016,50

Great way for tourists to get to Chicago Botanic Garden!,BenLar137,"One of our goals in visiting Chicago was to experience the botanic gardens.  Thank goodness the train goes to the nearby Braeside Station!  We weren't travelling in rush hour, so things were pretty quiet.  Our train there and the one back were both on time. We found the train clean and easy to use.  We'd never seen trains with the open ""loft"" style upper seating area, but can see how practical it is when the conductors don't have to go up the steps!  And is the OTC ever nice!  Very modern!  The area on the other side near the markets had a bit more old-style charm, so it's hard to say which side we prefer. The only criticism we have is that we wish somehow they would integrate the Metra and the CTA ticketing - London England does an amazing job of this with the Octopus cards...",Metra - Commuter Rail,October 2018,40
Horribly Inconsistent,Amer K,"Getting on the Rock Island District from Tinley Park has brought nothing but distaste for this service. The trains are more consistently late than on time. This is especially true during the late fall/winter months. They frequently have very late trains due to unexpected delays that hold the train up by up to 40 minutes. The later the train you take the more true this becomes. They do a horrible job informing passengers and staff about any of this so you will show up to the train station at your expected time only to have to wait an extra half hour because of a delay you had no idea was happening. And if you planned on asking questions to the conductors or booth workers about arrivals, look somewhere else because they’re never informed of anything they go into it just as blind as we do. The Ventra app used to track trains is infrequently updated so there’s nothing you can do to see if a train will be delayed. If you’re a student who goes to a university in the city (IIT DEPAUL UIC LOYOLA) and your classes begins at 11:00am, you have no choice but to get on a train in the 8:00am hour to make your class on time. Overall I’m not even remotely fond of this service, I’d rather put the wear on my car from driving to the city daily ten times over than have to rely on this inconsistent sorry excuse for a commercial line",Metra - Commuter Rail,November 2018,10

Midnight Oil concert was fabulous!,DMack23,"I had not been to a show at the Vic in many years.  My husband, sister and I went to see Midnight Oil last night, a band I have waited 20 years to see in concert.  The tickets prices were reasonable for a general admission show, we got parking across the street through Spot Hero in the parking garage, also reasonable.  We were standing near the bar inside and deciding whether to try to get closer to the stage when we were approached by Jerry Mickelson, who said ""Are you all together?  I'm gonna put you in a box, follow me.""  And led us to the stage right upper box seating area!  THANKS, JERRY!  Wonderful little spot to see the show, sound was great, we had a server and it was a big, fun night, (though HOT up there)! Got out easily, kind of a long line to get out of the garage, but all in all, it was an awesoome night. :)",The Vic Theatre,May 2017,50

This one was in a nice neighborhood as far as I can tell.  I think the sound was good. I can't really remember the bar.  I took ubers to/from the airports at about $20-25 if I recall.  It's very convenient to City Suites hotel around the corner and I stopped in Big City Tap a block or two away and had 50 cent tacos (on Tuesday) and happy hour was $3 beers.

The train left on time and only took 30mins we made sure to jump on the Express every morning. The rate was reasonable for going into the city. Its gets super packed if you are a tourist so I recommend get to it 30mins early if you want to sit. If you don't want to share your seat go to the second story and it's all single seats. If you don't buy your ticket inside at the gate don't stress the have someone walking through selling and hole punching tickets just make sure you have cash.

Although the station name had changed, the Millennium station is in desperate need of upgrades and remodeling.  It looked exactly the same to me, with the exception of some new train boards at the platforms.  The station staff were all very friendly and helpful and the train conductors were nice and the trains ran on schedule.

The employees were OK until they announced that they were closing.  The employees get downright nasty then.  I understand they want to go home too but act like an adult.

I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that they had a museum of stained glass windows from different creators/designers that included Tiffany.

Another shopping alternative on the Magnificent Mile,Taylor B,"Visitors to Chicago and the Magnificent Mile are reminded that there are options for shoppers other than Water Tower Place. In fact, 900 North Michigan, located only a block away, was developed as an upscale sister to Water Tower Place as the second vertical shopping mall built along the Magnificent Mile. Built in 1989, 900 North Michigan is the eighth tallest skyscraper in Chicago at 871 feet tall. The centerpiece of the structure is 900 North Michigan Shops, a large, upscale shopping mall that is anchored by Bloomingdale's, which occupies the rear of the wide, six-story atrium, with other luxury shops and restaurants filling the remaining space. The unique arrangement of escalators in parallel, rather than in zig-zags, directs foot traffic past more shops. Offices originally occupied floors 8-29 but floors 21-29 were converted to condominiums in 2007, leaving offices on floors 8-20. The luxurious Four Seasons Hotel occupies middle floors 30-46 and 106 condominiums, or 132 East Delaware Residences, occupy floors 47-66. There also is a 12-story parking garage that occupies the rear half of the block, facing Rush Street. Aside from Bloomingdale's, other retailers at the 900 Shops include Gucci, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Atlas Galleries, Mario Trioci, J.

This one is a little better than most of them and is probably close to 100 years old.  There are seats in the balcony but standing only on the main floor.  Even the doors to the balcony and the bathrooms are narrow by today’s standards.  If you are a large person you might want to skip the balcony.

Scandinavian immigrants museum ,jasone20,It is a small museum packed with both sides of the history. The first floor is a gift shop and the reminders of the old pre-world war 2 puppet theater. Very cool.  The second floor is the heritage and genealogy center.  Mega cool. Didn’t go to the third floor. But that is the children’s museum. Sounds cool. Be sure to look at their website for free days for entry. But it doesn’t cost much to begin with.  And yes some of the museum involves the results of the Great Chicago Fire. Highly friendly staff.  And please leave donations as that is how museums like this survive. ,Swedish American Museum,October 2019,40

Love this festival,EagleTravel29,"This is the 5th year we have gone to the Jazz festival. We went 4 years in a row, starting with the year it moved to Millenium Park, skipped 2 years and then went this year. We noticed some changes. Overall, the music is fantastic and it is still free. We noticed they took down the tent at the Von Freeman stage and that was an improvement. However, we also thought there were fewer vendors in the arts area and reduced number of places to meet the artists. The biggest change is you get searched going into the festival, which we understand. The biggest change is you now can't bring alcohol into the festival which is a killjoy. Not that people were getting drunk, but it was nice to have a bottle of wine while sitting on the Pritzker lawn for the evening performances and having a picnic. It appeared that there were fewer people on the lawn, though still quite full. But the picnic atmosphere seemed a little dampened. Not sure if this change is due to the festival trying to get more revenue since the event is free, or just the park making a money grab. Having said all that, this is a great event and we will be back, but we do think the policy of bringing in your own drinks should be changed. There are other festivals there that do allow it.

It was fresh outside so we decided to pop in for a drink and we were so glad we did. The restored 1920s property is large but feels cosy, the view of the lake is stunning and the local brew was great. We were well looked after by Jay behind the bar who was very busy but attentive and took the time to tell us about the building and Chicago. Our only regret is that we didn’t have any food as it looked and smelled delicious.

Passwngers were required to disembark at Forest Glen, jam into a bus to take a 15 minute ride around the track work to the next stop at Mayfield. The rest of the train ride was uneventful.

Made it as far as the Prospect Heights station then broke down and it was packed with rush hour passengers.  Conductor was honest in that he did not know if it could be repaired...if the following train will push this one or whether we would all need to move to next train.  I had no interest in trusting this confusion and got off and took an UBER.  Paid my $7.75 for my Metra ticket and it cost me another $28 to get home.  GREAT REASON to never trust METRA again.

The centerpiece of the shopping mall is a six-story atrium. The anchor store is Bloomingdale's.

Unprofessional Staff ,SusiWitt,"The theater is old school cozy, which I love. My big issue is the way we were treated by security staff members. I am all for security, being treated rudely is not acceptable. They purposely split our group up, stopping the line just short of one of our group members, who had no ticket since they were on my phone. There were only four of us. Just exercising a tiny bit of power. Then the ticket collector acted annoyed that we had to wait for our one more person. Made a big deal about my purse not fitting in, even though it did if I closed it all up. If it’s raining, don’t bring an umbrella. They will tell you to leave them outside, no coat check either. We got to the event early to get first row balcony. Then were told we had to move because they were recording the event. We obliged, only to be shuffled from one security person to another. No one knew what was going on. Finally we were given seats, only to be told 10 minutes before the event that we couldn’t sit there either! Argued with us when we tried to explain that we were escorted to these seats. People were now sitting in our original seats and all that were left were seats WAY in back. Now we are 50 year old adults, not youngsters, so I was truly offended in the demeanor we were treated. Finally, they let us sit where they put us and did enjoy the show. Management really needs to address professional development. ",The Vic Theatre,May 2019,20
Poor Management and Rude Staff Ruin It,Nicole M,"I am so sad that I have to write this review. As others have said, the security and front of house staff really do not understand customer service or  safety. As someone who once worked venues, I understand the  importance of following procedure and protocol to ensure everyone's. safety. But there is a fine line between following clear written policy and really destroying someone's experience. My boyfriend who is always hesitant to go to shows with me went above and beyond to purchase us Monster Ballads Experience tickets to my one of my favorite bands. I was so excited for this event. We got to The Vic early to check in. We got a special (large) packet of swag. After waiting an extra 30 mins for entrance they told us and another couple that our purses were too big for entry. Thos is the standard Madewell Medium Transport Tote. They produced a strange wooden box and even though my bag squished easily to fit in it I was denied entry. No bag check, no empathy. No time to return home and come back. Just yelling at us about a website policy. One that only states no large bags. No dimensions are listed. These are folks who make TSA look nice. I always brag on the beautiful venues and great customer service that Chicago has to offer. The Vic has proven me wrong.

One of Chicago's oldest and most vibrant parks,Taylor B,"Drive along North Avenue between Western and Pulaski any day of the week and you are awed by the sight of Humboldt Park, its size and greenery and historic buildings and community gatherings. One of Chicago's 77 designated community areas, it is located on the West Side in a largely Puerto Rican neighborhood that is noted for its dynamic social and ethnic demographic change over the last 50 years. The 207-acre park is the centerpiece of the community. Named for Alexander von Humboldt, a German naturalist and geographer, the park features three major historical buildings--the Boat House, the Field House and the Historic Stables. The park was laid out in 1869. Over the years, the neighborhood was home to Scandinavians, then European Jews, then Polish, then Puerto Ricans, African Americans, Mexicans and other Latinos. In 1980, Puerto Ricans were the largest ethnic group in Humboldt Park. In 2001, they founded the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture. In 2009, they moved the museum into the historic Humboldt Park stables and receptory. It is the only museum of its kind in the United States. Originally completed in 1895, the stables and receptory is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a Chicago Landmark. The building's design highlights the Germanic character of the neighborhood in the 1890s and is a fanciful creation of various roofs, finials, brick and half-timbering. The park is bordered by North Avenue to the North, Western Avenue to the East, Pulaski Road to the West and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks to the South.",Humboldt Park,November 2018,50

I'm told that it's one of the best places in the world for birdwatching during the migration season and I believe it. When you get there, you won't believe you're in the middle of a huge city. Because it juts out into Lake Michigan, the birds using the shoreline for navigation stop there to rest and eat. The sound is amazing. When my older son was about six, he said, ""mom, I think we walked all the way to Africa!"" I even saw a hawk with a six-foot wing span fly right past me once. There are several different biomes (is that the right word?) within a small space, including forest, prairie and dunes. Also get beautiful views of the skyline.

LOVE! ,Love2Tarvel,This is a must if you visit Chicago!! The skywalk is amazing ! Beautiful breathtaking views. Loved it! ,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,November 2019,50
Amazing views,Kspeller,"Managed to get a slightly discounted ticket, so paid around $20 each to head up to the sky deck. I’d say that’s about right. The signage isn’t that great on arrival, there is quite a long walk to even get to the elevators, but there’s some facts and figures to keep you amused. It’s 103 floors up, in a very quick lift so prepare your ears to go! It’s pretty busy so you have to be patient as you make your way round each part of the deck to get decent pictures. They have images of the views so you can figure out what you’re looking at. And the views are incredible, particularly those over Lake Michigan. We were lucky with the weather though! My one complaint is the wait for the ‘The Edge’ glass viewing deck. It was at least a 45 minute wait and was a very slow moving so we gave up, which felt like a bit of a shame as the rest of the experience had been great. All in all, well worth a visit. ",Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,November 2019,40
"Breathtaking view, but kind of felt like cattle.",N4380SYtiml,"The signage to find where to go in the Willis Tower was easy to find and to follow.  I happened to go at night on a weekday, which meant that there was next to no line to go to the top. After a quick elevator ride we were able to get to the windows easily, but I can see how it could feel packed like sardines if it were busier. There was a short line to wait to get out onto the ledge and snap a few pictures. There are employees at each station with a 60 second timer for groups of four and under, and 90 seconds for more than four people. Then you're ushered back into the free roaming area to look out three of the directions of the tower. Another quick elevator ride down and you're free to eat at the couple restaurants, or leave from there. ",Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,November 2019,40
Views from top,sangeetadas,Sweeping city views from Willis tower is a must while visiting Chicago.

Wonderful tribute to American writers on North Michigan Avenue,Jo-Ann M,"I hadn't visited this new museum so I was not sure what to expect but was very favorable impressed.  There is a wall giving information on author landmark house tours.  A wall showing deceased American authors with photo, short biography, 2 other descriptions or quotes, updated screens with top 100 favorite authors and books, exhibits (Dylan when we were there), listing of upcoming events featuring authors.  The rooms were large and furniture comfortable.  The displays were of museum quality.  My impression is that future visits will have even more to see so I plan to visit again on my next visit to Chicago.  Note:  The museum is on the second floor of the building so is easy to miss among the rest of sights on Michigan Ave.",American Writers Museum,April 2019,50

So much interesting information, fascinating displays, featured exhibits (Bob Dylan when we were there) and my favourite, typewriters that you can either write your own story or add to someone else's... or type a letter to someone or just enjoy it. I had a wonderful conversation with a young man who had never typed on a typewriter and had no idea how they worked. There are word games to play, hilarious and inventive. I LOVED it.

I won't spoil it for you, just go and you'll be glad you did.  The only disappointment was the limited selection of items in their museum shop (which wasn't really a shop but a few shelves).

Basically you stand in the lobby, go up the grand staircase (not the spiral one), walk around the balcony, stand under the spiral staircase and go outside of the building. That's it.

Then walk down the entire height of the building and enjoy the ambiance of a wonderful old pile of bricks that makes you feel like you have stepped back in time!

worth a visit,gregoryngrinley,The Clarke House and Glessner House tour was very nice. Takes an hour each and you see both on the tour. Guide was great. Walking tour map of the area also on hand. The walking tour wasn't that great but it was a beautiful day for a walk. I've visited Chicago a zillion times over the years but I'd missed this area completely. Chinatown is within walking distance along with the red line train. A healthy walk but safe and all.

Chicago's other shopping mecca,Taylor B,"Everyone who visits Chicago is familiar with the Magnificent Mile, the shopping mecca on North Michigan Avenue from the Chicago River to Oak Street Beach that features Water Tower Place and the Shops at 900 and the Shops at North Bridge and Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus and Tiffany's and Burberry and Brooks Brothers and Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. Well, take a left at Oak Street and you're in Chicago's Gold Coast, Chicago's most prestigious shopping street, a short street from Michigan to Rush that is notable for its numerous luxury goods shops, upscale spas, international couture houses, local boutiques, restaurants and residences. Start at the Drake Hotel on the east side of North Michigan Avenue, across the street from Oak Street beach, where you can visit Chanel, Van Cleef and Arpels and Georg Jensen. Among the fashionable brands along tree-lined Oak Street are Barney's New York, Carolina Herrera, Armani, Escada, Harry Winston, Tom Ford, Jil Sander, Jimmy Choo, Kate Spade, Lanvin, Hermes, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Saint Laurent, Ted Baker, Vera Wang, Versace and Christian Dior. The famous Oak Tree restaurant is gone but the new Del Frisco Steakhouse at 58 East Oak, at the site of the old Esquire Theater, has emerged as a popular lunch spot for shoppers.

I have no idea (and didn't research) what the artist means by them but for me, being that it is a crowd without heads walking in different directions it reminds me of rush hour pedestrian traffic in a big city. The mindless grind of the modern city life in its full splendor. Now this sculpture is in Grant Park which is exactly the offset to the mindless grind of the loop so it is quite an interesting piece.",Agora Scuptures,December 2013,40

It's FREE,Metrox,There was no way I was going to miss this museum of photography due to its free entry so I wandered up from the main shopping area to the museum which is about halfway the distance of millennium park on the opposite side on the corner. The exhibition was on petcoke and the effects of this industry on the people and the surroundings. It was a very eye opening and thought provoking set of images. Really gets you thinking how large industry treats people like cattle. Absolutely no regard for wellbeing. It had quite an effect on me which is the sign of good exhibition.

The stage was easy to see even though I was at the back (did this on person).  Good acoustics.  Security was efficient.  My only complaint was the bar set-up.  I felt like cattle.  I don't think there is a better way based upon the size and layout, but it was a pain. I suppose it isn't the worst thing to make me wait a bit for a beer.

Makeshift concert site ,Irishstud,"Attended the Dave Matthews/Tim Reynolds concert here and was surprised by how makeshift the whole venue was.  The gates opened late for starters and they seemed confused about how to let people in.  The drinks are SUPER over priced!  Do not get the vodka and lemonade drink! The drink was small...had about one shot of vodka and cost $20...and the taste was like powdered lemonade..terrible!  Do not sit in the lawn..there are terrible views of the stage!  It is a poorly designed lawn space!  It isn't the easiest place to get to in the sense that if you take an Uber or taxi out there you can wait hours to get one on the way back.  We walked all the way back downtown to avoid that mess! In general it's a good place to have a venue, but it needs to be permanent and there needs to be a better way to get people out and home.  I love outdoor music pavilions, but this wasn't one of the better ones.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,June 2017,20
Dave and Tim,anlaley,"This was my first time visiting the venue and I was not overly impressed. I had big hopes since it is a smaller venue to see the acoustic show with a view of the city and the lake but was disappointed when all was said and done. I love Dave and always sit in the lawn at his shows. It's always a good view with great people and good times had by all. However, here I didn't feel that way. The view of the stage was lack luster and quite frankly if it wasn't for the big screens seeing them on stage wasn't always possible. Unlike most lawns where you watch from a hill, this venue's lawn is just flat ground. Drink prices were also really high. I partly expected this bc it's Chicago and unfortunately everything is too high in this city. The view of the lake and the city skyline were about the only redeeming qualities for this venue. If I return to the venue, I will probably only sit in the reserved seating, hopefully that area offers better views of the stage. ",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,June 2017,20
Concert,gjparker2016,"Don't go there. The concert ( Don Henley) was postponed because of weather. Then later he played a short set.

Concentrating on the exciting field of contemporary photography, the museum has never had an uninteresting show in the ten years or more that I've been going to it. On a more mundane level, there's no entrance fee and the exhibits are usually fairly short. You'll be in and out in less than an hour, enriched by a meaningful cultural experience and not a penny poorer--unless, of course you make use of the donation box, which you should!!",Museum of Contemporary Photography,September 2015,50
Small but exciting museum - and it's free!,Kim H,Our group spent 45 minutes touring an excellent exhibit of photography from North Korea.  This museum is free and was uncrowded when we visited making it a pleasant - and free - stop while touring Chicago.  ,Museum of Contemporary Photography,August 2015,50

Awesome place to see live music!,Dave Z,"Went to the Aragon for the first time, so I didn't know what to expect. When I bought the tickets they were GA.

Seats way to close together!,CathyKen2016,"The music is great and they offer alot of concerts to chose from.But seating is bad unless you sit in the raised sections. The last we went there we saw Goo Goo Dolls and sat in the bleachers, there were so many spiders that we actually left are seats and just stood in the open, everyone by us was complaining about them.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,July 2016,30
What would you do to attend a great concert?,Virginia A,"I recommend bringing your own snacks and a water bottle (sealed). Even the bottled water for sale is $7, and some of the adult beverages topped $30. Food likewise overpriced,",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,August 2016,30
Casual setting for an excellent concert!,S J,"We recently saw Ray LaMontagne at the FirstMerit Pavilion at Northerly Island.  It was so relaxed and casual (except for the rude fans behind us!)  I like the setting - it's right on the water, close to the Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum.  The chairs are packed in tight, but if you're sitting next to your significant other, it's cozy and quaint!  There's a good size main stage plus giant screens on either side.  And the bonus, we got to see the fireworks from Navy Pier.  The mixed drinks are incredibly overpriced - so save yourself some frustration, walk past the first set of stands and go to the wine stand.  Good pricing plus you get a plastic carafe to keep.  Definitely the better value.  I would love to see another concert there.  Side note:  We took an Uber so I don't know if parking was crazy or not.  It was easier getting out than getting in.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,August 2016,40
Wonderful Outdoor Venue,AlgernonofChrisKay,"My husband and I went to see Josh Groban in concert here last night. We were a little nervous about getting into and out of Northerly Island, but were pleasantly surprised at the ease of our voyage. We took public transportation (Bus 146) which delivered us right to the venue (only had to walk about 10 minutes to get there). Afterwards the same bus arrived to take us back to downtown Chicago where we then took a cab to the Metra station. The setting was beautiful, the acoustics wonderful, plenty of bathrooms. Folding chairs not great but oh well.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,August 2016,40
Check this out if you like photography,Marc G,"Due to the small place it will hold just one or two exhibitions, so if you like it or not totally depends on whether you enjoy these specific artists. The current one i got to see was something I really liked. ",Museum of Contemporary Photography,October 2014,40
"Small, but free",Kate43323,"This museum will not take long to tour, but the free entrance makes up for that. The pieces are well explained, and the staff is knowledgable. The prime location makes it easy to fit in a day of touring.",Museum of Contemporary Photography,August 2014,40
OK - needed more variety,dvkremk,We went to MoCP today and I was a little disappointed.  All the photos were by one photographer - and his choice of subject was not something that impressed me.  Price is right though (free - but they would appreciate a donation).,Museum of Contemporary Photography,December 2014,30
Great small museum,teddysdad,"We came here as an alternative to the big chicago museums and were very glad we did. The museum is free, with donations welcome.

Take Pause.....enjoy the scenery,YoginiKay,"What an excellent short stop. A great place to take pause from your busy day. The entrance is free. The Photography is excellent. Often times exhibits are photographs from local Professors of photography at the School of Art Institute of Chicago or the Columbia School of Photography.

I don't even use the bathrooms there they are always dirty! Its a nightmare to find a parking spot near by!",Aragon Ballroom,February 2015,40
Didn't get past the door,Erin A,"I have been looking forward to this exhibit on North Korea.  Unfortunately, it seems if your bag is too big, they want you to check it at the door behind their counter on the floor.  I was not comfortable doing that.  I left.  I was very disappointed.",Museum of Contemporary Photography,September 2015,20
Great Sounds with Terrible Views,trvwll,I recently attended a Jack Johnson concert at the pavilion. The audio was great but the lack of sloped seating kills the view. The drinks were overpriced compared to other venues.,Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,June 2017,30
Fun venue for music!,Derek S,"My wife and I went here to see Farm Aid in 2015. The venue was nice and spacious, plenty of room to spread out. There was nice views of the city and the sound was good as well. The downside was that because it is flat the sight lines are not that good if you are further back. Parking not super convenient but there is ample parking in walking distance.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,September 2015,40
Not worth it,teabop,"Just went last night to see Steve Winwood and Stely Dan. They were phenomenal. We arrived to the concert 5 minutes before the start time. We did not know it would take us 20 minutes to get through the security line and another 7 to find our seat because there were not enough people working. We missed almost 30 minutes of the show. Very upsetting. To top it off we paid for VIP seats. The seats were so small that we could not prevent having our arms and legs touch the folks next to us. It was 95 degrees! Very uncomfortable and I'm 105 pounds! The chairs cannot be moved because they are all tied together. We only bought one beer each because after spending $11 a can, yes $11, we just couldn't bring ourselves to buy anymore. I will not go there again to see a concert, when I can see amazing acts at Ravinia for cheaper and the seats are comfortable and spacious.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,June 2016,20

Mamabear101,bearfacts101,"Great old building. Loved the architecture. Bathrooms were clean with ample amount of stalls.  Way better then The Rave in Milwaukee.  They also sold bottles of water that you could actually keep with you instead of pouring it in a plastic cup, not giving you all the water in the bottle and charging $4.00.  Security was so so.  Would attend another event at this venue.",Aragon Ballroom,October 2016,30

"Interesting, but not worth running to.",RyanTravels24,"This museum took us about a half hour to walk to. Once we got there, we were intrigued by the photos and videos presented. Despite this, the museum was very small and there's much better bigger museums around. ",Museum of Contemporary Photography,June 2013,30
Free and unepected,SimsalabimTim,"Contrary to our expectation, the photos are not made by professionals and chosen for their beauty. In fact, there are collections of photos by ""normal"" people but they depict various occasions. For example, photos found in abandonded buildings were exhibited as were photos taken by the former sercret service of the German Democratic Republic.",Museum of Contemporary Photography,March 2014,40
I'll go back every time I'm in Chicago,MarcJNoMore,"I just happened to see this museum on the edge of the map my concierge gave me.  The place is just a couple of blocks from the Art Institute, and I like photography so I decided to check it out.  I am really glad I did.  It's a little unexpected gem.  There is no admission (but don't be cheap - donate $5 in the plexiglass box).  It appears to be staffed by students.  There are three small levels, but there were five different exhibits to see.  The main floor is the largest and accommodated two artists' photos on a similar theme.  The second floor had another small exhibit (which I found pretty compelling, photos of the artist's older mother as she slid into mental illness), another small exhibit on the third floor, and there were two video installations.  I spent a leisurely 45 minutes or so going through the place and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I will be going back every time I'm in Chicago (you can't spend all your time at the Art Institute, and this place is much more personal).",Museum of Contemporary Photography,April 2014,50
Worth a stop,NU49,"A part of Columbia College, MoCP is a small but lovely photography museum. Great exhibit that changes periodically. I've never found the staff to be particularly interested that we were there but that's OK as I go for the exhibits.

"Medinah Temple originally, a hidden gem in the city",Solarain,"This is a hidden gem in the city! From the outside, Bloomingdale's Home + Furniture is a beautiful old building that looks like a former Mosque. But it is a former Shriner's auditorium and was never used for religious services. It was once the home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Bloomingdale's put $60 million into renovation costs and kept the walls, stage, curtains and gorgeous stained glass windows intact. Everyone in the store is very welcoming and if you ask any of them about the building history, they are more than happy to explain and answer questions. We were directed to the Gift Wrap department on the 2nd floor, where they have beautiful brochures that tell the history of the temple. Seeing me with camera in hand, a clerk explained we'd really enjoy the women's bathroom! Funny looks on our faces, she said we'd want to be sure to take pictures. And take pictures, we did. The stained glass windows are on 3 walls, right in front of where you stand. Absolutely stunning! They have 2 glass cases filled with memorabilia and historical mementos on the 2nd floor of the building, worth checking out. Even though the store was for sales, they were happy to let us enjoy walking around to view the building's architecture. This was one of the highlights of my trip to Chicago. We were even entreated to a funny story of their $36,000 hand built mattresses.",Bloomingdale's Home + Furniture,April 2013,50
Outstanding home store located in an amazing space!,HubBubba,"Stayed across from Bloomingdale's during a recent trip to Chicago. Visited the store every day to check out the designs and architecture. The building is the Shriner's Medinah Temple. Can you believe that Sir Georg Solti recorded music there with the Chicago Symphony?! Thank you Bloomingdale's, Albert Friedman, and the City of Chicago for saving and transforming this amazing building! Recommend checking out every floor, including the bathrooms on the second floor (trust me), and trying out the luxurious beds and furniture on the third floor. Simple fun. PS- Stop by the Nespresso Boutique to sample a coffee and talk to the friendly and knowledgeable staff.",Bloomingdale's Home + Furniture,July 2013,50
"Another excellent, free museum",SherriandBrandon,"This is a small, free museum that is definitely worth checking out.

Dave Matthews concert,aeastridge34,"I thought it was a nice place. I had seats though.  People In the lawn were on the same level of surface as the seats so it was hard for them to see. Stayed at the congress plaza hotel 1 mile away. Nice walk to the venue.  Drinks are expensive but that's all venues. I would go back, just no lawn seats at this venue for me. Usually when I get lawn seats at amphitheaters it is on a hill so you can see everywhere.. not here though..",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,June 2017,50
Historic Venue perfect for concerts,MaddieH7,"We just went to the Sting concert here on Friday night. My parents used to talk about dancing here in the 1940's and 1950's. The Aragon has such history. Rehabbed a few years ago so not the pit that people say it is. Drinks are super expensive, but that is the sporting event and concert MO these days. Key to a seat in the balcony, if you so desire, is to get in line early and bolt up the stairs, which thankfully my husband does for us! We were in the first row balcony, dead center sight line. Perfecto! Plenty of street parking, also lots.",Aragon Ballroom,March 2017,40
Favorite Chicago concert venue.,Nautus,"As a southeast Wisconsite I find myself in the Chicago area more than locally due to the size of the city and the music talent Chicago unlike Milwaukee brings in. First time at the Aragon in 2009 and have now been coming back every year and very often as of late. I love this place, location, size, and decor and look. It's a beautiful place and love the live music sound here. Bands like NIN, Weezer, Deadmau5, Foals, Phantogram, Silversun Pickups and Andrew Mcmahon just to name a few. Don't hesitate to see a show here. And the L train literally right outside the door is a huge plus. ",Aragon Ballroom,May 2017,50

Great free museum with interesting exhibits,jjctraveler,"I visit this museum every time I go to Chicago.  On Michigan Avenue across from Grant Park at Columbia College, it offers a variety of exhibits that are always interesting and it is free (donations).  It is a multilevel museum with several stairwells, but I believe you can ask for assistance with an elevator if you can’t walk the stairs.  Please note that this is modern photography so some exhibits can be of an adult nature, but most are not.  The exhibits are hit and miss, some are stunning, some bore me.  But it is a great place to explore while you are in Chicago.",Museum of Contemporary Photography,May 2011,50
Hidden FREE gem,Alexis A,Another hidden FREE gem. Exhibits were interesting. Best when they're aren't too many people strolling through at once since several displays are placed in major walkways and stairways. ,Museum of Contemporary Photography,April 2012,50
Don't waste your time,CafeMocha,"We visited the museum in June 2012.  Admission was free -- good thing or else I would have demanded my money back.  The place is VERY small, even though it has two levels.  The first level had no photos at all -- just some video clips set on a loop that were not interesting at all.  Second level was not much better -- some very weak stuff on newsprint that barely qualified as photos.  Definitely a waste of time.  I feel sorry for anybody that paid money to study at the university that hosts this museum.",Museum of Contemporary Photography,June 2012,10

Awesome Brews!,bnmlr88,"While visiting Chicago I happened upon this unassuming brewery. The atmosphere was super laid back and welcoming.

If you're ever in Chicago you've gotta go to Begyle. ",Begyle Brewing,February 2016,50
Great local brewery,Joseph B,"The beer is great.  I could end the review right there.  But where this place really shines is it's neighborhood-centric vibe and tasting room.  Walking into this brewery rather than, say, Goose Island is like walking into your friendly corner pub rather than Barleycorn.  On a Sunday afternoon, there were plenty of seats and a very brief line.  There is no bar, it's just a counter from which you purchase beer, growlers, and schwag.  Said counter is staffed by people proud of their product and happy to discuss it with you.  I highly recommend you make a trip here!",Begyle Brewing,June 2015,40
Stopped in for a quick drink,ChristineD191,We stopped in to try a couple samples after a friend brought us a growler. Lots to choose from. I liked the bushel and peck and the dicey riley. We did samples for 2 or 2.50 each. Reasonable prices for pints and growlers too. You can play skeeball if you have time to stick around. Good ambiance and vibe. Love the wooden chairs and tables. They have card games and other games to help you entertain yourself.,Begyle Brewing,April 2016,50
Awesome small brewery,Shelliu,We were surprised at how great the beer was. One of the best Double IPAs anywhere and a very cool small taproom. Should be on any beer nerd's list. We will be back for sure. ,Begyle Brewing,June 2016,50

"Small Club Vibe, Big Club Sound",JakeDwyer,"Lincoln Hall is the best place in Chicago to see up and coming national acts in a small venue.

Saw three distinct acts including Blues and Hip - Hop blender ZZ Ward and Soulful , alt - country Delta Rae. Sat in the balcony and enjoyed several craft beers and listened like I was in a friends ultra decked out basement. Very comfortable with great sound on all levels.

Great Staff!!!,alexis e,I went yesterday to see one of my favorite artist. I go to standing room only venues all the time and this was by far the best one I’ve been to. I was in the front row and the security took care of us. They gave us water whenever we asked for it and just had friendly conversations with us while we waited for the stage to be put together for the next performer. Most security guards at venues like this are always angry and un friendly. I will be returning back for another show because I enjoyed myself and the friendly staff. The venue is huge. It takes place up a flight of stairs and the stage is a little high up.,Aragon Ballroom,March 2018,50

There's no direct way to get there from Navy Pier so if you want to get to the tip of the park to take pictures of the Chicago skyline, you have to walk all the way around. I saw a couple people with their dogs. It's got a nice open grassy area to play with them. The park also has some nice large fountains.

The opera house also can boast of a very capable team of ushers and attendants at the service and refreshment counters.  I have only attended operas here, so I can not speak to other uses, but with the operas, the capacity to balance voice and orchestra is as good as any in a house of this size.

Hopefully, they wont build more follow by this. Otherwise it won't look like Chicago anymore.",Lake Point Tower,July 2012,30
"An attractive building, but out of place",farmbrough,"I enjoy the design of this building. It was built in 1968 and at the time was the tallest block of flats in the world. Its shape is clearly a forerunner of the modern architectural craze of avoiding straight lines and anything that looks like a perpendicular, and cladding everything in functional or non-functional glass. I imagine the curves also help make it wind resistant, which must be a consideration for any building this tall standing on its own. A rather bitty appearance results from inconsistencies in the types of glass, differing reflectivities, or whatever is behind the glass, and this detracts from the overall elegance of the building. It is clear its design is like a typical hotel, where every apartment is to be sold or rented on the basis of the view afforded from its windows. Certainly this would be an unique view as there are no other high rise buildings round here, but that beggars the question ""why here?"" It does look rather odd in its solo position by the lake, and one wonders whether the planning policies at the time were swayed by a few judiciously placed brown paper envelopes. Still a good-looking building, by any standards.",Lake Point Tower,July 2012,30

Since it is small, you can take it in in no more than 45 minutes, depending on how much you want to engage with what you are seeing.

It is a great place for a walk - very peaceful and beautiful,O6378WFannag,"I was trying to prepare for this walk around the cemetery a day before but I couldn't find  any decent map of it posted on line. And later when I went to the administrative building at the cemetery I learned that they don't have any brochures for a self walking tour or neither any decent map with notables noted on it. So if you know someone and you want to find him/her on this cemetery you have to come prepared. (Well they can help you a little at the office but don't count much on them).  Do research on your own. You will not get much help at the cemetery unless you came with a tour guide. So for example if I didn't know that Sears, Shedd and Montgomery Ward are buried in the Mausoleum I would not be able to find them fast. Even if you know they are in the Mausoleum you have to spend some time to find them. When I came the front door to the mausoleum it was locked (and it looks like it is usually locked) . But you can get inside from the other side of the very long building - then you have to walk through all corridors back to the front of the original building where those listed above you can find). Remember that the Mausoleum is locked at 3:45pm....you might get lost within Mausoleum, because it is very long and it has 2 levels (for some it is like a labyrinth.

The Ghosts There Are REAL - I used to work there,Zoletta S,"I took a sales position there some twenty years ago, and there wasn't one of us who didn't at one time see or hear something 'ghostly,' if you will. On my part, I witnessed an other-worldly swirling haze, the height of a person, just behind one of the larger upright tombstones. It was quite peculiar, since it was in broad daylight in the middle of a perfectly clear and sunny day. It happened to be a grave that was recently disturbed from a large tree branch that had broken off and fallen during a lightning strike the week before. Then there were the voices. On many occasions, I was alone in the front office late at night, and I would hear men talking, like a roomful of young men, whispering from down the hall. It was almost like a low-playing tv, but nothing was ever there. One of the other salesmen, who was a tough-cookie no-nonsense military type, told me that when HE was alone in the office, someone called out his name at least three times. He said he thought it was someone playing a trick on him, and he was ready to beat their you know what, but just like me, after searching high and low, he found no one else in the building - and I'm talking after hours, when the doors and cemetery gates are closed, and the only car in the parking lot (the one for employees BEHIND the locked gates) is your own.",Rosehill Cemetery,April 2016,50

Home Shopping,FelBubu,Thre Bloomingdale's Home + Furniture is a very good store near to the michigan avenue (just two blocks....).,Bloomingdale's Home + Furniture,September 2016,40
Old Building,Clevlander,This is an old temple turned into a department store specializing on home and furniture items. Its very nice and complete with anything needed for a home. Nice espresso bar from Nespresso. I go there to get mine anytime I am in town.,Bloomingdale's Home + Furniture,November 2016,40
Must see interior,Octobertraveler31,This is a must see when in Chicago. The store occupies the old Shriner Medinah Temple where many high school graduations and circuses were held before McCormick Place was built. The original architecture and windows are preserved. Staff is happy to see visitors admiring interior. Lots of nice home items reasonably priced.,Bloomingdale's Home + Furniture,April 2017,50
Surprising architecture,TooOldtoRun,"While walking around Chicago and stopping at an intersection to wait for the crossing signal, I looked up to see a building with a very unique architecture. On investigation it turns out that it is now a Bloomingdales but started life as a Medinah Shiners temple. The inside has been converted to a modern (and very nice) store but the exterior retains its middle eastern look. If you're in the neighborhood, take a look.",Bloomingdale's Home + Furniture,July 2017,40

A surprising little oasis,AnaBaile,"We just happened upon this little park as we were heading to Navy Pier.  Compared to the bustle of many other well-known parks and attractions, this was a quiet peaceful spot.  There is a nice walkway and we saw several people walking their dogs.  Down below is a small sandy beach.   It wasn't swimming weather, but there were people enjoying wading.  As one proceeded down the walkway, the city skyline was visible with an unobstructed view.  To see that beautiful skyline with the magnificent blue of the lake in front of it...highlighted by the fall colors and then a sprinkling of sailboats...a scene I will never forget. If you need a little respite, this could be the place for you.  No playground, no bells and whistles, just a little peace.",Milton Lee Olive Park,October 2015,50

"""The Gilded Age"" of Chicago history",Taylor B,"If you are a historian or are fascinated by the Gilded Age or possess an inquiring mind about Chicago's history, you have to start at the Prairie Avenue Historic District, or what is left of it. Just to imagine what it was like in the 1800s is enough to make the trip worthwhile. It is a historic district in the Near South Side. It includes the 1800 and 1900 blocks of South Prairie Avenue and the 1800 block of South Indiana and 211-217 East Cullerton. Few are aware that it was the site of the Battle of Fort Dearborn. But most are aware that Prairie Avenue became the city's most fashionable residential neighborhood after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and designated a Chicago Landmark in 1979. The street has a rich history from its origins as a major trail for horseback riders and carriages. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-block section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section also was known for grand homes. Mansions for George Pullman, Marshall Field, John J. Glessner, John Sherman and Philip Armour anchored the neighborhood of over 50 mansions known as ""Millionaire's Row."" They were designed and built by many of the leading architects of the day. However, in 1885, after Potter and Bertha Palmer built the Palmer Mansion that anchored the Gold Coast at 1350 North Lake Shore Drive, the elite residents began to move north. Today, the Glessner House at 1800 South Prairie Avenue is the focal point of the district. It has been restored as a historic house and museum and is open for public tours. But you can still stroll the neighborhood and observe some of the late 19th century buildings that have been preserved, including the Henry B. Clarke House and the Second Presbyterian Church. Marshall Field lived at 1905 South Prairie and purchased 1919 South Prairie for Marshall Field Jr. Others are the three-story William Wallace Kimball house at 1801 South Prairie and the Coleman-Ames mansion at 1811 South Prairie. In 2007, the Marshall Field Jr. mansion, which had been vacant for 40 years, was renovated and converted into six private residences. Interestingly, Prairie Avenue is undergoing a redevelopment that includes One Museum Park at 1215 South Prairie, the tallest all-residential building in Chicago. Even the Potter Palmers, who were among the great visionaries of their era, didn't think of anything so grand.",Prairie Avenue Historic District,January 2015,50
HOW DID I MISS THIS!!,02wonderful,I'm still amazed that it's so close to the drab McCormick Place. I really am. You'd never know it exists unless you were told or happen to stumble upon it while trying to get back to your convention. Either way some of the buildings were so pretty. And it's so sad to think they could've been torn down. Go. Check out the old Chicago. You will enter a different country for an hour.,Prairie Avenue Historic District,March 2015,50
Afternoon explorations,PatS869,a wonderful area to explore and see the Chicago of the past.  There are several house museums to visit in the area.,Prairie Avenue Historic District,May 2015,50
A delightful place to discover Chicago's history,dvkremk,"We thoroughly enjoyed our walk around the Prairie Avenue District.  We printed off a PDF brochure of the neighborhood (found on the Glessner House website - under the Tours tab and on the bottom of the left hand green box).  The brochure provided a map, a history of the area and a short summary of each of the remaining 27 houses/buildings that were highlighted.  If you see all it is about a 1.5 mile walk - which is very enjoyable.  We enjoyed looking at the variety of structures.  You can visit the insides of the Glessner House Museum, Clarke House Museum, Second Presbyterian Church, Chicago Women's Park and Gardens and Chess Records.  Check the brochure/website for days and times.  It is a very enjoyable neighborhood to visit and there is much to learn about the city of Chicago.  We were in the area for about 4 hours (went on tours of Glessner, Clarke and 2nd Pres) - and didn't see everything.",Prairie Avenue Historic District,July 2015,50
Turn of the Century Delight,Madachoo,"Great glimpse into the bygone, turn of the century Chicago, buried amid all the new, shiny apartment towers.  A little off the beaten path but just a short cab ride from downtown.  Even a nice walk on a beautiful summer day. See the early traces of architectural styles that would make Chicago famous.  The Glessner House Museum is quite interesting...one of the first ""turntable"" garage mechanisms.  Even just a stroll down the street is worth the visit.",Prairie Avenue Historic District,October 2014,50

Theater on the river,Daniel A,We first saw this magnificent building when we were on an architectural tour on the Chicago River. It was sitting there like a diamond in the rough. We then had to check it out. We didn’t have time to watch a show there but we were still allowed inside to check out the grand building. It was massive and I’m not sure it would be a great venue for a show but it was special in terms of architecture. It would be fun to watch a show here just to say you watched a show here.,The Lyric Opera House,June 2017,40
A House with a Name! And it's Elegant. But no bags please.,SteveBliss,"Nevertheless, enjoy the room. It is quite confortable. But don't bring any bags!",The Lyric Opera House,November 2016,30
One of the few US grand opera houses,desrlmt,"I only visit opera houses when I'm going to Grand Opera, and I can't quite imagine how any other of the performing arts would fit. It seems to me that the opera and the opera house are inextricably linked. I've seen no better pairing than Chicago's Civic Opera House and Lyric Opera of Chicago. It's a magnificent form of virtual reality, in being transported for three hours or so to the finest form of entertainment of the 18th and 19th centuries. If possible, go early and stay after, so you can wander a little among the various levels of the theater and gain close-up appreciation of the fine architectural detailing that's not much repeated in modern structures. One warning: Plan to drink only water while you're there; alcoholic concoctions on offer are pricey and little more than water themselves. Do you think that happened in the 18th and 19th centuries?",The Lyric Opera House,October 2017,50

Tower,irina g,"Any city has some prominent landmarks that may be not that outstanding from the architectural standards of finesse and beauty, but they still are the significant part of the city and its modern history. In London, it is the famous Center Point, in Chicago it can be Lake Point Tower. Why not?  It looks quite impressive from any angle, sort of like a gigantic light-house (dark-colored), quite important and necessary for us and the city. Very ageless and photogenic, at that.",Lake Point Tower,March 2017,50

As part of Columbia College, they do need to expose students to the very best, so this museum does fill that gap.  Our suggestion would be to have a few permanent pieces on display that cover the full range of photography, yet still have exhibits that are leading edge, or are important historically.",Museum of Contemporary Photography,October 2018,30
The world's premier college art museum dedicated to photography,Taylor B,"Founded in 1976 by Columbia College in Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Photography has become the world's premier college art museum dedicated to photography. As an international hub, it generates ideas and provokes dialogue among students, artists and diverse communities through ground-breaking exhibitions and programming. Located at 600 South Michigan Avenue, the museum's mission is to cultivate understanding of the artistic, cultural and political roles of photography in the world today. Beginning in the early 1980s, the museum began collecting photographic materials. Since then, its collection has grown to include nearly 15,000 objects by over 1,500 emerging and mid-career artists. The museum houses this collection as well as the Midwest Photographers Project, which contains portfolios of the works of photographers and artists who reside in Illinois and other midwestern states. The permanent collection focuses on American and International photography of the 20th century and today. It includes work by Ansel Adams, Harry Callahan, Henry Cartier-Bresson, Julia Margaret Cameron, Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Irving Penn, David Plowden, Aaron Siskind and Victor Skrebneski among the thousands of photographs and photogenically related objects, including gelatin-silver prints, color work, digital pieces, photograms and various alternative processes. Of the museum's exhibitions in recent years, notable ones have included: Paul Shambroom's Evidence of Democracy; Michael Wolf's The Transparent City and Work/Place; and Guy Tillim's Avenue Patrice Lumumba.

Poor Seating; Poor Sound; Pathetic Venue,Ryan J,"I’ve been to concert venues all over the US, but this “amphitheater” takes the cake for being the worst. Both sections of reserve seating and lawn were completely level meaning that, unless you 6’-5”, You will be staring into the head of the person in front of you. Worst of all the sound was atrocious. The speakers went in and out from being over modulated to a muddled mess. If you love speakers that sound like they were ripped directly from a beat up Oldsmobile next in line for the crusher, then this amphitheater is the perfect venue for you.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,July 2018,10
Back to back nights there,MelindaIllinois,"Just spent 2 evenings therr for DMB concerts.  Really don't like the venue at all. Very poor viewing!!! Not steep enough incline to see over anyone's heads. We had decent seats, section 309,  and of course stood the entire concert with everyone else. I could only see the big screens. Would not go back to see a concert here again. Oh yeah, a beer was $13.75.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,July 2018,20
Stage on a parking lot,Hik3r,"Saw DMB here on 6/30.  The show was amazing, but the venue is pretty bad.  We were aware from reading reviews that the “pavilion” seating wasn’t covered, and the rows of zip-tied folding chairs aren’t unique; lots of uncovered outdoor venues use that system.  However, this venue sets seating up on what is basically a flat concrete pad, so there are no sight lines.  I’m fortunate enough to be tall, but there’s no way anyone behind me could have seen the stage; there’s really no incline at all.  I was really glad we didn’t have lawn seats, since the “lawn” was really behind a VIP stand.  The sound would have been fine for a standard four or five piece, wall-of-sound rock band, but was far too muddled for a group with as many layers as DMB.  The logistics around the venue were the worst part, though.  Vendor areas create a bottle-neck to enter/exit the venue, and the location itself is nothing but a bottle-neck for traffic.  After the show, the crowd was funneled out to the parking area and all the way to Grant Park at Michigan Avenue to catch any ride sharing or cabs, sending a lot of drunk people into traffic.  We’ve been to a lot of outdoor venues over the years, and this was without question the most amateur setup we’ve ever seen.  The entire venue experience just seems like an afterthought slapped on whatever piece of land happened to be available.  The city’s own pavilion in Millennium Park is far better.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,July 2018,20
Terrible venue,LoveChicago,"Then there's the parking garage, $30 for a garage that used to be free for ticketholders.

Beautiful Historical Building,Alysia R,"I attended Roosevelt University Chicago when I was an undergraduate music student, so I visited the Fine Arts Building (right next door) almost on a daily basis (for choir rehearsals and to buy music scores from Performer's Music). As a student, I never really appreciated the architecture or history of the building. However, this past autumn, I got a chance to visit the building again, and it was really nice to appreciate the building as a tourist. The design is beautiful, they still have old, manually-operated elevators (scary but fun), there are many interesting studios and shops on each floor, and the art hanging on the walls are just exquisite. I dropped by during the Open House Chicago event, so the Studebaker Theatre (which is currently closed) on the main floor was open to visitors and the Venetian Court on the 4th floor was open as well. Both were really cool to see! I advise that you come by for a visit if you love and support the arts, or just want to see a wonderful building from a bygone era.",Fine Arts Building,October 2014,50

The show itself was standing room on the lower floor with an upper balcony (closed off for this particular show). Additionally, I really have to hand it to the staff for making quick  set changes. The wait between bands was really minimal. There's parking at several garages nearby and I used a parking app to reserve a spot ahead about 2 blocks away. Super easy and convenient.

Chicago's largest cemetery,Taylor B,"My wife and I love to visit cemeteries, historic cemeteries such as Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington DC and Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. Chicago has its share of historic cemeteries, including Graceland, Rosehill and Oak Woods. Graceland, on Clark Street between Irving Park and Montrose, near Wrigley Field, is the most celebrated. But 350-acre Rosehill is the largest. Located at 5800 North Ravenswood Avenue, in the Lincoln Square neighborhood, it was established in 1859. The famous entrance archway was added in 1864 by designer William Boyington, who would go on to create many other well-known Chicago landmarks, including the Water Tower pumping station on Michigan Avenue. Boyington is buried in Rosehill. The elaborate Joliet-limestone mausoleum, the largest in Chicago, with windows by Tiffany, was added in 1914. Rosehill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and later designated a Chicago Landmark. It is the final resting place for hundreds of soldiers, 14 generals and six drummer boys of the Civil War, 13 Chicago mayors, business tycoons and other notable city figures. It also features an imposing firefighters memorial. Also noteworthy is the sculpture of Frances Pearce and her infant daughter Frances Pearce Stone entombed in a glass box. Among the notables buried in Rosehill are Illinois governors William Stratton and Richard Ogilvie, hot dog mogul Oscar Mayer, philanthropist and Shedd Aquarium founder John Shedd, Western Union founder Elisha Gray, car rental pioneer John Hertz, Sears Roebuck & Co. founder Richard Sears, Montgomery Ward founder Aaron Montgomery Ward, puppeteer and Kukla, Fran & Ollie creator Burr Tillstrom, bicycle company foundere Ignaz Schwinn, shoe company founder Milton Florsheim, U.S. Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage, Hall of Fame sportscaster Jack Brickhouse, advertising agency founder Leo Burnett, real estate tycoon Charles Hull, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Jerome Burck and Hall of Fame sportswriter Jerome Holtzman.

Unbelievably underrated. A MUST for blues fans,fender4life,"The guided visit is a must, I just can’t imagine what this place would be like if associated, say, with the Smithsonian....",Chess Records,June 2019,50
"If you love blues, you need to go here",DianaP1548,Specifically went as we are blues fans and were overwhelmed by the most excellent tour and sampling of music; historical knowledge is abundant and the feeling that you are in the same place as so many fabulous musicians and esp. Willie Dixon.  Brilliant. ,Chess Records,July 2019,50
Poor tour of great importance.,El_Loco_Ness,"This location is of immense importance, it's too bad the presentation isn't better.  I was happy just to sit in the main studio and feel the vibe. It's surprisingly quite reverby, but, it has also increased in size, lengthwise by about 10 more feet than the original.  No pictures allowed. Motown allows pictures, what's the big deal? Sadly, No original equipment to see. Shouldn't be too hard to find similar era equipment and make it look the same. The tour guide wants you to know that it is through Willy Dixon's altruism that the studio is here to help people. I have no idea what this means, or do I see any evidence of helping others achieve their musical goals. What's that all about anyway? Mentioned numerous times. Sigh.",Chess Records,September 2019,30
If you are into music and its roots this is a must!,MichaelE9,"This is an hour long tour led by a gent named Manchester....he is very knowledgeable and passionate about the history of Chess and the music created there. The space is historical and vibrant.  You can close your eyes and imagine Etta James, Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy or The Stones and a host of studio musicians walking around and recording there.  Hopefully it will reopen as a working studio soon.. A Chicago gem!",Chess Records,September 2019,50
A great piece of Blues and Rock & Roll history,Randy D,"Visited on Saturday afternoon Nov. 2. Our tour guide was a professional musician from Manchester. His enthusiasm was infectious and his knowledge was vast. As a fan of the Blues and R&R history it was a bucket list item for me but my son-in-law got quite a bit out of it as well so there's something for everyone. It's worth the time to go and they have a nice little gift shop with some great memorabilia spread throughout the venue. I made a small donation to the restoration of Studio B where some of the most iconic songs of our time were recorded, I hope that the successful artists of today will pitch in and make this happen. Thanks to the Dixon family for preserving this gem, it is a highlight of Chicago that they should promote much more!",Chess Records,November 2019,50
Horrible Sound System!,LoriD2222,"This was my first time here and my last. You couldn’t understand one word the  performers sang. General seating tickets means you stand for the concert.

Excision,Agballroomsuxs,I seen one of my favorite artists at this venue. And I had to buy a resale ticket so it was it was expensive nonetheless totally willing to spend a pretty penny. To see one of my favorite artists. And from the moment that I got to the door it was just a God awful terrible night. Between the terrible staff that they have there and the unwillingness to try to cater too realistic wants a very large number of people that visit that establishment. I will never go back and I hope they go out of business,Aragon Ballroom,September 2019,10
Awesome venue!!,redtomatobone,"Saw Lizzo here last weekend - we paid extra to have loge box seating.  Our loge box (11B) was just me, my wife and 2 other people.  there were 4 chairs available - I chose to dance rather than sit.  They do sell loge standing room only which is behind the loge boxes - I would not recommend this as anyone standing behind was obstructed by my standing during the entire concert.  Sorry to those behind me ... but you try to sit during a Lizzo concert!  ",Aragon Ballroom,September 2019,50

Chicago's most prestigious shopping area,Taylor B,"Oak Street isn't as celebrated as North Michigan Avenue, more commonly referred to as The Magnificent Mile, but it is to Chicago what Rodeo Drive is to Beverly Hills and Worth Avenue is to Palm Beach. Oak Street, a short street in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood, is the most prestigious shopping street in Chicago. It stretches for one long block runs on the Near North Side. It is located at the northernmost end of North Michigan Avenue, across the street from the Drake Hotel. Its eastern end is North Michigan Avenue. For discreet shoppers, its western boundary is Rush Street. It houses the highest concentration of luxury fashion brands with a mixture of international couture houses, American luxury brands, fashion brands and local boutiques, more high end brands than North Michigan Avenue, although it is perceived as an extension of the Magnificent Mile. In contrast to North Michigan Avenue, however, Oak Street is much narrower with trees lining both sides of the block, giving it a more intimate setting, with less foot traffic. Due to the short length of the street, new shops have overflowed onto the intersecting Rush Street and nearby Walton Street. Fashion brands on or near Oak Street are Barneys New York, Buccellati, Bonpoint, Brunello Cucinelli, Calypso St. Barth, Carolina Herrera, Christofle, Giorgio Armani, Escada, Eskandar, Furla, Christian Louboutin, Dior, Georg Jensen, George Greene, Graff Diamonds, Hermes, Harry Winston, Ike Behar, Jil Sander, Jimmy Choo, Kate Spade, Dolce & Gabana, Loro Piana, Marilyn Miglin Institute, Marc Jacobs, Paul Stuart, Prada, Saint Laurent, Ted Baker, Tom Ford, Tory Burch, Van Cleef and Arpels, Versace and Vera Wang.

Inside it looks like a department store, but the interior walls still have the character of the Temple especially on the third floor and its ceiling and domes.

Neighborhood Is Marvelous - Glessner House Is a Treasure,Eric W,"I wrote separate reviews for both the Glessner House (1880s) and the Clarke House (1830s).  These adjoin the Chicago Women's Park and Gardens.  Prairie Avenue as a neighborhood preserves some of the original properties that were missed by the Chicago Fire, survived the industrialization of this area near the railroad tracks, Depression and then salvaged while many mansions were razed.  The Clarke House was relocated from another location and restored.  The Glessner Hourse remained in one family until obtained by a professional architect's association and then turned over for restoration.  I recommend you allot at least four hours to do a walking tour of the neighborhood, check out the lake and skyline view from a hidden park east of Prairie Avenue, and make the most of the tours and docents at the two houses.  One final treasure is the Women's Park and Garden itself, including a compelling statue honoring Jane Addams.  My wife is a social worker, so this was meaningful.  And our church dedicates a special week of service we call:  ""God's Work. Our Hands."" See the attached photo.  Jane Addams is honored in this tribute to loving loving and dutiful hands.",Prairie Avenue Historic District,October 2017,40

Recalling when Prairie Avenue was Chicago's most prestigious address,Taylor B,"In the late 1800s, Prairie Avenue was Chicago's most prestigious address, home to some of the city's richest and most famous people, including George Pullman, Philip Armour, Marshall Field, John Glessner, William Wallace Kimball, Gustavus Swift and Potter Palmer. Historically, the north-south thoroughfare on Chicago's South Side extended from 18th Street to 22nd Street. Today, only 11 residences have survived from the district's glory days. Visitors can sign up for a walking tour of the district at the Glessner House Museum or can explore on their own. A two-block section of the street forms the core of the Prairie Street Historic District, which is designated as a Chicago Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It covers the 1800 and 1900 blocks of South Prairie, the 1800 block of South Indiana and 213 through 217 East Calumet. The district is anchored by two famous buildings: the Clarke House at 1827 South Indiana and the Glessner House at 1800 South Prairie. The Clarke House is the oldest surviving building in the city, dating to 1836, but it was moved to its current address in 1977. The street's heyday was short-lived. Palmer moved to the North Side and friends followed. The first factory arrived in 1915 and many grand homes were turned into rooming houses after World War I. As the neighborhood became more commercial, most of the houses were torn down. Not much remained by the time Prairie Avenue became a Chicago Landmark in 1979. Today, it's a book of old memories of a glorious era in Chicago's history.",Prairie Avenue Historic District,November 2018,50

First timers to the Lyric Opera House,snickes,"We made a last minute decision to go see West Side Story.  The website was easy to use to buy tickets online.  We picked the ""cheap seats' at the top in row ""O"" so I was a little hesitant as to what it would be like.  Fortunately, the acoustics were excellent and we could see the performers fairly well.  The seats were comfortable and angled enough so that I had a good view of the stage.  The first half of West Side Story is much longer than the second half so play any needed restroom breaks accordingly!  Also, they had a photo booth in the lobby area which was fun and free and you get a physical picture right there and they email one to you as well.  If you are driving to the Lyric Opera house, they offer discounted parking in the Poetry Garage less than 2 blocks away.  We went on a weeknight and for 3pm arrivals and after, it is only $12 but you must order ahead of time on the Lyric Opera website.   For comparison, Spot Hero was running around $20 for similar parking.  Additionally, for those not familiar with the surrounding area (us!), we had a lovely dinner at South Branch Tavern Grill (excellent Mahi Mahi tacos!) and it was only a few blocks away.  We made an Open Table reservation and I requested patio seating. They put us in a booth right on the river where we could watch the boats go by.  We were then going to take the water taxi to go exploring as it is right across from the Opera House, however we decided to save money and just walked around the Loop area on foot.  Upon our return back to the Lyric Opera House area to attend the show, we were a few minutes early so ducked into Rivers Restaurant right near the theater for a drink before the show. They had a nice patio by the river as well but it was full so we just sat inside which felt great after a busy few hours playing tourist.  We left the restaurant around 6:30 to walk over to the Lyric Opera House; get through bag security; get our tickets scanned; get a photo taken; and find our seats.  Everything was perfect and made for a memorable night out!  Exiting the show was a breeze and we were with a mass of people in a well lit area heading to the same parking garage so I felt very safe.  There was a delay getting out of the parking garage due to everyone leaving at the same time but that was to be expected.",The Lyric Opera House,May 2019,50

Paulette a credit to the Lyric....and to Chicago,Vanyaviews,My partner and myself visited the Lyric as part of an Open House weekend to marvel at Chicago’s many architectural wonders. I happened to get into conversation with an employee of the Opera House called Paulette. She was wonderfully engaging and knowledgable about the Lyric and about Chicago more generally. Paulette was extremely generous with her time and so courteous with visitors. She is a credit to the Lyric and to Chicago and made me fall even more in love with this wonderful city.,The Lyric Opera House,October 2019,50
on a limb,ian_dempster,"This tower is opposite Navy pier but seems out on a limb to myself. It seems unattached to the rest of the skyscrapers around,",Lake Point Tower,September 2018,30
One of Chicago's most unique skyscrapers,Taylor B,"Chicago boasts many landmark buildings, from residences to skyscrapers, but perhaps none of them is more distinctive than Lake Point Tower. It is one of the first structures you notice when flying in or out of Chicago or driving north or south on Lake Shore Drive. Its distinct shape and location make it a remarkable landmark. Its design was futuristic at the time of its construction. Even today, the 1960s tower still looks modern. Located at 505 North Lake Shore Drive, near the Lake Michigan Bridge and Navy Pier and the Chicago River, Lake Point Tower was designed by John Heinrich and George Schipporeit, students of Mies van der Rohe. It was partially derived from a sketch that van der Rohe made in 1921. The building was completed in 1968 and, at the time, was the tallest apartment building in the world, reaching a height of 645 feet. Over the years, my wife and I have visited friends who lived in the building and we were always awed by the spectacular views of Lake Michigan, the shoreline and downtown Chicago. Because of a city law, developers are prohibited from constructing another building near Lake Point Tower. Hence, residents will always have a view unlike any other.",Lake Point Tower,December 2018,50

To the right were really interesting pictures of people.  I loved that you could see the texture and color of the skin.  They also had a story to tell.

"Great venue, access a little limited",quinnmccolly,"We were there for a kids festival/concert (Nick Slimefest). Overall the lines/crowds weren't bad but that may have related more to the turnout of the show.... we had some rainy weather and the sod gets very water logged and fairly muddy pretty fast. Stage setup and grandstands were nice and they do a nice job of how they handle food vendors. Getting there.... we cabbed over from Michigan, but drivers don't always want to go all the way down the road into the bottleneck so we jumped out and took bike rickshaw thing. It was about 20 bucks from the field add that to the cab ride and you are at about the same cost as the parking lot. The lot is super-close, but I imagine tough to get out of if you stay at the show until the end. Gate/security folks were friendly and overall we had a good experience. I would go back.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,June 2019,50
I give this venue a hard pass,winehikingdiaries,"I attended a concert here for the first time and walked away completely underwhelmed by the venue and management. There's a lot of potential here. I mean, the location is right off of the lakefront with the city skyline lit up behind us. We sat in the 200 section and I honestly couldn't see the stage the entire concert. I could barely see the jumbo screens. Whoever designed this venue didn't think about sight lights. Everything (except for the very back seats) are on the same level, so unless you are super tall or standing in the front row, you'll never see anything. The staff here doesn't help or do anything to prevent people from stealing seats. Our whole row was a big mess because of people sitting in seats that weren't theirs but there was no one to enforce it so it felt like a free for all. The seats are just plastic folding chairs, but hardly any of them are actually labeled with a number. Some have labels, others were so worn down you couldn't read them, and other chairs had no labels at all. This added a lot of confusion about how to find your seat. The labels are literally just stickers, so I feel like the venue is being cheap about not maintaining that. Concessions were way overpriced (but I guess I expected this) and the lines were too long for me. People next to us went to grab a cocktail and they said it took them almost 45 minutes. Lastly, there was a small, brief storm that happened right at the beginning of the concert so they asked everyone to seek shelter in the parking garage while it passed. I have no problem with them trying to keep everyone safe, but their communication was ambiguous and no one had any idea if the concert was even going to happen. They just kept posting tweets that they were monitoring the weather. The concert ended up being over 2 hours delayed, one of the acts was cut, the other (the band I came to see) had their set reduced from an hour to 20-30 minutes. Again, weather is weather, but we waited in a parking garage for 2 hours until they could even tell us if the concert was happening. When they finally tweeted (not texted or called their patrons) all 30,000 fans were being corralled into the venue at the exact same time (gates opened 15 minutes before one of the 2 headlining bands started to perform). It took us almost an hour just to get to our seats. It was complete chaos and didn't seem like they had enough people working to keep people moving through security. I feel like they should have either rescheduled or canceled and offered a refund but no word on that. This is an outdoor venue, bad weather is going to happen, and I feel like they could improve their systems and communications for future weather related incidents. No one walked away happy from this concert to no fault of the musicians.",Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,June 2019,20
Northerly Island,ryantell30,My biggest drawback every time I am there is what a huge opportunity the city missed with this venue.  This could have been one of the most beautiful and iconic music venues in the country with the lake naturally painting the background...the spot was begging for a gorgeous theater.  Instead they phoned it in and erected one of the most uninspiring venues in the country and somehow managed to make it worse when they added an unsloped lawn.  This has the potential to be a destination music venue for people around the country and even the World..hopefully Chicago can figure this out one year.,Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island,June 2019,20
Underwhelming and dirty venue,mercur05,"The venue could be so much better, in so many ways. I wish the city leveraged the proximity to the lake and skyline. Instead, you can't see the lake or the skyline. Seating is simple folding chairs and the seats are poorly labeled. There is trash everywhere. Food and drinks are very overpriced.

An artsy building that is true to its name,Taylor B,"The 10-story Fine Arts Building, also known as the Studebaker Building, houses artists' lofts, art galleries, theatre, dance and recording studios, interior and web design firms, musical instrument makers and other businesses associated with the arts. It also is home to the Studebaker Theatre and the Artists Cafe and offices of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Jazz Institute of Chicago, the Grant Park Conservancy, the World Federalist Associations and the Chicago Youth Symphony. Located at 410 South Michigan Avenue, across the street from Grant Park in the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District, the Fine Arts Building was constructed in 1894-1895 and extensively remodeled in 1898 when the top three floors were added. The two granite columns at the main entrance, each three feet eight inches in diameter and 12 feet 10 inches tall were said to be the largest polished monolithic shafts in the country. The interior features Art Nouveau motifs and murals by artists such as Martha Susan Baker, Frederic Clay Bartlett, Olivet Dennett Grover, Frank Xavier Leyendecker and Bertha Sophia Menzler-Peyton and date from the 1898 renovation. In 1931, Paul Whiteman and his orchestra gave the first public performance of Grand Canyon Suite at the Studebaker Theatre. Since 2016, it has served as a live theater with a 740 seating capacity. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a Chicago Landmark in 1978.",Fine Arts Building,March 2019,50

It is standing room only on the main floor and then the balcony has chairs on the railing that are first come, first served and fill up fast. You need to stand in line and wait if you hope to get one. If you don't get a seat at the railing, it will be hard to see the band. Beer/drinks are affordably priced-what a nice and unexpected treat!

The staff on the other hand is extremely rude. When we arrived we were asked to give our IDs, the man proceed to take our IDs and walked away, with no explanation. When we followed him inside of the bar we watched as he went in and out of several different rooms without explaining to us what he was doing with our IDs. He then came up to us and stated that he would not be giving them back because “they were fakes”. supposedly they have several fakes from the state that we are from. We then requested to see the manager where we promptly showed several other forms of identification and successfully proved that our IDs were in fact authentic. He did not apologize or acknowledge how poorly that situation was handled. Instead he walked over got us 21 and over wristbands and walked away.",Lincoln Hall,November 2019,10

I am so glad we decided to go, and we will return for sure! There is a suggested donation of $5 per adult at the entrance to the indoor gardens, it is VERY well worth it. 1-2 hours really should be sufficient for a trip, but we could have easily spent more time there with the huge variety of exhibits!",Garfield Park Conservatory,August 2019,50

An important example of Prairie School landscape architecture,Taylor B,"The Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool, also known as the Lincoln Park Lily Pool, was developed in 1936-1938. Located at 125 West Fullerton Parkway, between Stockton and Cannon Drives in Lincoln Park, north of the Lincoln Park Zoo and next to the Lincoln Park Conservatory, it is an important example of Prairie School landscape architecture and represents one of Caldwell's most fully realized designs with the Sun Opening or clearing, curving walkways and meandering, stepping-stone limestone paths and circular benches. Frank Lloyd Wright's influence is represented in the organic architecture of the shelter and the Fullerton Parkway Gate, a prairie-style entryway into the property. In the 1950s, under Lincoln Park Zoo director Marlin Perkins, the pool was transformed into a water exhibit featuring exotic birds and water fowl. From 1998 to 2002, the 2.7-acre Lily Pool underwent a major restoration by the Chicago Park District and the Lincoln Park Conservancy. It was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002 and added to the National Register of Historic Places and listed as a National Historic Landmark in 2006.",Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool,August 2019,50

The place to see independent and foreign films,Taylor B,"For the last two decades, Music Box Theatre at 3722 North Southport has been the premier venue in Chicago for independent and foreign films. It currently has the largest theatre space operated full-time in the city. The Music Box opened in 1929, a time when the movie palaces in downtown Chicago each had seating capacities of 3,000 people. At the time, the Music Box accommodated only 800 and was considered an elaborate little brother to the giants. Theatre Architecture magazine observed that the Music Box ""represents the smaller, though charming and well equipped, sound picture theatre which is rapidly taking the place of the deluxe palace."" The architecture reminds me of the old Capital Theatre on the South Side. The actual style is called atmospheric, a dark blue, cove-lit ceiling with twinkling stars and moving cloud formations that suggest a night sky. The plaster ornamentation of the sidewalls, round towers, faux-marble loggia and ogee arched organ chambers are, by Hollywood standards, reminiscent of the walls surrounding an Italian courtyard. The overall effect is to make the patron feel that they are watching a film in an open-air palazzo. In 1991, the late Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel called the Music Box his favorite movie theatre and ""a significant Chicago cultural attraction, a showcase for progressive filmmaking at a time when American movie theaters are as homogenized as the films they exhibit."" The Music Box holds many annual events, including some decades-old traditions. Since 1983, for example, the theatre has shown White Christmas and It's a Wonderful Life for the week leading up to Christmas. Two newer traditions are the showing of The Poseidon Adventure on New Year's Eve and a 24-hour horror movie film festival in October known as ""The Music Box Horrors."" I remember going to the movies with my father every Wednesday afternoon before I was a teenager...to the Beverly or Highland or Capital or Jeffery or Highway. Always a different movie at each theater. And a good hamburger joint nearby. Those were the good old days. The Music Box fuels those wonderful memories.",Music Box Theatre,January 2015,50

They make juices out of pretty much whatever fruits and vegetables they have available.  I highly recommend the juice experience.  The shops are interesting and jam packed with all things Indian.

Highly recommended is the carillon tour, but be prepared - it's 271 steep, winding steps up the bell tower.

Then after a climb through the inside of the tower (and over part of the roof!) we enjoyed magnificent views over UChicago and Hyde Park. The chapel asks for a $5 donation. The carillon player showed us how she played the bells and the kids got to hit a few notes. A great experience. UChicago is quite a ways south from downtown but if you are in the area for the Robie House, to tour the University, etc., this is a great thing to do! ",Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,July 2015,50

I didn't know it was a museum,nickd18,"I walked past the Bridgehouse and Museum at least 4 times.  I did notice that the door seemed open but I did not clue of what it was.  The view of the river from there is excellent and the view of the incredible buildings around there  (Wrigley Building, Trump Tower, Chicago Tribune, etc.) is very worthwhile.

Superb graduation venue,Chas1261,"The Rockefeller Chapel on the University of Chicago campus is beautiful. We have visited twice, both for medical school graduations.

A soaring religious experience,AlWalavich,"Don't be fooled by the name--this a chapel that looks more like a grand and glorious cathedral.  Built only in the 1920's, this is grand Gothic at its finest and it is a ""wow"" space for almost everybody   This is a non-denominational space with subtle beauty wherever one looks, and, if you happen to hit the carillon playing--an unmatched experience.

Beautiful Chapel,Kaataan,"This is a great chapel to see if you are visiting Chicago. Of course, it is a bit away from the main city and quite a trek down to the Southside. However, if you are visiting the University of Chicago, this is a must-see. The acoustics inside the Chapel is very nice. During the Jazz festival, they do have some concerts in them. They are wonderful to attend, especially at night. However, do be careful as just one block further south can be very dangerous and extremely unsafe. You should stick to crowds and walk through the campus to get further north as there are security guards posted in many places.",Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,March 2014,50

Small museum adds punch to your Water Tower visit,arriveanddepart,"Situated right alongside the western border of Water Tower Park lies Loyola University's downtown location and the three-story LUMA museum. While in existence for about seven years, I wasn't aware of this small but surprising museum until I had heard about its special Sacred Geometry exhibit. Upon my arrival, I climbed the stairway to the reception area and was warmly greeted by Loyola student employees who worked the gift shop and museum security. The Sacred Geometry exhibit offered room after room of vague connections between the sacred and secular afrt pieces...and geometry for that matter (curator should definitely have provided text at each point with more details and explanations for artistic choices made than leaving it to the observer to surmise). However, the adjacent photo exhibit and the third-floor permanent collection was worth the $8 admission. Permanent collection of sacred art and objects spans medieval, renaissance and baroque periods. Looking forward to the international creche exhibit in November and December, which LUMA evidently stages each year. Nice gift and book shop, with free coat check. A visit to the LUMA Museum gives the Water Tower visitor yet another venue to enjoy if spending an afternoon on Michigan Avenue. Tuesday is free day -- and open until 8 p.m.",Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA),October 2012,40

Inside this structure which raises the Michicagn Ave., bridge, there is a museum about the Chistmas Schooners that delivered trees to Chicagoans around about 1900 from Manistique, MI down the lake and has more early history of Chicago. Also shows the working of the bridge. Did you know that the bridge is counterbalanced so that there is almost no weight to raise it? I never knew that and have lived here a long time. Fascinating.

A muti-functional church where you can catch some really great concerts besides the more spiritual aspect.  From there it is an esay jump to the Robbie house across the street and the University of Chicago with its similar in style campus (at least the old section).  There are also other churches in th area that are worth a look - perhaps not as impressive but beautiful in their own right. The neighborhood has some really great residential architecture that is a perfect setting for the Chapel, the other churches and the campus.

They have tons of artifacts stored at other warehouses. Personally, I think a bigger venue is called for. It's amazing how they amassed so much literature and mementos.

Another area had miscellaneous military objects donated to the museum, from medals and patches to canteens since WWII to bayonets, to field surgery instruments and more. And there's a Medal of Honor exhibit. The staff we chatted with were very knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about sharing their knowledge. At a $5 entrance fee, its a pretty good bargain for a museum.

A beautiful contrast to modern Chicago landscape,Jules454,"This was a truly spectacular building, a tribute to philanthropy. The interior was sumptuous, with elaborate carving and altar. Very reverential atmosphere.",Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,September 2015,40
Some of my best memories,Elepaio_Travels,"I'm biased because I graduated from UC in this very chapel. I have many memories here, from just sitting and staring up into the ceiling, listening to ethereal organ concerts, to smiling at a student prank that reprogrammed the hourly carillon bells to the tune, ""Three Blind Mice."" Plus, the religious events were always welcoming of other faiths and non-believers. Always a good feeling to go through the doors. Rockefeller is ""old school"" university memories -- as opposed to the ""new school"" bastion of corporate capitalism that sits just across the street (business school).",Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,July 2015,50
Lovely Chapel,Sherryinpgh,Beautiful chapel…although they don't call it a church anymore…whatever!  It's a beautiful church.  We were able to listen to an organ rehearsal as we walked around and up into the balcony.  Stop by when visiting the Oriental Institute which is just around the corner.,Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,October 2015,50
Wow - what an experience,LAtoEverywhere,"We visited the Rockefeller Chapel, to attend the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon Tower Tour.    We were trying to see the Robie House, but it was closed, and the Chapel is right across the street.  We went in to take a look, and there was a tour just starting, that took you up to the tower, and you actually get to see the gentleman play the bells.  This was a wonderful experience,  $5 donations are encouraged but you will most likely want to give more.  What an artist...........  And the view was priceless.  You have to pay a fortune at other points in the city - so this was a double great.  We go to see the bells on the walk up.  Please make this a must see.",Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,October 2015,50

Up she rises,spinkick,"There are i believe 18 bridges in the city which are raised and lowered in succession in order to allow the yearly boat run to the yacht harbor and in the fall back in for winter storage. Also if a tall ship needs through this happens. There is a schedule and times are announced. towards the end of the river tour there is an example of an open bridge looks like. From the top of the bridgehouse there is a nice view of the city. The museum explains the history and function of a bastule bridge and you can see the actual yellow gears used to lift the bridges. Its a fun experience. bit of a chuckle: there was a homeless guy living in one of the bridges for over 3 years he spliced into the power supply and had a heater fan and tv inside his little ""home""",The McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum,June 2017,30
Hidden jewel! A must for history enthusiasts.,BrendaLV,"I found this place while checking out the river walk. It looked unique so I decided to check it out. Unfortunately for me, I had a sprained ankle but decided to tour it anywats. It's a beautiful structure and gives a detailed history of the Bridgehouse and the Chicago River. There's LOTS of stairs but I gave it my all and went to the top floor. I love history so it was the perfect stop for me.",The McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum,June 2017,50

There are contemporary exhibits, such as Andy Warhol's interactive Silver Clouds and illustrations by Edward Gorey. Free tours are available to anyone looking to learn more about this very unique collection.

a very special place,artm534,"This is a very special place that is providing a great service to the country and to veterans.  More of a library than a museum or maybe more of a research institute - whatever it is it does a great job both with the presentation (most available by podcast), by the displays in the museum and by the library portion with such a large specialized inventory of books.  In addition I have been advised that the staff provides research assistance on military subjects.  Overall a great place.",Pritzker Military Museum & Library,August 2016,50
Interesting Museum,rndmlttrs,"A small, but interesting collection.  The library clearly would be a good place for researchers, but the space had several interesting temporary exhibitions.

We went to see ""It's A Wonderful Life"" which, of course, we've seen 100 times but only on TV.  How fun to see it on the big screen.  But even more fun is the live organist and Christmas carolers pre-movie and then, a big treat: a Christmas sing-along with organ accompaniment and lyrics projected on the screen.  Clearly we should have thought to wear our ugly Christmas sweaters and bring our jingle bells as many in the audience did.  Fun hissing at Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and oh, how beautiful is Donna Reed up on the big screen. Jimmy Stewart is his quintessential best. If you can, come early and explore the fun shops on Southport.  Try to take public transportation because parking is pretty bad.",Music Box Theatre,December 2015,50

They have a 70mm projector so one can see the format which is so unusual to find these days.  There is also a bar attached which makes for a more upscale movie experience.

Highlights include lovely, pastel stained glass, wonderful carved wood, and one of the largest carillons in the world.  I'm not sure how often this is open to the public, but if you have a chance, a hike up the bell tower let's you see the enormous bells, and then affords you a 360 degree view of Chicago, the campus and Lake Michigan to the east.

quite small but special,ELKW,"we went there in Open house, so it's free, but it has admission fee in other days, can double check it on their website. It's so small, and every floor just has a few exhibition boards (the small one, may be A4 size), although they said you may have opportunities to see the gear moving, but the chance is minimal as there is seldom a big ship to pass the river that needs to lift up the bridge. Inside the bridge tower, you can view outside through the circular window, but one of the window is very blurred and you are hard to see things outside, the other one is better, when you go further up, you can have a look to the street view from a top angle. All the floors are only connected with stairs, so it's not possible to use stroller or wheelchairs.

Museum/library for the study of military history,Taylor B,"The Pritzker Military Museum and Library is more of a research library than a museum. Founded in 2003, its collection comprises over 70,000 items and includes more than 45,000 books, as well as periodicals, videos, artwork, posters, rare military ephemera, over 9,000 photographs from the Civil War and the Spanish-American War to the present, letters and journals from American soldiers and a large collection related to Winston Churchill. Also on display are a Revolutionary War soldier's pocket journal, a Medal of Honor and classic World War I posters. In addition, Sam Gevirtz, who was a private first class gunner on an aircraft carrier during the Okinawa invasion of World War II, donated his two diaries to the library. Originally located at 610 North Fairbanks Court in the Streeterville neighborhood, the library was moved to its current address at 104 South Michigan Avenue in the Loop. In 2009, the library was named one of 10 recipients of the National Medal for Museum and Library Service, the nation's highest honor for museums and libraries. Among the most interesting possessions of the library is a non-circulating collection of more than 3,000 rare books and periodicals, including Famiano Strada's De Bello Belgico, published in London in 1650, and John Entick's The General History of the Late War: Containing its Rise, Progress, and Event, to Europe, Asia, Africa and America, published in London in 1763.

Vintage Theater Boasts Great Programming; Needs a Bit of TLC,retro1959,"This vintage theater has one of the best programs of new-release art, independent and classic films in the city, and hosts retrospectives, interpretive talks, and more. As the brochure states, it's like a ongoing film festival, all taking place in a charming old auditorium. The small second screen is like a cozy home theater. Lobby, concessions and restrooms are all fine; you can buy adult beverages too. The theater is ""unmolested,"" meaning it hasn't been overhauled or remodeled in any way that would detract from its original charm. However, it does suffer some ""benign neglect""--for instance, the carpeting is long overdue for replacement and your nose tells you this every time you visit. Wall sconces are dusty/cobwebbed, some seats are lumpy, etc. Nothing really bad. We're lucky to have this old one in overall good shape, and showing fabulous content.",Music Box Theatre,June 2016,40

A Hidden Neighborhood Gem,Amy Y,"As a Chicago local who has lived here for about 6 years, I enjoy exploring nearby neighborhoods to find hidden gems. While on a Saturday morning walk with my partner, we came across the Holy Trinity Orthodox Cathedral, a beautiful building that had caught our eye before. This time, the doors to the cathedral were open, so we poked our heads in. We were greeted by two friendly volunteers who offered to tour us around the facility and share its unique history. We had some time to spare, so we took them up on their offer and were not disappointed. Our private tour lasted about an hour, but probably could've taken less time had we not asked so many questions. We enjoyed learning about the cathedrals involvement with such influential names as Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, and the fascinating journey and history of a prized religiously significant artifact. The tour concluded with us ringing the (original) church bells, which was on my partner's bucket list! What a lovely stop on our Saturday morning walk, and a visit worth sharing. We hope to encourage others to visit this gem. Enjoy!",Holy Trinity Orthodox Cathedral,June 2019,50

As ""Illinoisnow"" comments, you do not have to be a religious person to appreciate this building.  But if you ARE a religious person,  you will have to look very, very hard to find a cross or any other explicitly religious symbol.

It's a bit austere.",Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,October 2016,30

Graduates look forward to walking down the aisle and getting their diploma.  One of the things I love about U of C is a faculty member gives the graduation address.  No celebrities.  No fancy people.  Just a faculty member.  U of C students come to learn and faculty members have to teach. It sums up the U of C experience perfectly",Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,September 2016,50
Worth a view if you are strolling the river walk.,cmleturno,"This fountain was created to celebrate the centennial of the reversal of the Chicago River. In the summer every hour it shoots a a large arc of water across the Chicago River. Overall it's not too impressive to look at, but a nice addition to the River Walk and has an interesting story nonetheless. The reversal of the river (so that it flows away from Lake Michigan) instead of into it) is a crazy feat of engineering. ",Centennial Fountain and Water Arc,April 2015,40
Big Squirt,Rolf A,"You don't need to take a boat ride, but it's more fun, to see the great water jet that commemorates the wet founding of Chicago.

Gem of a museum,Claudette C,My sister and I discovered this museum as we were walking along the river. The building is small but tells a great story about the bridges and waterways in Chicago.

Small but worth a visit,grigolm,"Museum is right on the river walk. This is very small but good place to see the mechanics of bridges and learn about history of Chicago river, how they turned the direction of the river, what role does river play in City's life and how bridges on that river operate.

Looking for a museum a bit out of the ordinary?,Phil N,"This museum inside the Southwest tower of the Michigan Avenue bridge over the Chicago River (at Wacker Drive) is lots of fun.   At the lowest level you can see the gears used as the bridge is opened.   On the other levels the museum does a wonderful job of giving the history of the river, including the major turn-of-the-century reversal of the direction of the river away from Lake Michigan to stop sewage going into the lake and Chicago's drinking water.

A True Gem!,maryq333,"First of all, I want to note that the museum is FREE through November 2017. The top floor has a wonderful collection of religious art and artifacts. It doesn't matter if you follow any particular faith, it's fascinating just to study the craftsmanship of the works. The second floor has rotating exhibits. I HIGHLY recommend the current exhibit by photographer Jeffrey Wolin called ""Pigeon Hill: Then and Now."" It is extremely moving, and is a stunning look at poverty, defeat, and occasionally triumph in America's heartland. Wolin took portraits in this housing project outside of Bloomington in the early 1990's, then returned 20 years later to re-shoot his subjects and find out what happened in their lives during that time. Gorgeous photography and compelling stories. Spend some time at this exhibit, and it becomes obvious that, as Sen. Al Franken recently said, to pull yourself up by the bootstraps, first you need to have boots. Some people don't. Haunting. ",Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA),July 2017,50

"""Best Music Around""",jacksB173YR,"Have been going to this festival for years - the music is the best of any of the festivals going out there - so if you can go and go for all 3/4 days - that's the BEST PRICE around......If you can do a VIP ticket - boy it is worth it.....the biggest deal here - is: BE PREPARED TO WALK and a ton....its over a mile from the BUDWEISER stage to the bottow of GRANT PARK's last stage - with 5 other stages in the mix along the way.....there used to be golf carts on the outside of the event to get from one end to the other, but unless a VIP - that is gone.....hotels generally overcharge for this event - so get your hotel early - most places on MICHIGAN Avenue are gone early.....ENJOY the MUSIC",Lollapalooza,August 2016,50
Great festival in the heart of the city!,Marissa M,"If you have never been to a music festival before Lollapalooza is the perfect one to start with. You can stay in a hotel and walk to everything you need. You will need to plan early if you want to attend. Tickets go on sale 6 months before the festival and they go very quickly. I'd suggest having a couple people try to get through. If you are flying in you can arrive at Midway or Ohare airports. Midway is a little closer to the city center but both airports have a train that can take you directly into the city center. Lollapalooza attracts fans of all ages. There will be lots of teenagers at the House Music stage (Perry's) so I'd steer clear of that if you are tying to have a more relaxing experience. For those that want to take in all the festival has to offer stopping by for a set there is a must. When you're packing make sure you have: disposable ponchos, comfortable shoes that you can wear all day, sunscreen and plastic zip lock bags for your phone in case it rains. Also, make sure you have a big breakfast every morning.. The days are long but TONS OF FUN!",Lollapalooza,August 2017,50
"Great, but feeling old",Scott G,"So bottom line...Lollapalooza is still cool, though trending to the under 30 crowd.  The over 40s can still go, but probably will be most happy just sticking to the later shows with the headliners.",Lollapalooza,August 2017,40

Concert great ...venue horrible!!,shelia965,"Went to see Donnie Brothers and Chicago last night. Thought we had great seats until we got there! The seats are folding chairs made for a hundred pound person. They are cable tied together. Now imagine a full row of overweight 50-60 years olds siting together and it's 95 degrees outside and humid!!!  We live in a suburb and always take the train into the city, then use public transportation. The cab dropped us off on the turnaround in front of the Planetarium and venue. We left the concert early, due to the fact that my husband had a knee replacement 4 weeks prior , and felt it would be easier not fighting the crowd at the end. Little did we know that the street is closed afterwards and does not allow any public transportation in to pick up! The only thing there were the bike rickshaws to take you where you needed to go. We asked one to get us to Union Station......$60....... uh no thanks! So we walked a mile to get a cab ! We don't mind walking, actually love it, but not 4 weeks after knee surgery! On top of it, didn't even get a cocktail!! $15-20! Wake up people ...this is Chicago....we are hardworking Midwesteners who like our beer and burgers, but not at that price!!

"An Inspiring Story, but Amateurishly Told",886kenf,"Having visited Chicago many times, my wife suggested that I visit the Hull-House Museum as a historic site I had not yet seen. I knew a little about Jane Addams' story from American History class in high school but little else. Relatively little of the original settlement complex remains due to the encroach of the University of Illinois - Chicago in the 1960's and the current museum is on the University's campus. It is a small museum and can easily be appreciated in one or two hours. There wasn't a clear order to the exhibits, so I went on a tour. This tour was led by three different people with three very different styles of presentation. The first person gave a straightforward talk about Addams' background and the conditions in the neighborhood of Hull House in the 19th century. The second person showed us her bedroom upstairs and emphasized her possible connection to the LGBTQ community. The third person showed us a small gallery dedicated to a study of over-incarceration of immigrants, minorities, the mentally ill and poor people in the US. This study was very moving and was a powerful reminder that Jane Addams' advocacy for the forgotten and underprivileged is needed now more than ever. Unfortunately, the third docent presented this as more of a political indoctrination session than an honest discussion. I assume that the museum relies on volunteers to run the tours, but some better organization and objectivity would be affordable and welcome. Nevertheless, Jane Addams' story has great resonance for our current times and hearing this story was personally uplifting to me.",Jane Addams' Hull-House Museum,June 2017,40
Glad We Went,ace4444,"We enjoyed our visit to Hull House. I knew only a little of the story, and liked the facility and history a good deal. The recommended donation for entry is $5.

An exceptional American,Simon C,"Incredibly my Lonely Planet guide has not a single mention of Jane Addams or this museum.  I only discovered it through an internet search after seeing murals about her at the Hyde Park Metra station. In keeping with the ideals of the founders, there's no hard-sell or hype but it's a fascinating and well planned small museum, worth at least an hour of anyone's time.  Text is well balanced with artefacts and original documents without too much perspex. A scale model gives some idea of the scope of the project of which the house is almost the only remnant.  Maybe Addams was too pacifist and bourgeois for modern activists and too much of a radical internationalist to be celebrated by 'true patriots'.  As a courageous pioneer in so many causes, she deserves global recognition.",Jane Addams' Hull-House Museum,November 2017,50

Our tour was given to a small group (6 people) and led by Grace.

"I wish it was more hourly, more often",Allen21096,"The Centennial Fountain and Water Arc is located on the riverfront at McClurg Court and the Chicago River.  It is just west of the last bridge before you get to the Chicago Locks.  The fountain was built in 1989 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Chicago Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.  It was designed by Dirk Lohan and is actually named for Nicholas J. Melas, who was first elected to the CWRC in 1962 and served 30 years - the last 18 years as president of the board of commissioners.  Every hour during the summer months, the water cannon shoots a massive water arc from the north side of the riverfront to the south side that lasts 10 minutes.  If you happen to be on the river in a boat, you'll need to get there on the hour to witness it and get a little wet.  Or you can sit at one of the nearby river walk cafes or restaurants and watch everyone else get wet.  But why put up the monument, you ask?  The fountain commemorates a major achievement in the reversing  of the flow of the Chicago River in 1900, which was ultimately named a ""Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium"" by the American Society of Civil Engineers",Centennial Fountain and Water Arc,August 2017,50

Things to know before you go to Northerly Island,Donna H,"The pros:  Beautiful venue right on Lake Michigan.  Not a bad seat in the house and if you don't like sitting, you can stand along the sides and back and no one bothers you.  the sound is good and they have large video screens so you don't miss anything no matter where you sit.  The restrooms on the south side of the venue are much less busy than the ones where you first walk in, and no waiting at all while the concert is going.  Cons:  At intermission, there are just not enough concessions, but if you are only looking for a beer or water, the small vendors did not have lines.  Parking is a nightmare and confusing.  When you buy your ticket, get the premium parking.  Worth every penny and it gets you very close to the venue.  Without the VIP parking, you have to go to the north museum parking lot, and it is not marked well.  We ended up going all the way around the drive past the premium parking and back to the garage.  Once in the garage, it was a l5 minute walk to the venue and we ended up missing half of the first band.  They have trolleys going both ways but on the way back, the traffic is so bad, you might as well walk.  Get to the event early so you don't have to deal with the traffic and parking.  Eat before you go.  Prices are ridiculously inflated.",Northerly Island,June 2016,40
Not a Pleasant Experience,Wog210,"Went to Northerly Island this past Saturday to a see Steve Winwood and Steely Dan. The music was great, everything else not so much. The venue is pedestrian at best. No real rows, just folding chairs held together by zip ties. The seats are not anchored so no two rows are shaped the same, giving some people a lot of leg room, others none. All the seats are too smal with no elbow room. The asphalt is flat, so views of the stage are difficult. Stared most of the evening at least he back of some big guy's Canucks hat a few rows up. Drinks and food are pricey, and the facilities port-a-potties for the most part. The worst part was trying to get out. There is not a cab to be found for miles. Had to walk all the way to South Michigan Avenue, to a hotel, to flag a cab. (Tried Uber but they were price gouging at that point). They really need to set aside an area for cabs somewhere within reasonable walking distance. To sum up, music great, venue just short of a debacle.",Northerly Island,June 2016,20
Great venue especially on a nice summer evening,Sandyk216B,"Great views of Chicago, plenty of restrooms, good seats.

The bathrooms were stinky dirty, with no soap, toilet paper, or paper towels. I was definitely roughing it!  Not my type of venue, but others might like the atmosphere.

Specialty museum with a cool story,AlexB10499,"Another one of Chicago’s cool specialty museums that tells the story of a particular aspect of the city’s rich history. This one is kind of two stories that can’t be told apart: how the Chicago River has evolved over the centuries, and how the city’s system of bridges have emerged to connect people on all banks of the river. True to its name, the museum is located inside the McCormick Bridgehouse, which is right next to the DuSable Bridge (the bridge that carries Michigan Avenue over the river). The entrance is accessible from the Riverwalk. I visited on a rainy day, which may have had something to do with this, but it honestly smelled something like a fish tank when I was inside the bridgehouse. I think its proximity to the river means that the smell will always be there to some degree. Even so, it didn’t really impact my visit. I found the exhibits and panels to be very thorough in their storytelling, and I came away knowing FAR more about the river’s amazing history than I went in knowing. Be aware that visiting this museum means you’ll be climbing multiple flights of stairs; the bridgehouse is a thin, five-story structure. It may not be the best place for people with reduced mobility, but there are a few seats available on every floor. For its inexpensive ticket price and coherent narrative, I think this museum is well worth a visit if you like history or engineering.",The McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum,September 2019,40

More than Imagined,Beatriz121,"For all the times I have been in the area of LUMA, I never realized the place existed.  I'm happy I finally discovered the art museum and plan to go back again, especially to see the stained glass windows which I somehow missed. When I stopped, displays included an eclectic mix of art focusing on such things as race, LGBTQ issues, photos from the Yollocalli project, life in Africa, and depictions of various saints.  Just when I thought I had seen it all, a staff member pointed out that there were more items on the 3rd floor.  Don't miss it!  There are paintings, carvings, works in metal, etc. from South America, Europe, etc. that go back hundreds of years. There is no charge to visit the museum, but donations are appreciated.

Don't Do It,tinap55,If I could give this venue a zero I would! Went and saw Farmaid which we have been to others and this venue was the worst! We had seats which were folding chairs zip tied together. Really?!! Sound was awful ! And the lay of the land is flat so if you are short with someone tall in front of you..... You won't see anything. The lawn seats.... Well I will let someone else explain those! Thank god we didn't pay to sit there! The food..... Awful.... Plain awful!!!!!!!!  And the prices!!!! Well pretty much we expected!  The in and out of this venue is not secure either. Very disappointed with the whole venue and concert! Jack Johnson was the best!

There are bands for everyone, but realize you probably won't get to all that you plan to see - crossing the park is farther than you realize and if you stop along the way for food or to check out a random band you hadn't planned on or to stop at the Lolla shop or to take pics or to play bocce, or to have a wine pop... it just takes longer than you think.

Spend time in the Rare Book Reading Room,Taylor B,"It has been said, by some reviewers, that the Pritzker Military Museum & Library in Chicago is more library than museum. And that might be true. But there is such a treasure trove of rare and interesting books, including a sizable collection relating to Winston Churchill, that it is worth a trip to spend time in the Rare Book Reading Room to catch up on history that dates to the 1600s and 1700s and 1800s that you can't find anywhere else. Located at 104 South Michigan Avenue, on the second floor, it was founded in 2003 for the study of ""the citizen soldier as an essential element for the preservation of democracy."" The collection features over 115,000 items, including more than 67,000 books, as well as periodicals, videos, artwork, posters and rare military ephemera, over 9,000 photographs and glass negatives from the American Civil War and the Spanish-American War to the present, letters and journals from American soldiers, newspaper cartoons by Pulitzer Prize winning newspaper artist Bill Mauldin, war-related sheet music and many materials relating to Churchill. Another fascinating exhibit are two World War II diaries donated to the museum by Chicagoan Sam Gevirtz, who served on the aircraft carrier USS Bunker Hill during the invasion of Okinawa in 1945. If you are a historian, especially related to the Civil War and World War I and II, if you are interested in such subjects as Civil War regimental histories or military aviation or World War II unit histories, even Soviet history, the Pritzker beckons.",Pritzker Military Museum & Library,November 2019,50

I had a wonderful time at the Chicago DMB shows over the 4th of July but with that being said of the 10 venues I've seen them play this was by far the worst set up.  If I'm on the lawn I want to be able to view the stage…you can't, I prefer when there's a roof because the band can use more of their lights and that doesn't happen with this temporary stage, the lines to get in were annoying but not the end of the world…they built a permanent set up on what amounts to a runway.  I would have thought it was very cool for a single show but who builds a full time venue on a piece of land that doesn't slope?

Great venue; ridiculous prices,doril911,"I live in Chicago and attended my first concert here last night. The venue and concert were great (Beck). It also helped that the weather was perfect.

It is a bit of a pain to get to and from. We took the red line to Roosevelt and walked over. Nice walk but at least 20 minutes. My friend insisted on taking a pedicab back to the Roosevelt L stop which I refused to chip in on. I'd rather walk. But she said her treat. Whatever. It was $25 per person just to get back to the red line. $50 and he rode like a maniac running red lights weaving through traffic.  Great venue, but I'm too old and cranky to pay these prices.

A dynamic memorial to social reformer Jane Addams,Taylor B,"The Jane Addams Hull-House Museum serves as a dynamic memorial to social reformer Jane Addams, the first American woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, and her colleagues whose work changed the lives of their immigrant neighbors as well as national and international pubic policy. The museum, located at 800 South Halsted Street on Chicago's near South Side, near the University of Illinois-Chicago campus, preserves and develops the original Hull-House site for the interpretation and continuation of the historic settlement house vision, linking research, education and social engagement. It is located in two of the original settlement house buildings--the Hull Home, now a National Historic Landmark, and the Residents' Dining Hall, a beautiful arts and crafts building that has welcomed some of the world's most important thinkers, artists and activists. Jane Addams, who was born in Cedarville, Illinois, in 1860, co-founded Hull-House with Ellen Gates Starr in 1889 as a social settlement on Chicago's West Side. From Hull-House, where she lived and worked until her death in 1935, Jane Addams built her reputation as the country's most prominent woman through her writing, settlement work and international efforts for peace. Hull-House played a vital role in redefining American democracy in the modern age. By 1900, the United States had over 100 settlement houses. By 1911, Chicago had 35. Hull-House was a place where immigrants of diverse communities gathered to learn to eat, to debate and to acquire the tools necessary to put down roots in their new country. Today, the museum's collection is made up of more than 5,500 artifacts relating to the vibrant work of the Hull-House settlement and the surrounding neighborhood. It speaks to a cross-section of life on the near West Side of Chicago at the turn of the 20th century with objects that relate to the lives of middle-class residents of the Hull-House settlement and the immigrant and working-class neighbors who lived in nearby tenements. Highlights from the museum include: oral histories from Hull-House residents and neighbors, artifacts from Maxwell Street market, period and folkloric clothing from neighbors on the near West Side, portraits and drawings of neighbors and settlement life by Hull-House residents, furnishings from Jane Addams' collection and pottery produced by artists at the Hull-House kilns. A visit to the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum is a fascinating and educational journey into the history of Chicago at the turn of the 20th century.",Jane Addams' Hull-House Museum,November 2018,50
"Hull House, an American treasure",Sydele G,"There are only two buildings left from the original complex that served hundreds of thousands of Chicago immigrants from the 1880’s for 75 years.

The museum docents are interesting, and they bring the exhibits alive.",Jane Addams' Hull-House Museum,November 2018,50

A dynamic memorial to the first American woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize,Taylor B,"Chicagoans know more about Al Capone than Jane Addams. That scenario should change. Every elementary school student should be required to take a field trip to the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum and learn about the social reformer who became the first American woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, whose work changed the lives of immigrant neighbors and national and international public policy. She is every bit as important and as significant to the development of the United States as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  The museum, located at 800 South Halsted Street on Chicago's near South Side, near the University of Illinois-Chicago campus, is housed in two of the original settlement house buildings--the Hull House, a National Historic Landmark, and the Residents' Dining Hall, a beautiful Arts and Crafts building that has welcomed some of the world's most important thinkers, artists and activists. Founded in 1889 as a social settlement, Hull-House played a vital role in redefining American democracy in the modern age. Addams helped to pass critical legislation and influenced public policy on public health and education, free speech, philanthropy, racism, women's movements, civic affairs, fair labor practices, immigrants' rights, recreation and desegregation. The museum's collection features more than 5,500 artifacts relating to the vibrant work of the Hull-House Settlement and the surrounding neighborhood, including life on Chicago's Near West Side at the turn of the 20th century. Highlights of the collection include intricate textiles woven in the Hull-House Labor Museum, portraits and drawings of neighbors and settlement life by Hull-House residents, pottery produced by artists at the Hull-House kilns, period and folkloric clothing from neighbors on the Near West Side, artifacts from the nearby Maxwell Street market, furnishings from Jane Addams' collection and oral histories from Hull-House residents and neighbors.

Worst concert I have ever attended,Toni Ann F,"3 others and myself attended the Dave Matthews concert on July5th. I have not had as terrible a time anywhere. Getting in line to enter the venue was a mess. No lines corded off--everyone was in a big group. People pushing and shoving to get ahead of whoever was in front of them. Then once we were inside we went to the beer tents that were at the beginning of the site. We had to wait in line for 90 minutes for a beer. There was no consistency with the people serving the beer. The servers had to walk 20 feet back to the beer taps then walk back 20 feet to the counter to give the customers their beer. What a miserable mess it was. We missed the first half of the concert waiting in line for drinks. Also, people that were coming in to the park just cut right in front of people waiting for so long. There was no organization to the lines that should of been clearly marked. I will NEVER go back to Northerly Island again. And I will tell everyone I know to not go their either.

Beautiful building!,JoannaS681,"I fell madly in love with this cinema as soon as I saw the outside ticket booth and sign. Once in the theatre, the gorgeous interior was incredible - including the snack counters, posters and vintage signs/screens. We visited in October so there was Halloween decorations around too which added to the vintage feel, I’m unsure what the decor is like usually. The main screen was huge and kind of eerie which I liked (again, this fell in line with the Halloween decorations and the film we were watching). Ok the seats are not massive comfy lazyboys or anything but it keeps in theme with the old theatre and looks beautiful. We were only staying in Chicago for a few days so only visited once, however we saw some leaflets for movie events coming up that looked great. If I lived in the area I’d like to think I’d attend some of their ‘film buff’ events as they sounded great and so interesting! Especially over Halloween. We didn’t visit the bar but popped our heads in - it looked quite busy with a nice atmosphere. Wish I was in Chicago for longer to visit this theatre again, really really loved it.

Located at 1121 North Leavitt Street, in the Ukrainian Village neighborhood, it was built in 1903, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and designated a Chicago Landmark in 1979. Curiously, construction was partly financed by a donation of 4,000 roubles (or $2,700) from Tsar St. Nicholas II of Russia and $1,250 from Sullivan, who also donated the priceless Healy & Millet manufactured chandelier that is one of the highlights of the interior. The church, which was elevated to a cathedral in 1923, retains many features of Russian provincial architecture, including an octagonal dome, frontal bell tower, cupolas, window and roof framing and Art Nouveau decorative design over the western entrance to the church.",Holy Trinity Orthodox Cathedral,November 2019,50
Don't let the other reviews scare you!,HERXLNC,"I read through many reviews about the venue at Northerly Island. And have to admit that I thought we were in for a night of hell.... turned out to be amazing! Considering it's an outdoor venue, you need to be prepared for the elements and be prepared for port-a-potties type facilities. Drinks were readily available, bathrooms were clean (in these trailer like compartments, like an upgraded port-a-potty). Sound was great. The view was a bonus! What a way to watch the concert....the Chicago skyline right behind the stage. NOTE: sit in section 312 or there about to get the view.",Northerly Island,August 2013,50

Mosh Pit at the Box Office,sea0808,"We had only one option when we bought the tickets ""Will Call"". We arrive and find a mosh pit of people waiting to get their tickets at the box office, at least 200 people waiting at the box office no line and no organization. It took 45min to get to the window and get the tickets, we missed all the opening act. I asked the manager if what she see's outside her window is normal, all she had to say was that they sold a bunch of will call tickets and didn't know it will be that crowded, REALLY !!!!!. All they had to do is get someone outside to organize a line and help direct people",Northerly Island,May 2014,10
"Perfect weather, perfect music!",Gayle L,"We have gone to Northerly Island several times to concerts.

"By any standard, an awe-inspiring monument",Taylor B,"Any time you visit Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on the campus of the University of Chicago, you are awed by its grandeur and size and architectural beauty. That's how I felt the last time I was there, for the memorial service of an old friend, Larry Hawkins, one of the nation's most outstanding high school basketball coaches, chairman of the university's student outreach program and a great humanitarian. It was a fitting place to recall Hawkins' many contributions to the city's black youth. Built between 1925 and 1928 and located on the Midway, Rockefeller Chapel is the most imposing Gothic Revival structure on the campus, meant by patron John D. Rockefeller to be the ""central and dominant feature"" of the campus. At 200.7 feet, it is the tallest building on campus. Designed by architect Bertram Goodhue, it was built without the use of structural steel. It contains about 70 integrated figural sculptures by sculptors Lee Lawrie and Ulric Ellerhusen and interior work by mosaicist Hildreth Meiere. The wood carvings that adorn the organ and South balcony were created y Alois Lang, a Master Woodcarver at the American Seating Company and one of the artists responsible for bringing the medieval art of ecclesiastical carving back to life. His pieces in Rockefeller Chapel are carved from White Appalachian Oak. In addition, the chapel contains the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon and tower, a 72-bell carillon and the second largest carillon in the world. Today, the chapel is used for ecumenical worship services, weddings, university convocations, guest speakers, musical programs and occasional film screenings--and Larry Hawkins' memorial service. It occupies nearly all of a block and can seat as many as 1,700 people.",Rockefeller Memorial Chapel,November 2018,50

Management here is so unprofessional.,beautybelle15,"I highly recommend that you never buy tickets for anything at this venue until they have new management. At 11 P.M. last night the headliners were in the middle of performing a song when the venue turned on all the house lights and cut the music. I understand the need to follow a city ordinance but to do so in the way is completely unprofessional. When the act was made aware of the issue and asked to perform a final song for the audience their mics were cut off. That is just horrendous service to everyone involved. Besides that, security was nowhere to be found, let alone able to clear aisles for safety or to keep obnoxious drunk concert goers from standing on their seats with a poster blocking so many people's views. Everything at the facility felt cheap, from the chairs to the food and drink stands- yet my ticket in no way reflected these cost savings. I will not be paying for this kind of experience ever again.

Horrible venue and management,Beba1511,"This place is horrible. They do not take into consideration the feelings of the people who pay money to see a FULL concert at their facility. They have their money and do not care whether a concert finishes or not. They actually stopped the Backstreet Boys mid concert because their time was up because of curfew. They didn't even let them sing one last song after the Backstreet Boys pleaded and begged. People look forward to concerts and expect to get a complete one. One never thinks, oh I hope this finishes on time because they will kick us out. If they are that worried about breaking curfew they should only allow Elmo Sings Along or Barney and Friends Live to play there. Oh and we waited over an hour in line just to get in. The concert was to start at 7:00 and they didn't let people in until 6:30, then we waited again once inside to get to our seats. I will never return to this ridiculous excuse for a concert venue again.",Northerly Island,July 2013,10

One of the best venues ever!,Jackie255VT,"Just attended the Jimmy Buffett concert this past weekend.  This venue is spectacular.  Although the lawn (general admission) makes it a bit difficult to see the stage, if you can floor or bleacher seating, the view is absolutely amazing.  We sat at the top of the bleachers (row V in section 310) and we had the best view of the stage.  This venue has two awesome views as well, one of Lake Michigan (as it site right on the lake) and a spectacular view of the Chicago Skyline. Beautiful.

FirstMerit Bank Pavillion at Northerly Island,lynnet174,"We went to the Jimmy Buffet concert last weekend at the ""newly improved"", expanded concert venue on Northerly Island.  What a mess!  We purchased lawn seats and I will never go back!  The lawn was an absolute mess with mud and water causing your feet to sink in over 4 inches.  The newly planted sod was floating and places to set out your blanket were few.  Parrotheads are a hearty bunch but paying $50 for a ticket to a concert where you do not have ANY view of the stage is a joke.  I am not referring to an obstructed view.  We were about 25 yards back from the very front of the lawn and there was not chance at seeing the stage at all.  I think LiveNation messed up expanding the pavillion.  Mud everywhere, Port-a-johns for paying customers without sani-stations, ridiculously long lines for concessions.  The exits were narrow and jammed at the end.  We were glad not to have participated in the parking mayhem after the concert as we walked to the island.  Never again, I say.  LiveNation has some work to do.  Not good.",Northerly Island,June 2013,10

JImmy Buffett on Northerly Island,Valyn70,"Northerly Island has been newly renovated as a concert venue. They moved the stage so that you now face the Chicago skyline, which is pretty cool. The bathrooms are portable trailers, fairly nice as far as porta johns go. Note that they are all over the place and if you see long lines there is most likely another one close by that is practically empty. They were horribly disorganized as far as food goes (at one point they had pizza- but no cutter). I think the only thing they had on hand were hot dogs (this was just before the concert started). Beer was in short supply as well. Besides the vending the concert itself was great. We were towards the back but not in the dreaded lawn seats (which you cannot see anything, and there is no lawn, just 6-8 inches of mud). Sight lines were good from seats. Grand stand seats looked like they had a great view. Parking is out by Soldier field, quite a hike. We walked in from our hotel. Tailgating was pretty crazy and porta johns out there were long lines. I would probably go again but would try for better seats, if only lawn was available I would pass.",Northerly Island,June 2013,30

The theater does serve drinks and light snacks. It is well cared for and beautiful. The seats are a little tight but when you consider they are nearly 100 years old, well we all have grown some havent we? The most difficult part is getting there or finding parking.

Worst concert venue ever.....,chris_cSomonauk_Il,"Went to see Jimmy Buffett, where do I begin? We were first sent an email through Live Nation that parking would be $20 extra if you showed up @ 2:30 to tailgate, free after 4:30. Show up and parking is $40 dollars, not to mention the horrible traffic control, and we could not have canopies!!! And of course not enough portable bathrooms in the parking lot we were at, lines were long, as expected. They also said that there would be transportation from the parking lots to the concert, and none could be found, and if you ask someone , no one knew. I saw one trolley after we had walked about halfway. The venue itself is terrible. Security is a joke, no one wearing a security shirt even cared what was happening, and none could be found anywhere. If you were able to find a security person and asked them a question, none of them knew anything, just a bunch of kids making an easy paycheck. We had lawn seats, the sod had just been put down maybe a week before the concert. It was a complete mudhole. not to mention you cant see the stage from there. They have two screens to watch the concert from, small in size, but I wasn't  there to watch a concert on a screen, I can do that at home. Sound was horrible, you could barely hear it in the lawn area. So as you may have guessed, we left after about 1 hr of putting up with drunks, mud, and horrible venue. We looked for the ""transportation"" to take us back to our lot, and of course, none be found and no one knew about it. So we walked back 2-3 miles to our lot. A complete unorganized mess, horrible venue, and just all around bad experience. If you planning to see a concert there, I recommend not going, you are guaranteed a bad time.

Finally, you see a miniaturized version of ""The Great Chicago Fire"" and other pictures of what Chicago looked like in the 1800s.

The houses in the neighborhood reminded me of Brooklyn neighborhood, very nice and tree lined. Unfortunately the zoo and lily pond were closed due to private event and wedding shower, so we went to the conservatory instead, which might have been better than spending time in the zoo since it's much cooler and has a lot of exotic plants with fitting and interesting names. We spent a couple of hours there and my daughter played on the piano just outside of it.

Always an enjoyable stop when in the area!,Patricia J,I used to live near the conservatory and always stop in when I visit the zoo or area nearby.  This time I had my kids w/ me - 3 and 7 - and they equally enjoyed it.  ,Lincoln Park Conservatory,August 2019,50

Beautiful ,mariaf730,"Take a tour of the beautiful Chicago theater. Your guide will walk you around the theater including backstage and explain its history and the changes throughout the years. Experience the beauty of this 1920’s theater. Very informative, or better yet attend a performance well worth it.

So many different beers!,JameAndDare,"Very unique and interesting taste in their beers. They have lots of t-shirts for sale, beer mugs and glasses too, as well as coasters and bottle openers.

Allow Yourself to Be Charmed by this Small but Well-Done Museum!,BuenaGirl,"I went to an event at this museum last night, and I absolutely adored it! It was my first visit, because in all the years I've lived in Chicago, I had never heard of it, until seeing a booth at this year's Printers Row Lit Fest. It's in a small space, on the second floor of a downtown office building, so it doesn't shout ""come visit me!"", but it should. The exhibits are all well-done, and they encourage learning through fun and interaction. And I especially loved that the museum recognizes the important role women and POC writers have played in American history, and not just white male writers. Don't expect a huge museum, but if you embrace it for what it is, I hope you'll love it, also!",American Writers Museum,June 2019,50
Not to be missed!,Rebecca B,"I visited the museum before a Grant Park Orchestra concert at Millennium Park, and AWM was the highlight of the day. I've been to all of Chicago's grand old museum, and I was surprised at how AWM will definitely be an iconic museum, now and in the years to come. What was really cool, though, is how, here and there, visitors were striking up conversations with each other. Yeah, there were Educational Exhibits and the like, but visiting was also a really social thing. The exhibits are as polished as one would expect from a city that prides itself on its museum, except that AMW seems really hip. Maybe it's the typewriters from every decade or the Bob Dylan display, I don't know, but this is the only museum I could see myself at a date night, for what it's worth. By the way, I was here with teenagers, who got as much out of it as I did, so I can vouch for the hipness characteristic.",American Writers Museum,March 2019,50
A Hidden Gem in Chicago!,Ayisha T,Although it's kind of hard to locate the Writer's Museum is a must see in Chicago. The museum itself opened in 2017 and contains a pretty comprehensive history of American writing. The museum is little smaller than most but does a great job of summarizing some of our best writers and their work. When I visited there was a great Bob Dylan exhibit that is worth checking out. Great for adults and kids to visit. ,American Writers Museum,April 2019,50
Interesting Museum and Friendly Staff,Woodcut60,I particularly liked the wall with writing techniques and tips. Nice touch is the table with old typewriters (remember those?) where you can write your own little story. Bookmarks are complimentary which also was a nice touch.,American Writers Museum,July 2019,50
Writer and lover of prose,Marilyn H,It's a really nice little museum full of interesting information about American writers. I recommend it highly.,American Writers Museum,July 2019,50
Wonderful Restoration of Iconic Wright House,Johnji,"I grew up on Chicago’s South Side and have often visited the Robie House. Most of the times it was closed, in disarray or occupied by inappropriate organizations. It was also in a serious state of disrepair. No longer! It has now benefited from a multiyear restoration and what a feast to the eye and soul it has become. The guided tour (about 50 minutes) is a must. Kudos to all the donors that made this possible.",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,August 2019,50
"Great historical, beautiful building",Illinoisnow,"Be sure to do the noon tour. And BE ON TIME.  You'll learn the history, see the theater, and IF there is no performance being staged, you'll see the backstage area and get to go onstage. It is so great that this building was saved from the wrecking ball. Tour guide Hillary is great and really enlivens things.",The Chicago Theatre,October 2018,50
Interesting Tour,dominicemery,We did a 12pm tour of this fascinating building. The place is absolutely beautiful and has a great history. The tour takes you throughout the building and you even get to go on the stage!,The Chicago Theatre,October 2018,50
Great Venue!,BAKreiter,"I went here last night for the Goo Goo Dolls concert. It was my first time at this venue and I was very impressed! The architecture is beyond gorgeous and takes you back to another era. It reminds me of a smaller version of the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee. No bad seat in the place! Beers were only $8, for Chicago I was expecting higher prices and was pleasantly surprised with this. I will definitely be back to this venue in the future.",The Chicago Theatre,October 2018,50
Best Concerts and Plays,Jan R,I saw Kansas here in October and the music was awesome. I had a 3rd row seat in the Pit and couldn't have asked for a better seat.,The Chicago Theatre,October 2018,50
Dancing dolls ,johnnyboydc,I was in Chicago on business staying at the renaissance hotel.  I saw the marqui through my hotel window and saw that the dancing’s folks were performing that night.  I bought 1 ticket to see those talented young ladies.  I was impressed. The show was awesome and the theatre was very nice aesthetically. I enjoyed myself alone.  Those young ladies are well disciplined and very talented. ,The Chicago Theatre,July 2018,50
Wright's Last Design - An Unexpected Stop,C-02,"On our visit to Chicago, we were only going to visit one of the tours of Frank Lloyd Wright sites. The Robie House tours were sold out the day we tried, so we visited the FLW Home and Studio. We so thoroughly enjoyed that tour that we decided to try again to tour the Robie House. We ended up touring two sites of Frank Lloyd Wright's Trust - his first design and his last. We were so glad that we did. Our interpreter, Ms. Kim, was energetic and enthusiastic - a terrific tour!",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,August 2019,50
Stunning masterwork,Q6001KPnicolep,I love historic architecture and dragged my husband to the Robie house for a tour. It was well worth the $20 ticket price to see such an amazing home and FLW's work up close. The attention to detail and the newly completed restoration are fantastic. The docents are a wealth of knowledge and the 50 minute guided tour gives you so much insight into the design process and the history of the family and the house. So special!,Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,August 2019,50

Interesting architecture on Chicago University campus,C2E,"Mainly for architecture buffs - expecially fans of Frank Ll-W.  The house itself is well preserved and the guided tours are first class - just the right amount of information and anecdote.  The surrounding street are also pleasant and leafy - ideal for a miday stroll, and wit hmore architecture to admire.  A pleasant way to spend half a day out of the centre, depending on the weather.  The tour of teh house takes about an hour.",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,August 2019,50
A brief but very interesting tour and narrative.,asorrell,Note this is an interior alteration by FLW. The history of his engagement and the building adds colour. Go early and you have time for other things. ,The Rookery Building,June 2019,40
Good Architecture,Dr_Bob1,"A lovely lobby that has been revamped by Frank Lloyd Wright. Certainly worth a look. To my mind, looks more modern than it should.",The Rookery Building,June 2019,40

Beautiful old theater,97ozhappy,"Took a tour of this theater and was amazed at all the ornamentation and architecture. It was gone thru several renovations since it opened in 1926 but now ""looks"" like it did then. Huge theater with no pillars supporting the huge 3 tier balcony. Has an original Wurlitzer organ. Too bad the stage is small and can't host big theater productions, mainly concerts and the like. Got to go back stage and see some of the autographed walls and doors autographed by visiting artists including Bob Hope, the Rat Pack, Aretha Franklin, Carol Burnett, Bill Murry.",The Chicago Theatre,August 2018,50

Historic,ian_dempster,I only managed to go in the foyer but this theatre smells of history. I really only went to see the brilliant illuminated theatre sign.,The Chicago Theatre,August 2018,30
One of a kind,denisemT3534YA,"The Chicago theater is like stepping back in time, even though you're probably seeing a new band, and most people dress in contemporary clothing.  There are bars every 10 feet or so, it seems. The sound is the best on the main floor, so if you can afford it, sit there. It's always a fun outing when we have tickets here.  It's not a bad idea to start at Monk's Pub for a refreshing pop* (* by pop I mean beer) and /or sandwich beforehand. It's down the street and stuff. Anyway, the Chicago Theater is something to behold. So there ya go.",The Chicago Theatre,August 2018,50
"Great show, nice theatre ",Marissa E,"Thrilled to see Little Shop of Horrors here! When planning our trip to Chicago I was at first disappointed as there wasn’t anything I wanted to see as far as shows. Then I expanded my trip outside of the theaters directly downtown & found this gem of a theatre. It was still easily accessible even by metro (short walk from Wrigley Field). They were playing a favorite musical of ours & I saw good reviews on this site. The reviews are correct - great theatre with only good seats, amazing talent! Such an enjoyable evening! Go to this theatre!  ",The Mercury Theater,May 2019,50
Classic theater- great shows,Lyle B,"First time in the ""pit"" - first row chairs... was great to be there for Carol Burnett's one woman show.  And a nice bonus is being able to turn around and see the splendor of the whole theater. ",The Chicago Theatre,June 2018,50
"Great venue, excellent and eclectic line up",MyfanwyKonc,"We have seen many a comedian here, a couple movies with Q&A's and a few concerts here at the Chicago Theater. It's always a great time. It has a wonderful, cozy feel to it. I think tickets are usually reasonable as well as the concessions. I love the artists they have! Something for everyone. I also love that it is close to the L and has easy exits right out onto the sidewalk. ",The Chicago Theatre,April 2018,50
Love The Chicago Theater!,K I,Built in 1921. Been attending venues for years and feel like I walk back in time. This theater is beautiful and elegant. Sinatra and Dean Martin have performed here in the day. Nice seating. Located in the Loop area on North State street. Visitors need to experience this theater by going on the Marquee Tour and the Historic Theater tour of the Oriental theater.,The Chicago Theatre,June 2018,50

Chicago's history,Andre Z,"The Chicago Theatre, originally known as the Balaban and Katz Chicago Theatre, is a landmark theater located on North State Street in the Loop area of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. Built in 1921, from 1925 to 1945 the Chicago Theatre was a dominant movie theater enterprise. Currently, Madison Square Garden, Inc. owns and operates the Chicago Theatre as a performing arts venue for stage plays, magic shows, comedy, speeches, and popular music concerts.",The Chicago Theatre,July 2018,40
Chicago Theater at its Finest,345kenb,"Saw Christmas Schooner and loved the show. Good location with numerous nearby restaurants. Great website and wonderful staff and atmosphere. I would suggest Ubering to the show. Parking is a challenge. If u drive, arrive early and valet. ",The Mercury Theater,December 2017,50
Fun and different way to watch a game!,Erin R,"I attended a work event at one of the rooftops on Sheffield. The building itself is very nice and clean. Most of the staff was courteous and food/drink service was good! I definitely still prefer watching a Cubs game from inside the stadium rather than watching from afar, but this is a great place to get a big group together and enjoy nice weather and good baseball!",Wrigley View Rooftop,May 2017,40
Beautiful Histiorial Setting for a concert!,Karla H,"We saw Pentatonix at Chicago Theatre at Christmas time; Chicago is always so beautiful lit up for Christmas, but this theatre is just so very beautiful.  The Pentatonix concert was beautiful, great view of stage and great sound!",The Chicago Theatre,August 2017,50
Beautiful and Amazing,Lisa H,The architecture in this theater is beautiful and amazing. If we didn’t have a show I could have walked around just to see all the details. Our seats were comfortable and I don’t think there is a bad seat in the place. They had snacks and alcohol beverages available the night we were there not sure if that is for every event.,The Chicago Theatre,April 2018,50
Wizard of Oz,Mar L,"The theatre is a 5 star and the Wizard of Oz show that we saw was a 3 so I am giving a 4.  The theatre is amazing. The show was kind of LOUD to the point of annoying. I don't think so much screeching was necessary.  However, the special effects and costumes were excellent. They used a real live puppy for the part of Toto which we found really sad because that poor animal was just abused with all the noise and being tossed and dragged around that stage. A stuffed animal would have been much kinder.",The Chicago Theatre,May 2018,40

Great event!,balld31,"While in Chicago for a training class, the social event was attending a Cubs game on Wrigley Rooftops. It's was a great experience and one I would certainly do again.  Great seats, no fighting over bathrooms, no long concession lines, etc....but I'd still like to see a game inside Wrigley at some point.  :-)",Wrigley View Rooftop,September 2016,50

Take the tour it is so worth it!,firebird350,"I took the 12:00pm tour that takes place every day at the Chicago Theatre.  I have lived in the area my whole life and have only been to that theatre twice and don't really remember it.  The tour is inexpensive and only about an hour.  It was very informative and you got to go to places that you would not normally (dressing rooms, stage and backstage).  The history is fascinating, the decor is something to be seen.  I think it is is ready for another ""refresh"" since it has been since the mid 80's since the it was last updated.  However, it is really worth the time to go.  Only downfall of the tour, they take large crowds and our guide though very knowledgeable was at times very difficult to understand because of the size of our group.  But she was very fun and entertaining throughout the tour.  A definite must do!",The Chicago Theatre,March 2018,50

Lovely area to walk,callaOttawa_Ontario,An easy El and bus ride from downtown and worth the effort.  An elegant neighbourhood to walk through and home to Frank Lloyd Wright's fantastic Robie House and the leafy campus of the University of Chicago. A short walk up to the Museum of Industry - worth even just a look if you have read The Devil in the White City.,Hyde Park,September 2014,50
Local Theater At Its Best,Motherjudge,"The Man Who Murdered Sherlock Holmes was absolutely AMAZING!  I love all things Sherlock (except the Robert Downey Movies - Ugh). So I was excited to see a live play about him.  I thought that a play that focused on the aftermath of his ""demise"" at the hands of his creator was very intriguing.  I was a bit skeptical of how it would work as a musical, but it was brilliantly done.  The singing was wonderful. The dialogue/lyrics were clever.  The storyline was interesting and addressed some topical issues. The gentleman who plays Sherlock was not the best singer, but he was so perfect as Sherlock in every other was that I gladly overlooked his singing ability (or lack thereof).  The show was so good, that I basically encouraged everyone I know to see it.",The Mercury Theater,February 2016,50
Amazing time   Great way to see the game,JohnfmBrooklyn,"I went there to see a game with a group of ten friends.   The food was amazing.   Cold beer, plenty of tv's and seats to see the game.   You can actually see the whole field from this location.  I'll be back.  Highly recommend.",Wrigley View Rooftop,June 2016,50
Part of History,robinm431,I could have paid a lot less and went into the stadium for a better view and paid the high prices for he same food and broke even.  I would recommend it only if the price was comparable to the amenities offered.,Wrigley View Rooftop,October 2015,30
Tedeschi trucks band,jdzimme3,Music was fantastic.  Second section of balcony sound was great.  Venue could use a little refurbishing.,The Chicago Theatre,January 2018,40
No bad seats,AltenStudio,"Classic looking venue. Perhaps a bit rough around the edges with some peeling paint but this venue has been well attended and well used. We had seats near the back of the main floor off to the side, that were considered to have a possibly obstructed view. No such thing. Sound quality and balance were amazing. Nice and pleasant security (also efficient!) and friendly ushers/ staff.",The Chicago Theatre,January 2018,40

Very pleasant,andrew j,"Hyde park is mostly residential and home to the university of chicago. While there, we noticed how clean and quiet the area is. We felt safe walking around the side streets and even enjoyed an open house. It gave us a chance to see the condition of the older homes from the inside. We went to the robie house and oriental institute museum. The only sketchy part was the wait for the train at the end of the green line in cottage grove.",Hyde Park,September 2012,40
Snooze,Maggie G,"Sure the University of Chicago is an idyllic campus.  However, there;s really not much to do.  A scattering of restaurants that close at 9pm.  Raccoons in the street.

Wrigleyville Rooftops Chicago,Mary B,"My girlfriends and I wanted to experience watching a Cubs game from the rooftops before they are done away with.   IT WAS GREAT!   We had a great time.   Pricey BUT it was all the beer and all the food plus the game.   I'm also not sure if we had bought a ticket to the game and then bought food and beer at the game if the price wouldn't have even out to about the same.   However, it rained for about three hours, right after the 3rd inning and there was a long delay before the game continued so hey we were dry.   The inside area was great for watching the Little League World Series on all their TV's.   The food was great, the service was wonderful and courteous, the beer was cold.   What more could I ask for.",Wrigley View Rooftop,August 2014,50
fun option,kjoy95,"While it's always great to watch a game from seats as close to the field as possible, this is truly a fun alternate option. All you can eat and drink provides for lots of fun. The rooftops allow for a fun atmosphere where you are not feeling confined to an assigned seat. Beware, the food does not provide any healthy options and yes, there are options but these are limited. Also, there are beer options but not endless options. If you are okay with the basics of beer, you will not be phased. The bartender said wine was also available but reported it wasn't the greatest quality.",Wrigley View Rooftop,August 2014,40
Brewers Game,mlewis1,"Wanted to try a rooftop game for years and finally went on May 2nd.  Food was average, hot dogs, etc.  For the 1:20 p.m. game, didn't open bar until 1:00 p.m., so we waited 15 minutes.  Bar service fine.  A lot of people there so it made moving around hard.  View from top bar was poor.  We couldn't see batter or hear the intercom (top pictures says it all).  TV picture wasn't on on top floor, only radio.  Just one bathroom stall per floor (not counting the top) so I waited a few times (need bigger bathrooms).  We tried it and it is now off the list.  Next time, will go to inside stadium.  It will probably be cheaper too.  Discount tickets were still around $110 after taxes.  Looked like other rooftops had a better view, but we don't know that.",Wrigley View Rooftop,May 2015,30
A cool baseball experience,RIT17,"The place we were at included the indoor bar area (no real view to Wrigley from there), the upstairs rooftop patio where the BBQ is and where they serve food and drinks. The view is better than below, but still had the obstacle of the new scoreboard in front of us. However, if you go up and sit on the bleachers above the patio, the view into centerfield and the infield is pretty good. It is not the same as being inside the stadium, but a different experience worth trying. The price includes food and beer, but the food is quite average. Hot dogs, sausages, burgers, tacos. Nothing much to get excited about. It would be better if they at least toasted the buns! Go for the good experience, but the quality of food brings my rating down to just average.",Wrigley View Rooftop,May 2015,30
Consistently excellent plays - not a bad seat in the house!,Jennyryanchicago,"We have seen two plays at the Mercury over the last year and both were outstanding!

The University of Chicago campus is lovely in any season, and if you're at all interested in American architecture, you have to make the pilgrimage to see Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House.

YASSSS Go!  It's an intersection of art and science!,PuffyP12,"As a middle-aged couple, we weren't sure what we were in for when we walked up and stood in line with everyone much younger than us. We were promptly greeted, told what to do in a friendly way, and set free.  And OMG we LOVED IT!  (Especially me, but my husband agreed that it was good!)  It's an intersection of art and science, and the staff totally geeked out on the areas that they were staffing and made it very interesting and exciting for us.  They were smart, enthusiastic, cute, and earnest. The museum itself was so hands-on and would excite even the most bored/skeptical teenager or middle-aged husband.  We had fun!  Expensive for 1-2 hours, but in my opinion totally worth it.  Go!   ",wndr museum,January 2019,50
Candy for the eyes and camera,496markc,What a fun time for kids of all ages. We loved the whimsical displays and fun facts. Took about 90 minutes to tour. The timed entries assured no lines or crowds. ,wndr museum,February 2019,50
Not your typical museum a great interaction place,Wendy W,"Not your typical museum but really creatively and artistically done.  We spent an hour here and loved every minute.  A great interactive place where you can take great pictures. Loved the infinity room at the end.  A bit pricey at 32 bucks each.  And you have to buy your tickets in advance, and have a specified time to arrive.  Only issue is no parking anywhere just street parking",wndr museum,February 2019,50
Can't go wrong,Catescatescates,"With all you can eat and drink, you can actually get a cheaper experience outside of the ballpark.  But it is no substitute if you have never been in the friendly confines.  ",Wrigley View Rooftop,June 2012,50

Well worth the trip from downtown!,jstoll21,Small theater so really no bad seat. We had front row--close enough one could reach out and touch the actors but you do get a little neck strain from looking up. Recommend 3rd row back. We saw Ring of Fire which was a tremendous story/tribute of Johnny Cash. 6 performers and all excellent. Last year we saw Barnum which was very good. We visit Chicago every summer and will be sure to check what's playing at the Mercury again next year. I definitely prefer seeing extremely talented  entertainers up close vs. seeing a celebrity in a large venue. Tango Sur is great Argentinean restaurant next door to have dinner before the show--see my review.,The Mercury Theater,June 2015,50

Good one time experience,Jim G,"A fun way to watch a ball game, but if you are a real fan and want a major league experience, in the park is the best way to go. The food is good, but so are the hot dogs at Wrigley. This was my first cubs game in many years. I would have preferred to be in the park with a full-field view. Most of the people were more interested in socializing than baseball. For the money, choose the bleachers. B",Wrigley View Rooftop,July 2012,30

Ring of Fire,mps1992,"After the show we walked over to Wrigley Field and had dinner at Goose Island (so that we could avoid the 5pm rush hour traffic).

Nice night out!,cptquinlan,"Saw Ring of Fire, and it was so good!  I liked over Million Dollar Quartet just because loved the single focus on Johnny Cash.  All players were great.

The productions are always top-notch with Equity Actors and talented staff and musicians. Ticket prices are reasonable and the ticketing staff are very helpful and clear.

Best way to see the Cubs,ALD0410,Nothing can beat free food and drink up on the rooftops to see the Cubs. There are multiple companies and a lot of Groupons in the summertime. They are generally cheaper late in the season when the Cubs start losing a lot.,Wrigley View Rooftop,August 2011,50

You're not exactly in the stadium.,Laura K,"Seeing this view is cool if you live in Chicago, and have been to Wrigley a million times.  It's a great way to see Wrigley at a different angle.  Unfortunately, the radio is on a delay, so you see th eplay and hear the crowd and then 5 second later, you hear what happened.  Also, at this angle, you can't see what's happening if a ball goes near the outfield wall.",Wrigley View Rooftop,August 2011,30

Christmas Schooner musical was great at the Mercury,685philipp,"We really enjoyed the Christmas Schooner musical at this small theater. Excellent sight lines and very good venue for those that appreciate the smaller venues.  Also, there are two restaurants/bars on either side.  It The show we saw is a great Christmas standard that is about Chicago and a different experience than the other Christmas shows in town. ",The Mercury Theater,December 2014,40
Christmas Schooner - Amazing,samalamagurl,"I've come to the Mercury theater the last 3 years to see the Christmas Schooner with my family. It's the wonderful award winning tale/musical of how Christmas trees first came to Chicago - and the family who started it. The theater is intimate - so you feel like you are on stage with the crew. It's rather easy to get to from the highway, and there is plenty of public parking lots in the area - if you know where to find them and get there early enough. There are also a few cafes/coffee shops nearby to spend a few minutes before the show begins. It's intimate enough to be romantic, but the story and actors are so good that even small children are rapt with attention the whole time. YOU SHOULD GO see it.",The Mercury Theater,December 2014,50
A must see for December in Chicago!,irinosky,I went with my family to see the Christmas Schooner and it was a delight! The theater is small but cozy and very charming and the play was simply great!

"Small theater, big experience ",OAhlgrim,"This was my first visit to the Mercury Theater. It is difficult to separate the theater from the production experience. So I'll take care of that first, the musical we saw, The Man Who Shot Sherlock Holmes, was superb. The acting was first class, the music was fun, appropriate to the subject, and the lyrics were extremely clever.  There were a few serious moments but it was mostly non-stop fun.  The theater is very intimate. I found the seats comfortable. So was the climate control-- comfortable and never felt closed in or stuffy. The theater personnel from box office to ushers were friendly and upbeat. I certainly will keep a watch on what's playing and definitely want to plan a return trip. We had a wonderful evening at the Mercury!",The Mercury Theater,March 2016,50

Easy to get to...,Elaine K,We ate at the restaurant on the right of the Mercury.   We had a drink on the left side.   We saw Avenue Q.   A great lively production.  We especially enjoyed Leah Morrow as Katie Monster but the whole cast was delightful.   We hiked back to the Subway and were soon back to our hotel downtown.   No taxi or parking problem.

Hidden Gem!,GBPackerFan4evah,"This is a fantastic little gem! We paid $12 to valet park and that came In handy since there was a baseball game that night and not a parking spot to be found. The theatre is very small and intimate.  Feels like among family and friends.  There is an Irish pub hooked to it, which came in handy at intermission. We paid $45 a ticket to see Avenue Q and it was so worth it. Seats were just a few rows from the stage and we had purchased them only two days before at the last minute. I can't wait to see another production at this venue! You really can't get a bad seat, not even in the balcony. I felt like I was in someone's living room.",The Mercury Theater,July 2014,50

2.5 Stars,Jacqueline C,"2. The price. The price for this museum is just off the charts. $32. When you think of what you get at the Art Institute, Field Museum, etc. for similar money, $32 for this feels like a rip-off. You won’t really spend much more than an hour or two (at the most) here. This is basically an Instagram museum. Very gimmicky.",wndr museum,March 2019,20

Drop your cash elsewhere!,DawnB78,"Cons...too many to list! First, let’s confirm that this is not a museum. You will not learn anything. It is for fun and great photo ops. Which brings me to the next con. Waiting for everyone to take family pictures in different positions. The reps first tell you not to miss anything in the first room. Huh? None of the displays make any sense what exactly are we going to miss? We walked the tour bewildered thinking why did we just spend this much money for this. The room reps talked so quietly and when asked what their room represented they could hardly describe it and they surely didn’t believe in what they were saying. You can have a person type a poem for you on an old typewriter and pick it up at the end of your tour. The best rooms were the Ames room and the mirror ball room. We had to wait in line for all the fam ops, put footies on and we could only spend 1 minute in the mirror ball room. And can someone please  tell me why a security guard is in this room? Is there someone famous hiding between the balls? By then we were done but lo and behold it takes us to the “gift shop” which was hard to tell it was a gift shop. The machine that dispensed tea was out of order, the store was only taking cash since their credit card machine was down. The tattoo shop wasn’t open.

Lovely Theater,illinoistraveler25,"We went to see The Christmas Schooner at this theater.  What a wonderful experience! We were pleasantly surprised with the theater; it is a small theater that gives you a warm comfortable feeling when you walk in.  The play was fantastic and now I understand why people have made this a family tradition, we would like to see the play again next year!  We used valet parking for $14 and it was well worth it, the valet service had our car waiting for us when we left the theater.  There is a restaurant/bar attached to the theater which is convenient if you would like to eat before watching a show. They did not sell any snacks during intermission but you can buy drinks from the bar area and bring them in the theater. The theater is in a lovely area; we would like to go back in the spring or summer time because there are many shops and restaurants in the area to visit.",The Mercury Theater,December 2013,50
Great night watching Avenue Q,AndrewF78,"Great set up, the theatre is set up between an Irish bar and a restaurant on a nice street which on a warmer day I am sure would be good to walk along. The show was very funny and would recommend it (not for children) to groups or a couple. Both places either side will serve you drinks in go cups. We were at the back and still had good views for around $30.00 a person. ",The Mercury Theater,April 2014,50

Great space for many types of events,Tom B,I have attended everything from chamber music to opera here and have thoroughly enjoyed each performance.

Great Venue,The_Road_Warrior_63,Went here for a performance of Handel's Messiah  Got tickets at the last minute so we were on the far side of the upper orchestra. It didn't matter a bit.

Great stories about the ushers and acts that appeared there. It was fun to stand on the empty stage and see the dressing room (where Dean Martin yelled down to girls in the alley).

"Fantastic, Unique and Highly Entertaining Upscale Dinner Theater in Chicago",DonnaM62,I have seen the show several times and look forward to seeing it again. The cast will change up every 6 months bringing new performances so you can see it often.,Teatro Zinzanni,July 2019,50
Top 10 Things to Do In Chicago!!,afleischer2018,"This is like going to a show and a nice dinner rolled into one, but the size of the venue makes it not crowded, no lines, no hassle and just a fantastic evening.  Although many of the performers are international, together they present a wonderful representation of all that is Chicago— whether you are just visiting or planning a night downtown. ",Teatro Zinzanni,August 2019,50
"Love, Chaos & dinner",Caroltinley,"This is three hours of fun and good food. I took my family of four to celebrate my 50th Wedding anniversary. It was a feast for the eyes and ears.  The performers are all talented veterans, The serving staff is as well, the band is great, the food is really very good and comes from ""They girl & the grocery.",Teatro Zinzanni,August 2019,50
What a Venue!,Boystowtraveler,"If you happen to book a show at this venue, you won't be disappointed as you can see so nicely from almost any vantage point. Of course, if you happen to sit in the nose bleed seats (highest up) you will still see okay, but it's a long way to the front! Seats and legroom are comfortable. Temp was perfect. I would highly recommend this venue.",Harris Theater,December 2013,50
A theater underground?  Surprising nice dungeon.  Fun venue.,GreeneChicago,"After the show, because it the garage was connected to the entrance, it was easy to get out of the venue, to the garage, and on the road home.  I didn't even get snow on me until I got home.  Great perk during the Chicago winter.",Harris Theater,December 2013,50
access from street level,norah50,"Street level entrance is a five floor hike to the orchestra seating, elevators restricted to wheel-chair handicap (Feb 2014).   If stairs are an issue, check with box office before buying a seat.  Balcony is a looooong way up from stage.  Comfortable seats, great sound.   My row G orchestra seat was visually blocked by a taller adult in front of me, I was able to move further to side.  Drinks & food are permitted in the theater, personally I don't care to have things spilled on me, or have to deal with an adjoining seat's trash. Is it possible to make it through an hour or so and enjoy refreshments and conversation at intermission?  Excellent venue.",Harris Theater,February 2014,40
Great performing arts venue,DebOChicago_IL,"I suppose there must be bad seats at the Harris Theater, but in nearly ten years of attending events here I've yet to sit in one.  This is a great place to see dance and listen to music.  ",Harris Theater,February 2014,50
Wonderful performance by Thodos Dance Chicago!,LouisvilleQuest,"We enjoyed Thodos Dance's Winter Concert at the Harris Theater.  The first act of A Light in the Dark was the beautiful story of Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan- very touching and with great dance performances.  The theater was a great venue for it, and was close to many other downtown Chicago sites.  ",Harris Theater,March 2014,50
Worst Birthday Ever - Check Your Food For Plastic,shellyc653,"This was the worst birthday experience of my life. First, there were several pieces of plastic found in my dinner entree. Our waitress only came by once to take our drink order. She only came around the second time after my husband got up during the show to find a manager to deal with the plastic issue. The waitress had a bad attitude and was inept at her job. The response we received from someone from the kitchen was that there is plastic everywhere in the kitchen and not to worry because it was not a health risk. That is absolutely absurd and unacceptable. This is absolutely a health risk and I think the health department should be brought in to investigate. In addition to this, I want to address what I consider religious persecution. I can deal with sexual innuendo as well as risque material. However, it is completely unacceptable to mock holy communion on stage and for the host to take the Lord's name in vain multiple times. I wanted to walk out but it was dark and there were steps with actors all around. I did not want to bump into a server or actor or fall during the show as I'm visually impaired.  I was completely and utterly offended as any references to religion are not mentioned in the show description. I was taken completely off guard.  Our view was obstructed and it appears they gave us the worst seats possible as it was hard to see anything with the actors backs to us almost the entire time. There was an empty table in front of us that they could have easily given us so I could see better but the staff doesn’t really care about anything going on here. Between the lack of service, the ineptness of the staff, the unnecessary and improper religious references and the fact I could have swallowed plastic pieces during dinner, this was an incredible disappointment and a waste of over $240 not including added gratuity. I would never recommend this show to anyone. I also don't trust the shows that Goldstar offers because of this experience. The people responsible for this debacle of a show took no responsibility for what happened and I don't appreciate it. The entire experience was a nightmare that I hope to soon forget.",Teatro Zinzanni,August 2019,10
Couples bonding time,ciastko83,We had a great time.  We missed the first wndr experience and had to join in the second.  It was a blast full of interesting and fun exhibits.

Truly amazing.  Lots of fun.,William-Illinois,Very cool.  Highly recommend.,wndr museum,June 2019,40
A rip-off if there ever was one,jryanryan,"An expensive rip-off. First of all the price, $ 32 for a mini-museum with 1 worthwhile exhibit (Infinity Room), second you cannot buy a ticket at the museum, but must sit on the sidewalk get onto their site and buy a ticket plus an “entertainment tax”, so the price on the website, already expensive, is not all you pay. Once inside there is basically a bunch of color, some lights, a few semi-interesting exhibits.  No more than 15 minutes worth of entertainment. Stay away from this place, better things to spend your money on. It’s a place people go and take selfies.",wndr museum,June 2019,20
What a wonderful new age museum,L3979GBchrisw,"Really liked this experience.  Soak it all in.  Look in it, stand on it,  get into it.  Reminds me a lot of the Meow Wolf exhibit in Santa Fe.  Made me dream, dance, smile.  Would have a membership here if I lived in Chicago.  Great staff too!",wndr museum,July 2019,50
Quite impressive,dvkremk,"During Chicago Open House we were able to view the sky chapel, the outdoor patio and the sanctuary on the first floor.  All spaces were quite impressive.  Beautiful stained glass windows in the chapel and sanctuary.  There are also guided tours at 2 PM during the week.  Check their website.",Chicago Temple,October 2015,50
Methodist skyscraper,Rolf A,"At 568 feet, this is a skyscraper church built on the same site where in 1832/1833, the Methodists built their first church in Chicago. There is a large chapel on the ground floor and a small one at the foot of the spire, high above Chicago. The spire chapel is accessible only by tour which is every weekday afternoon starting at 2. The stained glass in the ground floor chapel is dramatically back lit. ",Chicago Temple,November 2015,50
"Wow, there are two chapels in this building: on the ground and on the very top!",O6378WFannag,The large chapel is accessible all the time and the chapel which is located on the very top (accessible by very narrow stairs and partially by small elevator) is accessible only once a day (weekdays at 2pm) with tours. It is worth it to climbed out there. You will learn that founder of Walgreen's was one of the major benefactors of this building.,Chicago Temple,October 2015,50
The building that once was Chicago's tallest,Taylor B,"Located at the southeast corner of Clark and Washington across the street from the Richard J. Daley Center, the Chicago Temple Building at 77 West Washington is dwarfed by the city's skyscrapers and often judged to be just another office building. In fact, it is 568 feet tall, home to the congregation of the First United Methodist Church of Chicago and is the tallest church building in the world based on the distance from the church's street level entrance to the top of the church's spire or steeple. It was completed in 1924, has 23 floors dedicated to religious and office use and was Chicago's tallest building until 1930 when it was surpassed by the Chicago Board of Trade. The building is constructed on a steel frame faced with limestone and is designed in the neo-gothic style. It houses three sanctuaries: Sanctuary 1 is four stories tall on the ground floor with seating available for 1,000 people and is accessible all the time, Sanctuary 2 is known as the ""Dixon Chapel"" and is on the second floor and is accessible only at 2 p.m. weekdays with tours, and Sanctuary 3 is known as the ""Sky Chapel"" is situated at the base of the steeple with seating for only 30 people. The Sky Chapel was created in 1952 as a gift from the Walgreen family in memory of Charles Walgreen, the founder of the drugstore chain bearing his name. At 400 feet above ground level, it is considered the world's highest worship space and contains 16 stained glass windows. A sculpture entitled Miro's Chicago by Joan Miro occupies a courtyard between the Chicago Temple and the adjacent George Dunne Cook County Building. Historians also will be interested to know that the sixth floor of the building once held the office of Clarence Darrow, the famous trial attorney.",Chicago Temple,April 2016,50
Gorgeous architecture,lafter0,"The name ""Chicago Temple"" is misleading, because this is actually a Methodist church. The tour includes the sanctuary on the ground floor as well as the chapel at the top of the building. Both are gorgeous, but the history of the building is absolutely fascinating. The tour is better when there are fewer people, because there are space constraints. It can take multiple elevator trips for the full group to assemble at the top. I recommend this for anyone who is interested in architecture and Chicago city history.",Chicago Temple,September 2015,40
Great Venue!,flygirl529,"The best thing is that there are no bad sight lines.  I have sat as close as 5 rows from the stage, far right on the floor, and in the balcony.  Its a ""smaller"" theater which allows you to be close to the action and the ticket prices are very reasonable even for the best seats. The theater is in Mellinium Park, which is it self a destination not to be missed, and I always have dinner at Park Grille before a show.  The restaurant is great and its only a 2 minute walk to the theater.",Harris Theater,November 2011,40

Odd but Fabulous Theater,Lorry T,"The Harris is an odd place to see events like classical ballet. But it is also a really wonderful theater. It looks like a giant garage, all cement and flourescent lights! The seating looks like something you might find in a ballpark. The stage is small and the acoustics, speakers, rigging, etc is all exposed. They even have people walking around selling water and Chardonnay! It's very strange. At the same time, the seating is perfectly raked for a great view. The small but deep stage allows for a very intimate experience. The acoustics are wonderful allowing the orchestra to literally fill the theater with sound like a bowl. And the staff at the Harris are positively lovely. It is a wonderful place to see any performance and I highly recommend it!",Harris Theater,July 2012,50

The glass for these mosaics was made of pure quartz silica from Ottawa, IL. and has more sparkle than any other Tiffany mosaic.",Marquette Building,April 2017,50
Lovely neighborhood to explore,Elizabeth O,I had the pleasure of staying here in august and it's a nice neighborhood. I wanted to do an actual walking tour but my timing was off. Luckily the friend I stayed with was able to give me the unofficial nitty gritty of the area. There is a variety of restaurants to fit just about any taste. I agree there are some sketchy areas but as long as you keep your wits about yourself you'll be fine.

Good theater for dance and ensemble presentations.,TomGin,The Harris Theater is a mid-sized theater that has a lot going for it. The stage is perfect for small dance and ensemble presentations.

"A Very Industrial Design, Comfortable, Good Views",BradS922,"The entries at all the levels are very spartan, industrial design with exposed pipes, concrete, ducts and such. Total opposite of opulent opera houses or theater district hot spots. Once inside, the theater itself follows the same theme with zero decoration. The layout provides good views from just about any seat, not a huge facility with good acoustics. We enjoyed the Hubbard Street Dance group collaborating with The Second City players. ",Harris Theater,June 2016,40
Historic venue in downtown Chicago,raharrington85,"The Chicago Theater marquee is iconic and a must-do picture spot, especially with the name of a favorite personality in lights. On entry, the security was thorough, and the ticket checking was quick. The venue was a bit of a maze to find bathrooms and our appointed door into the main auditorium, and there was staff standing and circulating among the crowd to help us find what we were looking for when were lost (definitely got lost looking for the bathrooms). The bathrooms were clean but maybe somewhat small. The outer areas included refreshment vendors. The auditorium was beautiful with a historic ambiance but felt worn. The staff were very helpful in getting to our seats, and our seating was a little tight but comfortable enough. The sound system was adequate, but the squeaking of random seats throughout our event was extremely distracting. Once our event was over, the exiting was fairly quick and efficient. Overall, I’d rate this a fine venue.",The Chicago Theatre,April 2018,30

Different type of experience,nezd2016,"I personally like being in Wrigley but this was a corporate event. It was a good way to  interact with everyone but you miss out on that baseball feel.

This is a relaxed atmosphere theater located in a nice neighborhood near Wrigley with top-notch actors. Even most of the patrons are friendly. Wear comfortable clothes.

The evening was full of laughter and excitement....as well as delicious cheesecake.

Amazing Experience,ChicagoFemale,This show is pure joy from start to finish and largely due to the performers and staff.

Picturesque & Groomed,MelNew14,"Hyde Park is a diverse place with many landmarks. The University of Chicago, The Robe House, Washington Park, and Obama's home. Our walk on guide toured us through this area of the city.  Definitely built up with the University of Chicago.",Hyde Park,May 2016,40
Nice area,EBTravelGirl,Strolled through here on my way to a museum. It's a very nice and well maintained area. I was even able to enjoy an arts fair along the way. ,Hyde Park,June 2016,30
Beautiful homes!!,tralancey,Loved the homes in this and the connecting neighborhood.  Will not mention the names of the homes that I seen; out of respect for the owners.  Could not get to close to some areas due to Secret Service....and that was fine too.,Hyde Park,October 2016,50
The Harris Theater is modern and has good acoustics but has problems with the upper balcony,Janet H,"The upper balcony has its own restrooms for men and women, which is convenient.  However, this area of the Harris Theater has no drinking fountains.  I found the lack of water annoying.  A theater employee was selling water and soft drinks during the intermission; however, I do not think that theatergoers should have to pay for water.",Harris Theater,October 2017,40
Great Family Shows,RoadTrip60076,We have had a subscription to the family series for the last 4 or 5 years. We enjoy the hour long shows with a variety of entertainers. Seats are reasonable and there's often a chance to hang out with the performers after the performance.,Harris Theater,October 2017,50
Great Location: Right On the North End of Millenium Park,493Ron,"The Harris Theater is yet another venue that makes Millenium Park a great gathering spot in the heart of Chicago. This was my first visit here - I never knew there was a theater in Millenium Park. This is not a super-glamorous place: concrete abounds. When you are walking through the corridors you get the feeling you are in a giant basketball arena. If you take the stairs you climb and climb and climb. They must have elevators but I didn't see any. Still, I'm glad to see an indoor performing arts space in Millenium Park.",Harris Theater,February 2018,40
The Harris Theatre- Alswys A Great Seat,T4934YHandrewh,"The Harris Theatre for music and dance has perfect acoustics, no view barriers and no matter where you sit, you can hear well and see well.  Balcony seats or orchestra seats, it does not matter.  And they have the best artists in Dance and Music performing there.  Truly a great venue and a great addition to the Millenium Park area.  Enjoy a walk in the park or on the Lakefront before the show.",Harris Theater,March 2018,50
"The theatre building may not be very good, but many of the performances are fabulous!",Leonard K,"Nevertheless...if the performance is one worth seeing, the Harris Theater will certainly suffice!",Harris Theater,March 2018,50
Fun spot,Julianne C,"Beautiful building with plenty of history.  We saw Wizard of Oz there and enjoyed it very much.  Nice downtown location, comfortable seats and very clean, pleasant atmosphere.  Security was a little tough, but that is to be expected these days.  We will be back!",The Chicago Theatre,May 2018,40
A great night ruined by bad management,Indytravs,"The unfortunate situation here is that the day to day staff was quite pleasant. The manager, Ken, who apparently managed this specific building was wildly rude. We had a group of 20 that had an average age of 60. Tonight was a nice break from a normal conference room for us. This was not a frat party. Please....find somewhere else. ",Wrigley View Rooftop,July 2017,10
Guess a Chicago baseball bucket club thing,rnarisetti,"A hike up the stairs gets you to a couple of bars with the very stadium-like drinks and food (hotdogs, burgers chips, nachos) before a climb up to the bleachers on the roof. The 1032 W. Waveland version of this had great views and it is a fun even if not particularly comfortable outing that seems quite popular with groups. Very friendly staff and not too crowded and unlimited (or at least part of the ticket) drinks and food.",Wrigley View Rooftop,August 2017,30
Another free activity in Chicago!,Abdul M,"It is summer in Chicago and there are a lot of things to do, for free! In the previous reviews I shared some activities that are free, this is also a free ""entrance"" activity to do (in July). If you are a foodie, you will love this! Taste of Chicago has a lot of food restaurant showing off their dishes for your taste buds--the entrance is FREE! One thing is that you have buy tickets to buy food. 14 tickets = 10 dollars. My recommendation is spending only $50 to buy tickets if you are a foodie (for two people), things are kind of expensive so you have to choose what you want to eat (Pizza, ice cream, hot dogs, fish, Taste of Texas, etc). For example, one meal or one full portion would cost you around 7 to 10 tickets. So look around, walk around and pick what you like to eat. If you like to stay for the evening, there is a concert event as well to make your evening delightful.  Also, there are various ticket booths to buy, bathrooms, it is connected with Millennium Park, also, Buckingham Fountain (both are free activities to do as well), both are on the opposite sides. It is great for families, with kids... if you are on vacation, have an umbrella with a bottle of water to walk around during lunch time, the sun is strong but that just adds to the fun. In addition, there was zipping lining and for kids other activities.   I recommend taking the bus if you are not in Downtown, #147 (others are #151, the red line, etc.) would drop you right by the taste! If you are in Chicago, enjoy this event!",Taste of Chicago,July 2018,40
"Cool, but expensive",W7035THjosephl,"Take a hat, water, a blanket (to sit in the wooded areas), and wet naps/towelettes are a plus. ",Taste of Chicago,July 2018,30

Nobody warn us about Diamon Resorts “free vacation” lies at Taste of Chicago,AJRoca,I’m afraid we just lost $149 dollars.

A quick google search on bad business practices from this company is overwhelming. Please do reasearch before giving your information!!!!,Taste of Chicago,July 2018,10
Great alternative,Johnnybarfly,"Friends recommended trying the rooftop and it was fantastic. The view was outstanding and easy access to food, drinks and washrooms. It was full due to the Blue Jays being in town, but I would recommend going early to grab a good spot on the rooftop. It is a pricey seat, but with drinks and food included and no line-ups it is a great way to see a game. ",Wrigley View Rooftop,August 2017,50
Tickets cancelled,weegans,"We purchased tickets for Tues Aug 29th rooftop viewing cubs v pirates with Wrigley view rooftops a month in advance of the game through wrigley view's website. They notified us after we'd already headed to chicago on our trip that they would not open their rooftop for this game because they did not sell enough tickets. We were able to get on another rooftop through wrigleyrooftops.com, although much of their selection was now gone, but I would suggest just going to wrigleyrooftops.com first. Their website is much better and they've provided us with an excellent experience twice. Wrigley View jacked us around a bit for the world series so we watched it on a wrigleyrooftops.com rooftop as well. The Cubs own all of the rooftops on wrigleyrooftops.com. We wanted to support this independent owner, but sadly they are just not cutting it. They appeared to be closed for the Monday game as well. Just be aware that if you book with them, your event may or may not happen. You need to have a back up plan or just don't use them at all.",Wrigley View Rooftop,August 2017,10

"A Totally mad experience of “Love, Chaos, and Dinner”",SuzanneetRon,"There is a lot of audience participation and masterful gymnastics from the ceiling and on the raised center stage.  This is probably not a show for children under 12 with the sexual nuances, but everything is done in really good taste.  Really, really good.",Teatro Zinzanni,November 2019,50
Spotlight on YOU,chasjfish,"This show relies FAR TOO MUCH on compelling audience members onto the stage, or otherwise working the crowd in a harassing manner. Also, the content is not appropriate for those under 18. There are beautiful moments in this production, but if you would rather see a show than BE the show, see Cirque Du Soleil instead (or at least take seating in the outer booths). This show does include dinner, which underwhelmed. A cast member worked a metal scalp massager over my head, then did the same with several other audience members by surprise, and the problems with this stem from both consent and hygiene. I am not planning to return.",Teatro Zinzanni,November 2019,20
"Laughter, awe and good food",andietx,"My college age daughter and I went to the brunch performance during our mini Thanksgiving holiday in Chicago and had a wonderful memorable experience with excellent food. This cabaret style show has a funny and engaging host (Kevin Kent aka Doilee) and an outstanding cast of singers, acrobats and all-around entertainers. Yes, audience members are pulled into the show - but that’s part of the cabaret style. It also adds to the unpredictability and feeds the improv. Go to the show and have an unforgettable experience for yourself. ",Teatro Zinzanni,November 2019,50
Outstanding Event!,Kathleen D,Well worth the money for a great night out. (This venue also partnered with a nearby parking lot with special rates for theatre goers. Their website is very informative! Outstanding addition to Chicago's theatre options!,Teatro Zinzanni,December 2019,50
Mother never told me about this! ,TravvelBug,"Think of Cirque du Soleil meets cabaret, meets Rocky horror picture show ( the audience participation portion) add an intimate gourmet dinner, sprinkle in some laughter, unexpected surprises, and wonderful performers and you get Zinzanni. Set in a beautiful tent, Zinzanni is a feast for the eyes and a sensory experience like no other in Chicago.

Visit on a week day,Bibitybobityboo,"I having been stopping by for the past several years. This year I went Thursday afternoon and it was just fine. The lines were extremely short if any at all.

Always fun!,justme54481,This event is truly one of the easiest recommendations.,Taste of Chicago,July 2017,50
Don't miss,RickfromPgh,"Not knowing what to expect we were almost overwhelmed by all the choices. If you aren't sure what to try look for the lines, almost a guarantee worth the five to ten minutes waiting. We asked the sous chef from the hotel for recommendations to try, we were not disappointed. Fries that are fried in beef and then duck fat are to die for as was the tequila lime taco. Churro with vanilla pudding inside was probably the best surprise taste, outstanding. Hoping to make it back next year",Taste of Chicago,July 2017,50
"Smaller than I expected, but still fun!",Supernova684,"First time at ""The Taste."" Brought my two little ones with me. $10 buys you 14 tickets. Each food item cost around 5 tickets for smaller portions to 10 tickets for larger portions. I'm a picky eater, but the food I tried was worth the experience! Take your own beverage/water if you plan to go next year. A 20oz soft drink was $5. Don't forget the umbrella too! It can get really hot.",Taste of Chicago,July 2017,40
Wasnt impressed,lynnc156,"It was a lot smaller than I expected for such a large city.  We got in for free but there was security that we had to go to, to get in.

More interactive than expected,Stlfam5,I would definitely try to go at an off peak time. Crowds would have taken away from our enjoyment. It's also a bit pricey. There were free lockers to store your stuff while visiting.,wndr museum,October 2019,40
Weird and Fun Place,Spa-Foodies,"This (regularly changing) interactive gallery is neat! You need to be in the mind of having fun and interacting with the exhibits. It's very cool for kids, but even for older adults like Mr & Mrs Spa Foodies. We found this exhibit on TripAdvisor (our Lyft driver never heard of it) and we're glad we went to see it. It takes about an hour - if you stop and play a bit - but it could be shorter or longer depending on your commitment. It's near the Greek & Italian neighborhoods, but would say not really walk-able unless you're familiar with the area. Try it; visitors and Chicagoan's alike!",wndr museum,November 2019,40

wndr museum,kskkd,The wndr museum seems like a good idea.  Immerse yourself in different art environments.  In reality it is a crowded instagram spot for teens and 20 somethings.  Way overpriced even for the few good things inside.  There were a couple of good tech pieces but also cheap cotton to look like clouds.  Save your money.  Take pictures by outside wall art.,wndr museum,November 2019,20

Chicago landmark -must see,O6378WFannag,Must see building for those interested in history of architecture. This building was completed in 1895 and it was designed by well known architects Holabird & Roche. The Marquette Bldg was one of the first steel frame skyscrapers and is considered one of the best examples of the Chicago School of architecture. Very nicely ornate inside. This building lobbies and indoor walking routes providing shortcuts through full city blocks are still open to public. Very helpful during very cold or very hot days in Chicago.

Crowded and expensive,BelikinBeer,"For two people, we spent $100 on tickets as you get 14 tickets for $10.  11 tickets for a can of Bud light, 14 tickets for a smaller can of Stella Artois.  A liter of smart water 11 tickets.  BJ's had great catfish and was very popular.  Good peach cobbler.  Many dishes just are not meant for mass production.  The Shrimp & veggie tempura was a grease fest.",Taste of Chicago,July 2017,30
Lots of food,KrystinaR29,My bf and I tried 15 different food items...15!  It was crowded but nothing too bad.  The lines went through quick and the ticket booths were not crowded at all.

One of Chicago's first steel frame skyscrapers,Taylor B,"Chicago is known for its steakhouses, hot dog stands and pizza parlors. it also is known for its architecture and skyscrapers. Frank Lloyd Wright worked here. So did Louis Sullivan and D.H. Burnham. One memorable structure, the Marquette Building, is considered an architectural masterpiece. Completed in 1895, at the northwest corner of Dearborn Street and Adams Street, it was designed by architects William Holabird and Martin Roche and was one of the early steel frame skyscrapers of its day. It also is considered one of the best examples of the Chicago School of Architecture and is noted for its then cutting edge frame and its ornate interior. The building is constructed around a central light court and features an ornate, two-story lobby. The ensemble of mosaics, sculptures and bronze of the entry and interior honors Father Jacques Marquette's 1674-75 expedition. He was the first European settler in Chicago. The mosaics are by Louis Comfort Tiffany and contain panels of lustered Tiffany glass, mother-of-pearl and semi-precious stones. In 2007, a free interactive audio visual exhibit was opened to the public on the first floor, detailing the history of the building and its contribution to Chicago architecture. The Marquette Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, listed as a Chicago Landmark in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976.",Marquette Building,May 2019,50
True Chicago architecture and much more,klhchicago,"The Marquette building is a great snap shot of Chicago's history with architecture. Walk into the lobby and get a brochure from the attendant or simply read the descriptions of Native Americans, French explorer Father Marquette,  and much more. There are bronze reliefs and  mosaics which are beautiful as well as much of the decoration of the lobby by famous architects William Holabird and Martin Roche. Walk into the back and there is architecture exhibits which explain more about the architecture of some past and present buildings in the city.

A very nice 250-seat venue in the lower level of the Chase Bank Building and just as much fun as we had hoped it would be.  The taping for the 1-hour show began promptly as scheduled and ended two hours later.  I had not realized that almost half of what is said during the show is cut and reduced to an hour for broadcast.  It was interesting to watch the ""extended"" version and to see how they finished by doing voice overs directed from the booth.  After the show, all of the cast made themselves available in the lobby for autographs, conversation and selfies. There are lots of restaurants in the immediate area.

Some had short.lines and some were long. There was Beer in several locations and a large tent for mixed cocktails. Im.not going to make a list of what we ate, but I will say we threw nothing out. We even treated our Service Animals to some new items. Parking was $20 at the Millennium Garage. We spent another $80 on drinks and food. We spent about 5 hours there. Buckingham Fountain was awesome. The only real issue was not having enough seating area for the thousands that attend each year. We had a Great Enjoyable Day!",Taste of Chicago,July 2019,50

We didn't have to leave our parking garage until 3:00 PM and had already checked out of the hotel, so walked to check out the Taste.  You by your tickets and basically decide what foods you want to taste.  Most items cost between 2 and 4 tickets.  I enjoyed many samplings but was very surprised that my favorite food came from a vendor truck!  It was amazing.  All in all, this was a fun activity and took up an afternoon.  Don't go expecting to eat a full meal for cheap though.  Remember, it is all about tasting things.  ",Taste of Chicago,July 2016,50

Chicago Summer Tradition-give it a try if in town in during the 2nd week of July,ImmerWandern,"The extremely annoying ""leftover ticket"" conundrum.

Bad food. Too expensive.,skibran,"Appears my original review was removed? OK,  bad food,  really tasteless and expensive. This fest used to be fun with good food,  they don't have the good long standing Chicago restaurants anymore that were at taste and cared about the quality of their food. Tiny portions for the taste samples that cannot possibly be representative of what these restaurants have to offer. They should be ashamed of what they are selling,  I would never go to any of the places we tried based on what we tasted. Not to mention the cooked roach in our beef sandwich, just telling the truth here. This is after all ""trip advisor"". Never again. They should end it. Taste of old is gone.",Taste of Chicago,July 2019,10
Disappointing,CarolinaTravelers2,"Although we had heard about Taste of Chicago and were glad to be in town for this outdoor festival, we were disappointed and would not recommend going on a hot, sunny day. Guests must stand in a long line to buy scrip since vendors do not accept cash or credit cards. Food vendors are arranged along the hot pavement; trees and grassy areas are fenced off behind the vendors. There is nowhere to sit and eat. Lines at some popular vendors are long. Prices vary, but even small samples are not cheap.",Taste of Chicago,July 2019,20
Nice walk but only in the morning or afternoon,Daniel A,"It was too hot for a stroll through this wonderful neighborhood. Although we did see some people jogging in the intense heat, WOW!

Nice Area,Farid P,"I recommend a walk along the Hyde Park (Down town) area. Do visit Cafe 53 for a quick snacks and coffee. They have an outside area to sit, otherwise take food to nearby Park.

Samples From All The Best,MerlynDalamar,"While visiting Chicago this past weekend we were lucky enough for this event to be going on.  We purchased a 6 sheets of tickets, $8.50 for 12.  We tasted a Mexican brew that was quite tasty.  We didn't care for the steak & chicken sandwhiches from Gino Steak Truck.  La Bomba pork Shish-Kabob was very flavorful.   We have to say however the pizza from Connies & the Chicago Dog from Gold Coast Dogs were our favorite.   I don't even like hot dogs!  The Decemberists were fun to watch.  Bummed we missed Billy Idol.  Over all a very fun event.  Even with protesters, the police were fully staffed and everyone was just happy to be out and about.  We would check it out again.

Taste of Chicago Festival,Gertrude G,"Lots of good food, go early when it's not as crowded. Lots of sunshine better wear a hat. We got a flyer that listed all the restaraunts/food trucks/pop up restaraunts to keep track of the ones we liked, and still didn't get to try half. We got smaller ""taste"" sizes to share.",Taste of Chicago,July 2016,40
NOM NOM NOM,Daniella R,If you are unsure of what to eat and you're in town when this fabulous buffet of choices is on please do your foodie self a favour and head to it. Entrance is free and they have this nifty ticket method to buy food so you're not juggling cash every time you want to try a bite of something. Most places will have a full dish or a taste version so you can go around tasting things until you're full or if you're like me just settle down with a massive plate of delicious funnel cake with ice cream and enjoy. ,Taste of Chicago,July 2016,50
excellent venue for music and dance,jkirbycunningham,"The Harris for me is the best theater in chicago. The sight lines are excellent as are the acoustics. I have been there on numerous occaions and now subscribe to their programs, as there are many unusual and different offering. The English Ballet Company rendering of Giselle was unforgettable.",Harris Theater,May 2019,50
Great view,edculp7,We used 1032 waveland ave. Had great view and food was great. The only thing is couldnt hear announcers very well (-speaker needs to be louder) and bugs flying around. Maybe put out bug stuff.,Wrigley View Rooftop,May 2019,50

No reserved seating.  Smokers have to go to street level as no smoking on the rooftop.",Wrigley View Rooftop,August 2019,50
Great times!,lag726,"We were at the rooftops on Saturday and had a blast!  The only complaint was the chicken was a bit over cooked.

Great times, great memories!",Wrigley View Rooftop,September 2019,50
not worth the price if you're in healthcare,Monica T,"If you're in healthcare you've seen everything in the historical display cases in your hospital, nursing, medical school. The Art Museum had more paintings and this museum does not have plaques for any of the art. Most of the descriptions are printed paper and the words are wearing off (need plaques or at least laminate the paper!) numbered items and corresponding descriptors are often no where near each other and there is no audio on the app for your phone. Definitely underwhelmed but if you don't know a thing about healthcare this may interest you.",International Museum of Surgical Science,September 2019,20
Interesting ,ChucknJen,The price of admission may be high for some.  My wife wanted to check it out as she works in the OR daily. It was quite interesting to see some of the primitive tools. ,International Museum of Surgical Science,October 2019,30
A look at the past in matters of surgical science,yorellana,"When planning our stay in Chicago, a friend recommended this small and distinct museum. They know that you must keep a nurse mind busy with practical, historical or medical information. This hit the spot. The collection exhibited, along with the current exhibits, remind us of how surgical practice has changed. There are galleries devoted to ophthalmology, dentistry, pathology, medical imagining and x-ray machinery, and an original late 19th or 20th century apothecary. It we moved quite leisurely in the afternoon, towards closing time, through the exhibit floors of this grand old mansion. The exhibit that I liked the most was on ancient approaches to healing in the context of today’s well being.",International Museum of Surgical Science,October 2019,40

Fun in the Sun,Richard B,"Taste of Chicago can be a bit pricey if you are going there expecting a bargain. While it can not be touted for discounted food, there is quite a number of foods I tried in a very short period of time. I certainly will be visiting several of these venues in the future. If great food at a reasonable price is a goal, there are many places to visit. However, if an energetic mix of people, interesting foods, beer, and a party atmosphere is your cup of tea, it may be the place to go. If crowds are an issue, you may wish to refrain.",Taste of Chicago,July 2016,40
OMG....,237stephaniem,"Chicago literally has the best food ever. Every single year I go to the Taste of Chicago and the food is to die for. There are sooo many different vendors. I look forward to Harold's chicken, O'briens corn on the cob and giordianos pizza, etc...they offer taste portions if u don't want to order a large portion. I love the concerts that they have plus they have healthy foods as well. They give away prizes and have helpful vendors there. The taste is normally every year around the July 4th holiday. It's a must try event. ",Taste of Chicago,July 2016,50
Long lines and high prices,Sarsprdoc,"Had to wait to buy tickets then wait on long lines. Food that I wanted to try, couldn't even get close. $25 for 1/2 hot dog, fries, few fried ravioli and undercooked wontons. Wouldn't go on a Saturday afternoon and not great family event.

"Quirky, niche, off the beaten path ",hrobinson1114,"This is definitely a small, niche museum, but it’s a reasonable entry fee, and you can see some really neat stuff.  I’m in the medical field, so it was maybe a little more relatable to me.  You can see skulls that have undergone lobotomies, Napoleon’s death mask, and ginormous gallstones.  There are multiple works of art depicting early surgical procedures.  There are also sculptures of surgical and healthcare pioneers as well as surgical tools.  This is not a fancy museum with tons of multi-media exhibits or bells and whistles.  It is unique and off the beaten path and is worth a look if you’re interested in the medial field, the bizarre or unusual, or just looking for something quirky to do one day.",International Museum of Surgical Science,November 2019,40

Good museum and reasonably priced ,aidan c,Good museum - you need about 2 hours to take in everything. I think the $17 entrance is good value particularly when compared to price of other museums in Chicago. This museum is probably for a niche market and you would probably want to have a general interest in medical / surgical history. It’s probably not for everyone but I found it really interesting.,International Museum of Surgical Science,March 2019,40

There's a wide variety of food, and it was fun trying different things!  The only bad thing really was getting full stomach and running out of room to try other things (for that reason, the smaller 3-5 ticket items are recommended if you really are going for variety.)  The tickets themselves are easily accessible and there was an all-around fun vibe, a great variety of people.  Highly recommended!",Taste of Chicago,July 2013,50
A great place to walk around outside and enjoy the view,Patrick J,"It always has a lot of tourists walking around. I enjoy watching the families exploring the area.

Interesting but little-known museum of medical science,Michael B,"We lived in Chicagoland for 8 years but were unaware of this museum just off Lake Shore Drive in the Lincoln Park area. It doesn't match Philadelphia's Mutter Museum or the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Silver Spring, MD near D.C.'s Walter Reed Medical Center, but it is worth a visit nonetheless. There are many large paintings of surgeries, a recreation of a 19th C pharmacy, a couple of ancient Egyptian engravings with hieroglyphs, an iron lung machine, a collection of gall stones and other concretions removed from organs, an exhibit on the history of nursing, a hall of statues of medicine's heroes, and lots of surgical instruments.

"Hot summer nights, cool blues and cold brews!",EverleighYours,"This was the first year that the festival was held in Millennium Park, and it was not without a few glitches. However, it is three days of some of the best music you'll hear for FREE so it gets a pass. At least there were restrooms, water, some shaded tents, and thousands of music lovers from all over the world. And no waiting in line to buy tickets to get a cold beer- cash accepted now. The Windy City Blues Society has great (and underrated) musicians, including the Blues Kids Foundation. It was in an area that lacked shade so I think that people missed out on some talented shows there. The food situation was the worst part; food trucks and some tents selling hot dogs. I'm confident that the city will look into it and make amends before next year. I would be conflicted about bringing my own food & drink as I want to keep this fantastic event free for all to enjoy! They had some contemporary musicians but I went for the oldies -Denise LaSalle, William Bell, Billy Branch. Henry Gray, in his 90's (accompanied by Bob Corritore on harmonica, & fellow desert dweller) was one of my favorite performances all weekend. Chicago is known for its blues and this is a great way to preserve and promote a rich and inspiring culture.",Chicago Blues Festival,June 2017,50

Wonderful free Blue Festival,TripPhotographer52,"We had never been but went this weekend. The weather was not as good as we wanted, as it rained a bunch. It is in the Millennium park and what a wonderful mix of people. I am not familiar with most of the names and bands but most of the ones I heard were good. There was the main menu with many people and seats and then grass for people to sit and four other stages with music most of the time we attended. My daughter lives in town and so we did not go as much as I would have liked but enjoyed the experience. Police were around to make sure that people behaved. I was told that many of the out of town bands also perform at the blues bars when not plying at the festival.

"Heartbreak Hotel enjoyable, but sightline issues",family4MI,"Enjoyed Heartbreak Hotel on a Friday evening with spouse and adult son. Make sure you stay until it’s really over. Last segment should not be missed. We sat in front of a lady that kept screeching out comments which forced us to move at intermission. For at least this production, all seats are not good and some should be sold with a warning of obstructed view. It’s a simple set, so with some tweaks, it could be improved for all. For Heartbreak Hotel, the best seats are in the middle and first few seats off aisle to left and right. The far left and far right seats have obstructed views of the stage. The screens playing on the stage to the right and left cannot be completely viewed. Recommend theater adjust and bring more forward for future shows. When the band rolls out each time from the right, it stays to right and it too is partially blocked. Also the far right and left are not on real aisles where you can exit as you are next to a wall. So depending on the shows use of the stage, not every seat is good in this theater. Leg room is fine and seats are comfortable. The blocked views and screeching guest compromised our visit, but the show itself is entertaining. ",Broadway Playhouse,July 2018,30

Who knew surgery could be so fun?,peterfan,"We saw this museum featured in the Travel Channel show ""Mystery at the Museum"".  As we had a six hour lay over taking the train from Michigan to New Orleans, this was the perfect filler for the time we had available.  It is better if one has some interest in medical information; my daughter and I enjoyed it very much, my husband not so much.  I could have spent another 20 minutes just in the genetics room!  It is best for families with older children; younger ones seemed to get bored easily, as the exhibits are mainly reading and looking, not interactive.  It is about a 15 minute taxi ride about $9; we found out afterwards that the #151 bus stops outside the door for a $2.25 dollar fare (but have to have extra change or a card).  I would go back myself.",International Museum of Surgical Science,March 2017,50
Interesting little oddity of a museum,Poodlegirl1968,"You'll have to do a lot of reading to get meaningful information at this museum. There are 4 floors of exhibitions. My favorites: a room with statues of historically important people from science & medicine (Ex.-Lister, Hipporates, Pasteur). The information presented about each person was interesting and concise and new to me. I also enjoyed the wound healing presentation. I enjoyed my trip here. Probably not a place I'll visit twice.",International Museum of Surgical Science,April 2017,40
Extremely disappointed ,goldmann,"This is not a museum. You pay 15 $ to see some artifacts that are absolutely not interesting for a surgeon. Almost no instruments, no surgical explanation.

A museum that has lost its way especially with families,GlobalKidsTravel,"First, this museum should be free for kids younger than 12 and if done right it could really be informative for children. The Science Museum is! If you are going to continue to make families pay and advertise having family programs there should be clear parental guidance warnings for the 4th floor and the more graphic sections of your museum. I am glad my son slept through it. In its present state, it is more appropriate for high school kids at a minimum. ",International Museum of Surgical Science,May 2017,20
Surprising find,Masako W,"Searched the internet for interesting things to do while visiting Chicago for the weekend. As my fiance and I are both in the medical field, we thought this looked like a fun little excursion.  We grabbed an Uber to Old Town and found ourselves at the steps of an enormous, gorgeous building right on the Lakeshore. Be forewarned, this is not the Smithsonian, but it has a lot of great stuff! You could tell the curators took care to present the items they were entrusted with in an organized way. From a 19th century pharmacy, to an iron lung, to an exhibit on optical wear - they really cover all the bases. There were a lot of historical artifacts (trephinated skulls, orthopedic devices), as well as a hefty amount of artwork both on the wall and in the form of huge statues.  Plan to do a lot of reading while here to understand the depth of the displays. I don't think I could recommend this place for small children due to the amount of reading and ""dry"" exhibits. Also, since it's a former, four-story private home, there's a fair amount of stairs to navigate and this may present a problem for strollers.

Room was on the 18th floor and withe the nasty toilet, mildewed shower, peeling wall paper and plaster coming off the ceiling, it has become a nasty worn out shadow of its once glorious self. Hampton Inns are run with more attention to detail than this place. A coffee pot sat in the hallway opposite the room the entire time we were there. Last thing: the shower/toilet was barely large enough to stand in and close the door.

Lots of large paintings depicting medical wards, surgical procedures, etc. adorn the walls and the art is quite good.  Some of the murals are huge and span an entire wall.  There is a little bit of everything and if you read everything you'd spend hours there.  As it was, we spent about 1.5 hours there and were captivated the whole time.  I found the eye instruments most interesting and the old anatomical models and anatomy drawings were fascinating.  The admission price is $15, and although I think it's a little high, it's still well worth a visit. (Tuesdays are free admission)",International Museum of Surgical Science,January 2017,50

The only museum dedicated to medical surgery in North America,Taylor B,"My wife and I didn't know what we were missing. For years, we have walked past the International Museum of Surgical Science at 1524 North Lake Shore Drive, which is located only two blocks from our condominium on the Gold Coast. We admired the lakeside mansion and vowed several times to visit the museum. But it took an article in the Chicago Sun-Times to make it happen. According to the full-page article, the museum is in the early planning stages to unveil an exhibit on sex reassignment surgery by the end of 2017. A study reveals 700,000 people in the United States identify as transgender and it is estimated that between 100 and 500 sex change procedures are performed each year in this country. Such an exhibit would be in keeping with the mission of the museum, which is operated by the International College of Surgeons. Established in 1954 by Dr. Max Thorek, the four-story mansion houses more than 7,000 medical artifacts. It is the only museum specifically dedicated to medical surgery in North America. It tells the story of the evolution of surgical practices from the early days of trepanation and bloodletting to more modern achievements in pain management, transplants and avoiding infections in surgery. Its displays include photographs, paintings, drawings, sculpture, medical equipment, skeletons, medical specimens and historic artifacts that interpret the pre-modern and modern healing practices of human civilization. From early practices to today's revolutionary techniques, the museum's collections and exhibits portray the mysteries, breakthroughs, failures and milestones that have shaped modern surgical science. Exhibits currently on view include: Wound Healing: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Techniques; A World Without Polio; Nursing: Care For A Changing World; Pain And Pain Management; Obstetrics And Gynecology; X-Rays; and Windows On The World: The Science Of Sight And The Ophthalmic Art. The building itself is a museum piece. It was built in 1917 by Howard Van Doren Shaw for Chicago socialite Eleanor Robinson Countiss Whitney, who died in 1931. Her old billiards room is the museum's library that contains more than 5,000 rare medical texts. The mansion was designed after Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI's Le Petit Trianon in Versailles. The International College of Surgeons acquired the building in 1950. In addition to displaying medical artifacts, the museum has, since 1998, hosted a number of contemporary art exhibitions in an effort to broaden its appeal to visitors. Its projected exhibit on sex assignment surgery is sure to attract more interest.",International Museum of Surgical Science,February 2017,50
Old fashioned style although not without interest,AnneBerkhamsted_UK,"Not sure what I was expecting - the museum is quite dated: a lot of written detail with a few interesting exhibits, paintings and statues of renowned historical figures and a bizarre top floor installation that had nothing to do with the rest of the museum. Worth an hour's visit maybe - although quite expensive at $15. Maybe of more interest if you work in the field. ",International Museum of Surgical Science,February 2017,30
Educational,Steffan B,This is a very educational experience. We learned a lot about the history of the medical field. There are plenty of things to see a read.,International Museum of Surgical Science,February 2017,50

Intimate Theater,RyanErin2014,"Our family of 6 went to this theater to see Stomp over the holidays and it was a great experience.  Small sized, intimate theater - I don't think there was one bad seat in the house.  They did have a bar for refreshments but I saw many people brought in water bottles or Starbucks.",Broadway Playhouse,December 2016,40
Cool Venue!,Brad S,"Took the girlfriend and saw ""Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus.""  The theater was nice and quaint.  Not really a bad seat in the place.  We sat on the right side and had a full view of the stage.  Only downfall is they had 2 bartenders working during intermission and the lines were very long... to the point not everyone could get a drink.  Will definitely see another performance at this venue.",Broadway Playhouse,February 2017,40
No bad seats...and cell phone alert!,Traderjoey,"Saw ""Men are from Mars...."" this past weekend. You really can't go wrong on seating or sound. Very good sight lines.The concession line is way too long, so that might have been my only complaint. They even validated our Water Tower parking. FYI...If you open your smart phone during the show, you might get a tap from the ushers....loved that!",Broadway Playhouse,February 2017,40
Wonderful stay,ericka88,"We were in town to see Hamilton so the hotel is conveniently located across the street. We were upgraded to the executive floor and had a private elevator and excellent accommodations. It is worth noting that the afternoon tea available in the lobby is worth every penny and our favorite part of the weekend. The breakfast and cocktail hours were ok but not anything above a normal hotel in my opinion. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend highly. And dont forget to get the world famous brownies, the chocolate covered strawberries sit atop the brownies as well! Well worth it.",Palmer House Hilton Historic Lobby,November 2018,50
Excellent for views of Chicago,farjada2016,"Great place to go. Went with load of family of all ages.

Not quite what I expected.,396diannas,"As a retired OR nurse I was looking forward to this museum. It was ok but not what I expected. There were not as many exhibits as I expected and many of them didn't have anything to do with surgery. There were a lot of ""posters"" with the displays so it was more reading than looking at objects. ",International Museum of Surgical Science,August 2016,30
Not heavy on display pieces,Phillyboy1234,"Well off the beaten path it encompasses four floors of a stately building, but lacks a high amount of display pieces. The vast majority of the museum is composed of posters which explain various aspects of medical history. While interesting, it is probably not worth the money that you pay to get in. Hopefully the money that the museum has collected will go towards acquiring more items for the museum. They may also consider reaching out to local medical schools and asking for their historical pieces.",International Museum of Surgical Science,September 2016,20

Great app you can download to your smartphone which prompts you to interesting facts.",International Museum of Surgical Science,October 2016,50
Beautiful old mansion,vdraus,"The building is an old mansion. The marble floors nice. The moldings are good. There are no period furnishings. It is strictly a medical museum, but employees can tell you some of the building's history.",International Museum of Surgical Science,October 2016,30
Expensive Performance,Florida-Traveler-US,The tickets were very expensive compared to the content of the show.  It was more of a show for kids and I wish that would have been more explicit in the write-up. The theater is really nice and all seats are good.  It was also very clean and well maintained.  I just wish I would have know the play would not be worth the price.,Broadway Playhouse,December 2015,30
Watch out for those opera boxes!,KatrinaOlson,"Took my girls to see Potted Potter! The show was fine, the theater was intimate, but I whacked my head on one of the side ""opera boxes"" and literally gave myself a concussion. I'm not kidding. It was dark and they're so low you have to duck to avoid them if you walk down the side aisles. This happened before the show so I had trouble enjoying the rest. I'm not a big Harry Potter fan; but my kids are so it was worth it. The next day I was so dizzy I took a tumble and had symptoms for 2 more weeks. They really need to put reflectors on those or something. Jeesh!",Broadway Playhouse,December 2015,40
Seen 5 children's shows here!,Kim N,"Love this place.  It is really intimate.  There is not a bad seat in the house.  I love the location... can easily shop, eat, or walk around downtown when the show is over.  Have a little place inside to buy snacks and drinks.  Have a souvenir shop (overpriced... but cute stuff).  We will continue to come her for shows... as long as our kids will hang out with us.",Broadway Playhouse,December 2015,50

Small theater so all seats are good,nurabbit,"We bought our tickets at hot tix and were a little concerned about being in the back section of the theater.

We would definitely go to this theater again!",Broadway Playhouse,May 2016,50

Grateful for Modern Medicine,Sonja H,"This place offers a unique view of how broken bones, missing limbs and chronic pain were treated before our time.  Also, the advent of cesarean births, the origins of anatomy, x-rays, ophthalmology and the pharmacy.  If you are the least bit curious in your body and health care, this is a treasure of a museum off the beaten path.",International Museum of Surgical Science,March 2016,40
Must see!!!,Daniele M,Of all the places I visited this was my fav. It is full of very interesting old medical instruments and somewhat morbid pictures. They even have a replica of an old apothecary. Cute stuff in the gift shop as well.,International Museum of Surgical Science,March 2016,50
A Museum of medicine and health care,michaelj108,"A museum of medicine rather than just surgery. I had expected cabinets of sharp instruments, and was pleasantly surprised. There were rooms devoted to the National Medical Association for black nurses and its long struggle for recognition. A simulated apothecary from the nineteenth Century was amusing.  A chronology of medicine in a statuary hall of immortals was informative.   ",International Museum of Surgical Science,March 2016,50
"Fascinating museum, but lacking in what makes a museum great - interaction!",ellegarreau,"The museum of surgical science is not trying to be a MSI or Field Museum, but it does lack a certain quality that would make it truly engaging, and that is a level of interactiveness.  Most of the museum was based on one's ability to stand and read.  The information was highly fascinating, but could have been a bit more memorable if there was a little more ways to engage patrons.  Unless you are in the medical field, I would not put this at the top of your list of tourist attractions; however, if you are a Chicagoan looking for something new to see and learn about, this museum warrants a try.",International Museum of Surgical Science,August 2015,30

The Original Brownie ,jawja-dawgs22,"If you like brownies, you should definitely try this place out. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the brownie was so yummy! The brownie is topped with a cherry ice cream that is so awesome! ",Palmer House Hilton Historic Lobby,June 2018,50
Sumptuous delight: a brownie,JohnSB3,"In the lobby bar area of this hotel I had quite simply the best brownie I have ever had. I am not a big fan of brownies: I find them way to sweet for my taste and I think that too often the chocolate is cloying. However at Palmer House I enjoyed a well balanced brownie which had lashings of dark chocolate and cocoa powder well mixed and beautifully baked served with a dob of ice cream on top. It was just delightful. I was there with a tour group, and the others raved about it too. Worth going for the brownie alone, but the hotel is itself an object of some splendour and dates back to the early days of the city. Even a wander around the foyer, lounge, and reception is worth it",Palmer House Hilton Historic Lobby,May 2018,40
Collapsing Grandeur,Rebecca L,"I was born and raised in Chicago, so I'm keenly aware and appreciative of the landmark status of this exceptional hotel. But that's the public part. My tiny room boasts wallpaper peeling off in sheets, damaged and noldy furniture, a closet that's so full of mildew it smells like a wet dog crawled in and died, and a lack of simple amenities like bedside tables on both sides of the bed. All four electric outlets in the lamp bases are so old and loose the literally cannot charge a device. The plug just swims in them (this problem was confirmed by a colleague in another room). In short, guest rooms are a good 25 years past their expiration date. Possibly the worst value for money I've experienced as a business traveler. In fairness, the hotel has a posted satisfaction guarantee. My colleague's room was instantly switched when she complained. I was so exhausted after a 20 hour transatlantic flight that I didn't have an ounce of strength to leave my crumbling and malodorous room after finally checking in. One. More. Night. I'll just pretend I'm in a backpacker's hostel in a third world country.",Palmer House Hilton Historic Lobby,June 2018,20
Beautiful Lobby,K I,This lobby brings back many memories as a child. A Christmas tradition for 4 generations staying a weekend around Christmas time.

Rudolph play worth the trip,Paul C,To celebrate my wife's birthday we purchased tickets to Rudolph the red nosed reindeer at the Broadway playhouse across from the entrance to Water tower place.  The play was surprisingly fun and the script was very similar to the original t.v. special.  If you have children this play is highly recommended and it is fun even for adults that enjoy this story.,Broadway Playhouse,December 2013,50

Good on a free day; I might not feel it's worth $15 admission.,0chicagotraveler1,"Three of the exhibits left something to be desired.  There was a room of exhibits provided by a Japanese surgical society.  On a micro level, the displays were interesting, but the room lacked focus.  The room provided by the Republic of China needs updating; displays cite statistics from 1998.  Two rooms were devoted to the AIDS crisis.  The display consisted of text painted on the wall.  The text doesn't need a museum for display, and the painting wasn't particularly interesting.  A lengthy quote was painted on the wall at the entrance to the display; the quote was dumb and shrill and I didn't bother with the rest of the exhibit.",International Museum of Surgical Science,December 2015,30

Fun with the dinosaurs,Allen21096,"This is a small and somewhat intimate theatre that is part of the Broadway in Chicago theatres.  In some respects, it kind of reminds me of a theatre in the round, though it isn't.  There aren't the same balconies or levels that are in the many other Chicago theatres, and in reality, this is a great theatre to take kids, especially if it is one of their first times at the theatre.  We saw Dinosaur Zoo and enjoyed it.  It seems like all of the kids (and the parents) had a great time, no matter how young or old.  The production was somewhat simple with a narrator and the dinosaurs were actually very lifelike, even though they were small to very large puppets.  The one thing about the production is that there was a lot of audience participation which did keep the kids involved.  Several kids were brought onstage and some of the puppeteers actually came down into the seating area with the dinosaur puppets.  Was great fun, for all!",Broadway Playhouse,March 2014,50
Fantastic Theater,bjp30549,"Was with friends walking down the street when we came upon this theater just accross the street from the John Hancock building.  They still had tickets for Buyer & Cellar for that night.  The price for front row seats was very reasonable so we got our seats for that night.  The theater was much smaller than I'd expected.  Very intimate.  As I looked around, I can honestly say that there wasn't one bad seat in the house.  It would have been very easy to enjoy any show from any seat in the place.  This cultural addition to our trip made my first trip to Chicago even more memorable.",Broadway Playhouse,May 2014,50
A wonderful time at the theatre,larryd6578,"Every seat in this house is great!  We saw the play ""Buyers & Cellars"" while we were downtown.  This play was very good.

Wow... and then wow,annzsam,"I peeked into this hotel during a visit to Chicago and the lobby drew me in. The old European style high mural ceiling was a fantastic sight. Picked up some random bar trivia while having a drink: this place invented the brownie, first to have lightbulbs, powered elevators, in room phones and is the longest running hotel in America. So awestruck to be sitting in rich history. Went down an internet rabbit hole about this place when I got home. Will be even more awesome next time I visit having much more knowledge and appreciation for it's history ",Palmer House Hilton Historic Lobby,October 2016,50
Wonderful museum in a beautiful building,Mikey_Velvet,I visited this museum while on a business trip to Chicago. I had already visited many of the art museums so the International Museum of Surgical Science was a refreshing change. Having no professional medical experience I found the exhibits quite interesting. I was fascinated to learn that the Romans were performing brain surgery! I don't think this is a good museum for children because there is so much information to read on the walls. The building is quite beautiful and I can't imagine that it was once someones home. This museum is worth a visit.,International Museum of Surgical Science,August 2015,40
"Unusual exhibits, most were interesting",MrFrump,"The layout was strange, lots of steps, but the building itself was interesting.  Some of the exhibits were a ""work in progress"" but overall it was a very educational, if macabre, experience.  I did think it was a bit expensive for the time spent and # of exhibits.",International Museum of Surgical Science,September 2015,40
Very interesting. ,mazzerole,I wish we had more time to read the exhibits. Definitely interesting. The architecture was amazing. And the paintings were just spectacular.

Interesting and studious but not too much so,Wendy119186363,"This museum is more or less at the top end of N Lake Shore Drive  before you get to the park. It is housed in an impressive building which itself deserves time to view. The museum is free on a Tuesday which is when we visited. That said, it was not overly busy. The exhibit starts with  good information which needs time to absorb so if you are a ""look and touch"" person it may not be your best place to start. I enjoyed the pharmacy which was brought to life with an audio. There are other exhibits around the 4 floors and gives you time to reflect, eg iron lung, dental implements, prosthetics. I love anything medical/surgical so I enjoyed it. Not sure whether it will be a ""suits all"" though - may be too serious. I believe more could be done to enhance the visitor experience  -I think much could be learned from the first operating theatre  museum above the church near London Bridge in London which is much smaller but much more evocative .",International Museum of Surgical Science,October 2015,40

Took my breath away,rushmore9915,"It is so worth taking a peek inside this historic hotel lobby.  Apparently they did a multi-million dollar renovation and it is like going back in time.  When you enter, you find yourself entranced by gold doors with peacocks sculpted into them.  Walk up the staircase and you find yourself in an amazingly high-ceilinged hotel lobby the way it would have looked 75 years ago with intricate plaster work that looks as though tapestries adorn the ceiling.  The light fixtures are ornate sculptures.  The room is magnificent.  And taking a peek inside the Empire Room (located up another short flight of stairs) is also a treat.  Apparently Frank Sinatra used to play here, before the days of stadiums.  The photographs do not do it justice.  One must experience it!!

A Must See,Gwendolyn K,"The lobby is absolutely beautiful, especially at Christmas time!  The ceiling is awe inspiring!  It’s magnificent to say the least. The famous Empire Room is there also.

Franciscan hospitality in heart of downtown Chicago,Galooba,We attended Sunday mass while staying at the Palmer House during the holiday season.  It is very convenient for visitors staying downtown as well as workers in the area.  The inside is quite beautiful and it is a peaceful oasis from the hustle and bustle.  Its location and accessibility makes it easy to tend to your spiritual needs in the big city.,St Peter's Church,December 2015,50

Beautiful church in downtown Chicago,dvkremk,We toured this church with the Architecture Foundation as part of their Sacred Spaces tour.  I had walked by this church many times but had never been inside. I hadn't realized it would be an art deco style. Very well done and a nice place for individuals to pray. ,St Peter's Church,July 2016,50
A wonderful retreat/respite in the middle of the loop,John S,"Proudly standing in the middle of the block on Madison Street between Clark and LaSalle, St. Peter's is a quiet spot in the hustle of commerce.  You can spend time in quiet reflection, attend Mass or, with a priest always on call, you can receive reconciliation.  The Franciscans have a special charism that is evidenced by the warm and inviting way that they greet each person who enters the church, regardless of station in life.  The morning Masses are a great way to start the day, and the weekend Mass schedule can fit with nearly any itinerary.  ",St Peter's Church,July 2016,50
Crucified Christ in the Loop,Rolf A,Along Madison Street just west of State Street is a large Crucifixion designed by Latvian sculptor Arvid Strauss and carved by J. Watts of Chicago in 1952/53. It graces the front of the Franciscan Order of St. Peter's. Inside are no stained glass windows but ample quiet and peace at the heart of the city.  It's a well worth stop to experience how a sacred place can sooth a city. ,St Peter's Church,August 2016,50

Best view,JerseyIndyFamily,"We have been to the Willis Tower but I have to say the 360 view at the Hancock Tower was far better. The lines on a Monday were almost non-existent.

Fab views if you like heights!,Lovelyrita2002,We didn’t book a meal we just went to the bar. We had a thirty minute wait but then suddenly we were on the 96th floor! I felt a bit wibbly and couldn’t really enjoy the views too much but had a couple of lethal cocktails to steady my nerves. I was ok high up in New York but I think that was due to being surrounded by other buildings as tall but as Chicago has less this high you really felt the isolated height! The views are amazing and the cocktail service excellent ,John Hancock Center,April 2019,40

Beautiful!,polkadotpilgrim,"The crucifix on the outside is just magnificent and it just draws you in.The Church is very beautiful but what really blew me away was that they have confessions 730 am -6pm m-f and for 4 hours on sat.What church in America is so dedicated to confession?Its almost like being in Rome again.I also heard a story that a man really needed to go to confession and a man appeared out of nowhere and told the man to go in this church and to go to this certain priest that was hearing confessions.Then he looked to thank the man and the man had disappeared.Later when he saw a picture of St.Louis Martin he said,that’s the man I saw!That alone is deserving of a visit to this church!Its highly recommended by St.Louis Martin",St Peter's Church,October 2017,50

Lots of photo opportunities,Indah2014,"John Hancock Center is basically a day activity.  There is so much to do and see in and around it that you can easily spend half a day exploring.  I love the architecture of the building itself and took tons of great photos of the building itself from all kinds of angles.  There are few restaurants on the ground level (Benihana, the cheesecake factory, Starbucks) so you can have lunch or dinner. Gift shops in the lower level have many trinkets for tourists to get.  The 360 deck at the top is really amazing and worth the ticket.  Up top the views are great and really gives you the feel of how nice Chicago is.  The bar on the top is a nice place to get a quick drink while you enjoy the views.  Skydeck offers a bit of a thrill as they have an activity where you drop forward on one of the windows.... nothing too exciting but something to do.  there is also live music sometimes to entertain everyone.  Overall great place to visit and spend 3-4 hours easily.  Tons to do in the area as well.",John Hancock Center,May 2019,40
Beautiful view without the crowds or admission,Ken C,"We went to the bar on the 96th floor.  If you go at off hours (morning and early afternoon) there isn't much of a line.  You have to order something, but why not have a drink and take in the beautiful view.  The cocktails were well crafted and the view was awesome.  The staff doesn't mind once you are seated if you wonder around to look in different directions.  ",John Hancock Center,July 2019,40
Go to the Signature Room,BillUsma74,The view from the 96th Floor is fantastic and no line.  It will cost you each a drink @$10 each but to get to the 98th floor you have a long line and it costs $33 per adult and $23 per kid.

Depends on the Show,Fontek,"We went to see ""Heartbreak Hotel"" (an Elvis retrospective) here.  The center seats afforded a great view and sound experience, but the entrances and exits to the auditorium were awkward for exiting (crowded).  The actual show we saw was sub-par. The Elvis actor was marginal, and some of the vocalists seemed to wrongly assume that loud singing = good singing.",Broadway Playhouse,July 2018,30

This trip, while not staying here, we stopped in to see the tree and have a drink at the bar.  I am in no way exaggerating when I say it was the slowest service at a bar I've ever had.  If they don't want to have a bar in the lobby, they should close it.  We waited over 30 minutes after our order was taken to receive our drinks.  Service was so poor it detracted from the enjoyment of the space.  Unfortunately, we'll skip this in the future.",Palmer House Hilton Historic Lobby,November 2019,40

A Small but Lovely Theater!,BuenaGirl,"Last night was the first play I've seen at the Broadway Playhouse as part of my Broadway in Chicago subscription, and this theater is lovely! I'm not a big fan of crowds and crowded spaces, which is why I include Suite Service with my theater package, but I can see why the Broadway Playhouse doesn't need Suite Service. The lobby was never crowded (before or after the show, or during intermission), the seats have a nice amount of legroom, and the lines moved quickly for the bar and restrooms during the intermission. Staff was efficient and friendly, everything is new and clean, and sight-lines were great for the show. My only complaint is that it's so far from the other Broadway in Chicago theaters, since I usually walk to the theater, and there aren't a huge amount of non-touristy dinner/drink options for before the show. But, all in all, a wonderful night at the theater!",Broadway Playhouse,October 2019,50

My First Baptism,HazelPeartree,"This ancient Hebrew has never been to a baptism, so when our brand new next door neighbors invited us to their son's first rite of passage in this sacred space, we were delighted. The place is breathtaking, and exotic in many ways. Following a major renovation, it has become one of Chicago's precious gems on the inside as well as the outside.  The bas-relief lacy friezes that frame the altar are timeless.  Adorned by spectacular stained glass imagery, the soaring space is filled with light, and all of the pastel-hued Celtic knotted wall decoration is at once exciting and yet subtly urges contemplation.  We went upstairs to get another perspective and were totally blown away by the auspicious beauty of this sacred space.  Curiously, there is no Christ on the cross at the front of the altar, but a kindly St. Peter holding a shamrock welcomes you. This striking edifice survived the Chicago fire and is the city's oldest surviving Catholic chrch.  A beautiful inner sanctum.",Old St. Patrick's Church,December 2018,50
Horrible customer service ,andrewleehl,"I visited the Nordstrom Chicago store earlier today and was actually looking for the promoter of one of the brands in the cosmetics department. I stood around the display shelf area hoping someone would care to assist me but was totally ignored by the few sales ladies who were around the area the whole time. Finally, I had to approach one of them and her attitude and answers to my questions were not very forthcoming, certainly cold at best. Sensing her condescending attitude, I decided to leave as I felt I was not really receiving much assistance from her. Her service attitude which could definitely be improved was an older lady who made me feel that it was beneath her to serve me. I strongly suggest that if she is so jaded and selective of whom she wants to serve, perhaps it is time for her to consider doing something else in another job instead of spoiling the shopping experience for Nordstrom’s customers. We have a choice of stores where we can spend our money and today’s experience at Nordstrom Chicago was certainly a horrible one!",Nordstrom,May 2019,10

I don't think you need to enjoy old architecture to appreciate the beauty of St. Pat's.  There was a wedding taking place when we went there.  Not sure if that made our visit lucky or unlucky.  We would have loved to walk around, but watching the wedding from the first floor, than walking up to the balcony was cool.  Old St. Pat's may be old, but it is a beauty.",Old St. Patrick's Church,April 2017,50
BEAUTIFUL A MUST SEE,Jimbilly,My wife and I enjoy visiting old and historical churches. Old St Patrick's has to be in the top 5 that we have ever visited. The church is listed on the National Historic Registry. It was one of the few buildings that was undamaged by the great Chicago fire. The church is very bright and the statuary and art work are magnificent. There is a large stained glass reproduction from the book of Kell's above the altar. The pews are like I have never seen before in a wave fashion not the straight across as we are accustomed to. We visited the choir loft and the church view is even more spectacular from there.  Walk across the street and visit the park with the statue of Grainee  a gift  from the city of Galway Ireland to sister city Chicago.,Old St. Patrick's Church,April 2017,50

The only store that had very stylist and just what I was looking for was Nordstrom on Michigan Ave. The address says Grand ave, but it's on Michigan ave at Grand. The service and selection is unbeatable. I bought four pairs. Highly recommend to all men looking for the best selection and service.

8pm mass,Kd N,"My husband and I are regulars at the 8pm mass time here. We love this mass because, old St Pat's is a very popular church with pretty crowded masses at other times of the day. This mass is a lot less crowded, which allows us to really focus on our worship. The music at this mass time and generally at OSP is awesome. The music enhances the mass, is beautiful and not over the top. All of the priests are good but the pastor, Fr. Tom is truly special. OSP also has a lot of events and outreach programs going on constantly which reflects this church's mission. In terms of logistics there is easy free parking just north of the church in a large lot while construct is happening in their old lot on the south east corner opposite the church. There is also some free street parking. This church is wheelchair accessible (elevator). Bathrooms are hard to get to, small, and few in number. This church is also almost always too cold for me. In the winter I keep my down coat on throughout mass and in the summer I have to bring a cardigan. Definitely check out this gorgeous church!",Old St. Patrick's Church,July 2016,50
Not the store service it used to have,kimaB3954PV,"Unfortunately, this review pertains to a lot of retail stores that used to be high end and amazing in terms of goods offered and service. I went to the lingerie department and the clerk did a fine job. Not an amazing job but okay. Certainly better service than you would get at most retail stores - which is none. The shoe department, however, was a big disappointment. Nordstrom's was originally just a shoe store. That's how they started out and it's how their reputation grew as a fantastic store. Yesterday I went to the shoe department and out of 10 shoes selected, they only had 3 pairs in my size. I'm a size 11 - larger than average but nowhere near as unusual as 20 or 30 years ago. The clerk kept insisting that they could order the shoes in my size. Well, if I wanted to order the shoes, I would have stayed in the comfort of my own home and clicked on a computer. Also, as he started to realize that I wasn't going to purchase any of the 3 pairs of shoes offered, his interest in assisting further was noticeably diminished. I would also add that the clerk was a man. Now this may be a sexist remark but in my experience, women are so much more detail oriented, particularly when it comes to shoes. Therefore, my shopping experience might have been different had a woman waited on me.",Nordstrom,April 2017,30
Shopping on a budget,Julie T,Ended up at Nordstrom for some jeans and found some great deals on clothes.  Tons of great selection and deals.  Usually don't go pass the shoe department but next year will be my first stop. ,Nordstrom,June 2017,50

The gates to the courtyard where there is elevator access were locked when we visited. There are stairs to enter the church, but not many, maybe 10 and handrails are available. The inside of the church was beautiful and air conditioned. There are bathrooms downstairs. The balcony was open for a different view of the church. Priest and employee didn't seem to mind that we weren't there for the mass, only to look around. It is a historic location-having survived the Great Chicago Fire, but it is only a church.

A convenient way to negotiate Chicago,Taylor B,"If you are a suburbanite or city dweller who works or shops in the Loop, you surely have become acquainted with the Chicago Pedway. If you are a tourist, you probably haven't. But you should. The Chicago Pedway is a network of tunnels, ground-level concourses and bridges connecting skyscrapers, retail stores, hotels and train stations throughout the downtown business district. It covers a length of more than 40 downtown blocks and allows easy access to shops, restaurants and public art and offers a cover for pedestrians during inclement weather. Most connections to the Pedway are commercial or government building, including hotels such as the Hyatt Regency, Swissotel and Fairmont. Popular entry ways can be found at Macy's department store, the James R. Thompson Center, Illinois Center, Grant Park's underground parking garages, Richard J. Daley Center, City Hall/County Building, Aqua, Chase Tower, Chicago Cultural Center, Millennium Park, Columbus Plaza, Leo Burnett Building and Aon Center. The oldest portions of the Pedway are the corridors between State and Dearborn Streets, linking Chicago Transit Authority's Red Line and Blue Line stations at Washington and Lake Streets and at Jackson Street. Construction of the Pedway began in 1951 and has continued ever since, with expansions in 1968 and 1973. Perhaps the system is most visible in the basement of Macy's, the site of the candy department and food court, where 22 American-made stained glass windows are on display. On rainy days it is worth the time to stroll along the Pedway and observe the shops and people and life in the underground world.",Chicago Pedway,April 2016,50

A Favorite Place for A Church Service!,Tell13,Beautiful and inspirational setting / brightly decorated Celtic themed architecture / very welcoming community and church service.  Music is also upbeat and integrated nicely into the service.  Very enjoyable church experience.,Old St. Patrick's Church,June 2013,50
Beautiful service,MaggieMae1,"I attended a Sunday mass in July that was led by Father Hurley.  Wow, it was amazing.  The church itself is embellished with beautiful Celtic scrollwork.  The choir included a piccolo and clarinet which made the music sound like Irish folk music.  Father Hurley was entertaining and thought provoking.  I wish I lived closer to Old St. Pat's, I would definitely attend regularly.",Old St. Patrick's Church,July 2013,50
A great tradition of welcome,Skip1951,"This is a friendly parish that uses great music, ambience, intelligent and relatable homilies and enthusiastic lay people to make everyone feel welcome. We travel 25 miles each way to attend because we can rely on all of those ingredients to make our visit to the church all that we hope for.  If you want an ordinary mass where people shuffle in and recite the same words, sing the same songs and don't greet each other, there are plenty of other options to consider.  No place that is made up of human beings is perfect but everyone with an open heart is welcome at O.S.P.",Old St. Patrick's Church,August 2013,50
Beautiful service ,Joshua R,I love all the Saint statues they have in this church and it was beautiful. The mass was very solemn. Great homily. But they don't sing at the 7:00 am mass so if you want music you have to go to another mass. ,Old St. Patrick's Church,August 2013,40

Horrible location ,dr_reagan,"When my wife and I are out of town, we try to hit the local breweries. We were told by some friends to go to the Chicago Lagunitas location. We took and Uber and were very surprised at the neighborhood that they chose to place this Brewery. There parking lot is surrounded by a tall chain link fence for good reason. Our Uber driver very explicitly told us NOT to walk anywhere around the neighborhood. We heeded that advice and took and Uber out. Brewery itself is ok. We had just came from NewGlarus two days prior, so our expectations may have been over inflated.",Lagunitas Brewing Company,July 2017,30
Cool place,Shrutit94,Visited this brewery last weekend and it is pretty cool. Liked the wall painting and the visibility to all the brewing tanks etc. beer was ok and swag shop is good.

Beaches in Chicago..who knew!!,Renee B,"In July, we hopped off one of the double decker bus tours in Chicago and went to the Oak Street Beach.  I'd always wondered what the people of Chicago did for water activities.  This beautiful beach on the shores of Lake Michigan is a Prime location near the downtown area.  There are plenty of activities, to name a few: jet skiing, volleyball, football, biking and of course there are nearby shops.  This big sky beach was pretty crowded considering it was well in the 80's. Great outdoor activity for the family, or alone.",Oak Street Beach,July 2017,50
Wonderful Tour of the House,Randy R,"My first suggestion is to find a place to park on Michigan Ave. and walk a couple blocks to the Museum grounds, as parking is a little hard to find up close.  Gwen was our greeter at the reception area and she was very nice.  Allan was our docent and he had such a passion for the Glessner House it was an awesome tour.  He new what he was describing and not just reading a script.

At 40 years old, I was on the older side of the crowd for sure but certainly not the only one there in my 40s. From the psychedelic walk through the tunnel to the huge room where you eat/drink, it really was unlike any place I've ever been. It was loud (not my thing) and a lot of beer options (I'm a wine girl) but I'm glad I can say I've been there if for no other reason than it sounds cool.  Food was good - I had the flatbread.

Good Beer,Elena V,A group of 12 of us went to Lagunitas Brewing Co. Most of us had not been there. The place is pretty big and the decor is pretty cool. I was surprised to see kids at this brewery. They had an area where they had a magic show for the kids. They also offered a free tour of the brewery. The food was pretty good and so was the service. The selection of beer was pretty big and they gave free tasters. While we were there they also had a performer singing the blues.,Lagunitas Brewing Company,February 2017,40

Designed by H.H. Richardson, whose picture remains prominently displayed in the reception area at the insistence of the original owners’ requirement in the deed. The house was being filmed for a PBS special on 10 signicant homes in the US. Owned by John and Frances Glessner who lived there with their two children, it has 17 bedrooms, a separate room for homeschooling the two children, a huge library and impressive music room, “modern” (for the times) kitchen with an attached ice storage room, several rooms for “the help” and more. Mrs. Glessner wrote a journal describing every meal served.

Wednesday afternoon,lily3047,"Lagunitas Brewing is by far one of the coolest places I've been too! The second you walk in the door you immediately get the vibe they give off, cool, calm, relaxed and laid back. You walk though a long hallway while listening to Pure Imagination from Willy Wonka and it really sets the tone for the whole experience. From the door man to the tour guides, taproom employees, down the the gift shop workers, they were all friendly and welcoming. The tour is so fun! The room you start in is a mix of video games, couches, and board games. They give you a little run down on each beer you try and a fun story to go with. The tour itself was very entertaining and informative. We had a quick lunch before leaving and enjoyed everything we got! The mussels we very unique and flavorful. The chef knows what he is doing and does it right! Wish we had more time to enjoy but we were traveling though. The employees really made us feel welcomed.

We sat at one of the high tables before the main entrance to the tap room. Our waitress greeted us within 5 minutes of our arrival. I ordered the IPA, my friends are not beer drinkers, so they just got soda. She came back right away with their sodas, but told me the tap was very busy and it would be a few minutes for my beer. 10 minutes later and I got it. Then we ordered our food. The food is really good, and priced right. Our waitress was hard to track down when we were done...but in fairness, it was Riot Fest weekend and it was very busy. She was very polite too. I wish we had more time to go on the tour, so I would like to go back for that. The shop has lots and lots of great merchandise too.",Lagunitas Brewing Company,September 2016,40

great brewery that you would never know was there from the street,litlflogr,We went to Revolution Brewery to meet up with a group - wouldn't have had any idea this place was here from the street - it's a nice big open space inside and they serve only the beer that Revolution brews (so if you are looking for wine or a mixed drink go elsewhere) - the beer was good and the space was nice. We didn't do the tour - just hung out and had drinks - but you can look back at the brewery area - looked pretty impressive.,Revolution Brewing - Brewery & Taproom,October 2014,40

Call Ahead!,Tradry,"We had planned to see the Glessner/Clarke House on a Saturday afternoon.  We've been on lots of these types of things, and had even been to this property many years ago.  When we arrived an hour before the scheduled time we were told very brusquely that the tour was full but that we were welcome to sit and wait to see if any one was a no show.  We walked to the lobby and when we asked if there might be space on the tour we got a very harsh ""Absolutely NOT!""  It was really very unpleasant.  I don't know if it was an off day or new guides or what was going on, but it was really unnecessarily rude/abrupt.   The situation could have been handled so much better with just a ""I'm sorry, on Saturdays you really need to call ahead.""  Left a bad taste.",Glessner House Museum,May 2014,20

Great beer and the tour was both informative and funny.  We stayed after in the big taproom area and drank some of the 10-15 beers they had on tap.  Everyone had an awesome time and all said that they would come back again.  There is no food here, but you can bring your own in.

Due to a very tumultuous cab ride, I didn't try any of the beer, but I did try the bacon popcorn. It's orgasmic. If you are anywhere near this place, and enjoy popcorn, bacon, and parmesan cheese, you need to go here. Seriously. Also the beer cheese soup was pretty fantastic too. My friend said the beer is good, and the atmosphere was great too. But seriously, if they served this popcorn in a box with lukewarm tap water, I would still recommend this place.",Revolution Brewing - Brewery & Taproom,November 2013,50

From steel to beer...,chi_dave,"In Chicago, there can't be a better place to visit for beer lovers than the Lagunitas brewery (well, unless it is one of the other breweries or brewpubs in the area). Lagunitas takes up one of the old Ryerson Steel buildings, leasing it from the Cinespace studios. We attended a 1pm Friday tour, which (as of this writing) is the only Friday tour that offers a free tasting (all tours Monday through Thursday offer tastings, none of the weekend tours do). These tastings take place before the tour itself, in their ""adult day care"" room...club chairs, bar stools, couches, a giant Jenga game, and a few arcade games are in this room. We had five samples the day we visited; our guide gave a little background on each beer. After the sampling, we headed up three flights of stairs to a catwalk surrounding the tap room. We made three or four stops along the catwalk, with accompanying narration. The tour itself was about 45 minutes long. We of course visited the tap room, and continued our sampling. Everyone we met was enthusiastic, our guide was very entertaining, and we learned a bit about the company and its future plans.",Lagunitas Brewing Company,October 2015,50
Great beer big place,Beader37,"Having visited the brewery in California, which is laid back I was a bit disappointed in the new Chicago location.  It's very large. Share tables , bench style.  Food is average. The plus is the beer is amazing.   You can see the facility from the restaurant.  Live music is also frequent.  Long wait for a weekend table where you need to find a spot in your own (weird system) but, again the beer is great",Lagunitas Brewing Company,February 2016,30
What a unique experience!,Nicole C,"From the trippy walk down the halls into the brewery to the awesome walkways above the brewery, this was a very cool visit. The tap room was cool but the bar and eating lounge upstairs is where it's at. From the bar, there is access to the above-the-brewery walkways where you have the option to walk along on your own or walk along with a guided brewery tour. We had our eleven-month-old son with us and everywhere, including the walkways, was very stroller-friendly! The food was quite tasty- I loved the giant soft pretzel with mustard. And although I was pregnant and unable to drink when we went, my husband was able to enjoy the brews- he enjoyed quite the variety when he and our friends ordered a flight! Very cool place!!",Lagunitas Brewing Company,March 2015,50

I was even compelled to write management and compliment the various associates who went out of their way to assist me.  Their fine jewelry includes collections from John Hardy and David Yurman, and their fashion jewelry is usually pretty diverse - something for most tastes.

Add to that an Armani Xchange, Kiehl's, and the Loft and you've just about hit all of the great spots in one convenient, and very warm location. The Mezza Grill, and Vosges Haut-Chocolate are a must-stop. There's a Lucky Brand, Stuart Weitzman, Sunglass Hut, and a Forever XXI. What more could you ask for in a shopping destination?

Fun but Crowded,crmhous312,"Oak Street Beach is very clean and well-maintained. There are always fun things going on here and it is great for the entire family.

I was in the shoe department which was Crazy..walked towards the handbag section ( high end Yves St. laurant etc...) and behind the counter was a gentleman on his cell phone..looking at something. I know smart phones are handy...but call me old school...you are at work....stay off the phone!! There was no one with him so he wasn't looking something up for a customer. The other associate was complaining....get over it.it is your job you choose to do.

I suggest an uber or taxi for drop off and pickup along bringing your own food and chairs. You can rent chairs and there's a great restaurant on site but you will have to succumb to Downtown Chicago prices for food and drink. The back has plenty of room to party, play and just lounge. It's worth a days visits versus just a few hours. ",Oak Street Beach,August 2016,40

Simmerling's gallery opens in Glessner House,Taylor B,"Jack Simmerling and I grew up in Blue Island, a south suburb of Chicago. In fact, we lived on the same block. Jack lived at 120th and Greenwood. I lived at 121st and Greenwood. He was five years older so I didn't know him very well. But I knew he was an aspiring artist. He had a studio in his back yard next to the garage. When I was in high school, he was attending the University of Notre Dame. In 1994, I saw a note in a local newspaper that he was having a signing for a new book at a location in Blue Island. As it turned out, he and a friend had discovered a chest of old Civil War letters. They had written a book about them and Jack had painted the illustrations. The first thing I noticed was the illustration on the front of the book, a picture of the ruins of Windsor plantation near Port Gibson, Mississippi, an historic site that my wife and I had visited on more than one occasion. ""Where is that picture?"" I asked Jack. ""In an auction house on the south side of Chicago. We're selling the letters and some pictures, including that one,"" he said. ""Get me that picture and I'll buy it,"" I said. Two days later, one of his daughters drove to our condominium in Chicago with the picture and I signed a check on the top of her car. It has hung in our library ever since. It is a magnificent watercolor. True story. So imagine our delight when we read Chicago Tribune writer Rick Kogan's recent story about the official opening of the Jack Simmerling Gallery of Prairie Avenue History in the Glessner House on South Prairie Avenue, a house that he had painted several times in his long (six decades) and distinguished career. Glessner House, that fortress-like structure in the heart of historic Prairie Avenue District, was built in 1886 by industrialist John Glessner, who later founded International Harvester. In the late 1880s, after the Chicago Fire of 1871, Prairie Avenue became home to many of Chicago's elite. It was the Gold Coast of its time. Glessner, Marshall Field, George Pullman, Philip Armour and other millionaires built mansions between 16th and 22nd streets. Today, only the houses of Glessner and contractor Henry Clarke, the oldest structure in the city dating to 1836, are open for tours via the Glessner House Museum. Simmerling's 300-square-foot gallery on the second floor contains paintings, watercolors, tiles, wood panels, terra cotta friezes, drawings, prints, photographs, newspaper clippings, even a doorknob and a mantelpiece. But it is only a fraction of the treasures that Simmerling accumulated and bequeathed to the museum. It is only a temporary space. The plan is to create a 1,200-square foot permanent gallery above the coach house. Simmerling, who died in 2013, is an original, a local product who loved Chicago and loved to paint everything that made Chicago what it is, one of the world's great cities. For years, we purchased hand-painted calenders that he produced annually filled with Chicago landscapes or buildings or historic sites. People who may not be acquainted with Simmerling's work should take time to visit his gallery at Glessner House or his Heritage Gallery at 1907 West 103rd Street in the Beverly neighborhood, where he worked for nearly 30 years.",Glessner House Museum,December 2014,50

This beach is not far from John Hancock building. Followed our smart phone map to the beach. Nice walking path took us there in 10 minutes. The stretch of white sand was much wider and cleaner than expected and for a warm summer day, it was not packed with wall to wall people. Lots of families on the beach. A few swimmers in the water.

They also have cash and carry beer and the usual offering of t shirts, pint glasses and trinkets. The tour lasted about 45 minutes.  The guide was very informative.  If you are into craft beer this is definitely worth the stop. Even if there are people in your party that are not into beer, I think they would find the tour interesting.

My favorite house museum; a must-see,ChicagOPeteChicago,"Although a bit south of downtown (accessible by bus routes or car), this house museum is definitely worth a detour. This is Chicago's only survivor work by the famed architect, H.H. Richardson, and the building has been meticulously restored--including original family furniture and wall decorations--to its late-19th century and early-20th century appearance. Architects from all over the globe come to gaze at the exterior, which was hugely influential. But don't miss the chance for a guided tour of the interior, including recently restored servants wing and coach house.

You step out of the l train on washington and then transfer to state street underground where you can catch multiple buses and the red line. The pedway extends much longer and is ver convenient especially during the summer.,Chicago Pedway,June 2013,30
Good tour,benton1220,Margaret gives a very energetic tour of the pedway which is a walk way under several building in Chicago. The tour is not very long but is is very informative. The Macy's building is beautiful and so is the Chicago Cultural Center. A good tour with an interesting tour guide!,Chicago Pedway,June 2014,40
More talk than walk,meaderanch,"I have been on one part of the pedway before and was hoping to walk a good portion of the sections I didn't know about. When we finally found Margaret in the mall (which, by the way, did not have the street address we were looking for), we found her very warm, friendly and knowledgeable. She spent a great deal of time at the beginning showing us the map, logo and history of the pedway. It was all very interesting but could have been condensed into a 5-min talk so we could have covered more of the pedway. We spent at least a half hour in the Chicago Cultural Center (which I have been to many times before) when I would have preferred to walk other portions of the pedway. So, if you really want to see as much of the pedway as possible, ask Margaret if she could tailor her tour to include more walking, less talking.",Chicago Pedway,August 2014,30

Truly classic Chicago architecture,Toddb62,My wife and I were heading to the lake from Union Station when I pointed this building out to my wife. This was definitely photo worthy for her.

Then you can walk through the elevator lobby to the Helmut Jahn designed addition that was built in 1980.  Downstairs in the 1930 building you can view the old vault.  The trading floors are now permanently closed to the public - due to the transition to electronic trading.  Many are currently being dismantled.

Total waste,ozzie11_11,We took the Pedway Tour  with Eddie as our tour guide. He was just awful and we spent most of our time above ground and ended at the Cultural Center. We only were down below ground level for a few minutes. We spent at least 20 minutes in Macy's looking at their ceilings. Not what we thought it was going to be. There were 12 on our tour and several left before it was finished because it was so bad. Maybe another guide would have made it better. It was the worst tour I've ever taken and a total waste of my money. There are so many tunnels we could have gone into but he didn't even bother. Skip this one. ,Chicago Pedway,July 2016,10

Not to well marked and very confusing....,O6378WFannag,"Well these maps are not too helpful. Confusing. It is hard to find the entrances to padways and it is very easy to get lost inside these underground passages....sometimes I felt very unsafe there, by myself. So in the summer I do not recommend them. Also some of the padways might be loced on the weekends (like those by the AON buiding) and there is no worning about that anywhere...you just have to know it to not get stuck..... It seams like there are a very good idea for the winter or rain but don't think they will save you time....they are usually not a shortcut .....",Chicago Pedway,October 2016,30
"Not exactly an ""attraction"" per se, but pretty cool if you like basements and exploring.",KmomChicago,"I don't know that I would take a paid ""tour"" of the Pedway, but on our last visit to the city we stayed at the Hyatt Regency by the river, and its lower levels lead into a Pedway section that we had fun exploring for a little while. It's basically a network of basements connected by short access corridors between the buildings. In a city where real estate is expensive by any measure, a fair amount of retail space has been created in these basements. They are there primarily to service the weekday business crowd, however, so if you are a tourist on the weekend, most of the shops and eateries will be closed.  If you have some time, and you don't mind the risk of getting lost, it's fun to wander around for a while.  You can find maps of the Pedway online and enter various sections through different buildings. It is not a complete network and you have to go above ground at some points if you are trying to visit the whole thing.",Chicago Pedway,February 2017,40

average,ELKW,"I went there in Chicago open house event, but the instruction for the entry is very unclear, you are difficult to find where is the entry point, the exit door has security to stand by, restricting people to enter from the exit door, even he points to you where is the entry door, but you are hard to find it, as there is no clear instruction, only a small paper near the door, but as you walk along the street, you won't notice such small paper, I think they should paper a bigger sign or have someone to stand at the entry point to give people a clear direction. when you go inside, you need to wait before you can enter the house, and it's a compulsory guided tour, that's there is a guide in each points, you need to listen to what they said before you go to another points, for me, as I am hurry and want to see many attractions during the open house event, so I really don't want to spend so much time here to listen each guide to talk about each room.

Could have been better,kevinsmithd56,"Maybe we're getting too old, but the experience we had here was just not great. The tasting was actually well done in a very comfortable lounge and large ours, but the tour itself seemed more focused on talking about experiences with weed rather than the company or the brewing process.

I can not say enough about the staff (they were all friendly, talkative, and seemed to love their jobs).  The price was on par with other breweries.  We really enjoyed the walkways upon entering.

Nearly five miles of underground pedestrian walkway,Taylor B,"The Chicago Pedway is a network of pedestrian tunnels, ground-level concourses and bridges connecting skyscrapers, retail stores, hotels and train stations throughout the central business district of Chicago. With a length of nearly five miles and more than 40 downtown blocks, it connects 50 buildings and contains shops, restaurants and works of public art. It is an answer to vicious winter weather and an easy link between train stations. The oldest sections are located between State and Dearborn Streets and date to before World War II. The rest of the network was begun in the 1950s and expanded in the 1960s and 1970s. By Macy's, the old Marshall Field's, check out the beautiful display of 22 stained glass panels, a holdover from the defunct Smith Museum of Stained Glass. Most connections to the pedway are commercial or government buildings, including hotels such as the Fairmont, Hyatt Regency, Renaissance Chicago Downtown Hotel and Swissotel. Columbus Plaza, The Heritage at Millennium Park, the Park Millennium, 200 North Dearborn Apartments and Aqua are the only residential buildings connected to the pedway. Tens of thousands of locals and travelers utilize the pedway each day. The longest continuous section of the underground pedway allows one to travel west to east from 120 North La Salle Street to the Millennium Park Bike Station with various points radiating north and south. A smaller branch connects 200 North Michigan at the westernmost point, east to the Swisshotel. Nearly every civically significant building in the Loop is connected by a section of the pedway, including the Aon Center, Chicago Cultural Center, Block 37, Daley Center, Dirksen Federal Building, Cook County Administration Building and James R. Thompson Center. Mbar, located within Millennium Station, where close to 20,000 people board Metra and South Shore Line trains daily, is the only bar along the pedway, providing commuters with drinks and snacks. On a cold and snowy day, the Chicago Pedway is a warm and convenient way to go from one side of downtown Chicago to another. And on a hot and sunny day, it's a cool and convenient way to make the same trip.",Chicago Pedway,November 2018,50

"A meeting of water, sand and a lot of concrete",Taylor B,"Can you think of any other city this side of Rio de Janiero where a popular swimming vista washes up against the concrete of the city's busiest thoroughfare? Think Chicago and Oak Street Beach. Located at 1000 North Lake Shore Drive, where Lake Shore Drive intersects with North Michigan Avenue aka Magnificent Mile and curves around the Streeterville neighborhood and the beachfront on its way to Navy Pier and Grant Park, Oak Street Beach rests on the shore of Lake Michigan. It was formed years ago by sand and silt washing up against the northern side of Streeterville, which was founded by George Streeter in 1886. Through the 1960s, the sand covered more than twice the area it does now and the water was as much as three feet higher than its current level. Gradually, the beach became a popular destination for residents and tourists as a summer social spot near downtown. Today, with a concrete running and biking path from Oak Street Beach to North Avenue Beach and beyond and with the addition of Oak Street Beachstro Restaurant, the area is more popular than ever. The beach also fronts a park and gazebo that is good for relaxing and people watching. If you're hungry, and you brought along a spare set of clothes, you can take a dip in the water in the afternoon and have dinner at the city's top-rated restaurant, Spaggia, at night. It overlooks Oak Street Beach at the corner of Oak Street and North Michigan Avenue. But they don't accept folks in swimming attire.",Oak Street Beach,September 2018,50

Must do for beer lovers,MsTravelKC,"We stopped in at Lagunitas for lunch while in Chicago and were blown away.  This place is a blast!  The food was good and beer was excellent.  They have an awesome catwalk over the warehouse that you can walk around on and see the bottling, packaging, etc at work.  They also have games and an well stocked gift shop.  If you are a craft beer lover you are missing out if you don't stop by Lagunitas Chicago.  I don't know what to expect since this isn't their primary location, but was blown away.

We did the Brewery tour first and then headed off to their taproom restaurant for dinner. We were disappointed not to make the 6 pm tour and were concerned that we might be too late for the 7 pm because the tours are limited in size. Our tour guide was one of the bar tenders who had served us sampler flights prior to the tour. The group was small and we had a very interesting tour with our well informed, passionate tour guide. We were provided a nice can of wheat beer to give tasty insight to our tour. Pictures were allowed throughout and the Revolution themed decorations and banners spiced up the views.

THe pedway sights are really not on the pedway,lchambliss,"Due to heavy rains during our trip, we took the pedway to keep out of the weather. The pedway is a little bit confusing as to the directions one should take.  The route markers are also very small compared to the giant spaces of entrance points along the way. The pedway makes sense if you're a Chicago resident and you've taken a metro train to your work or to an area with which you are familiar.  Like, maybe you work in the Daly Plaza so you know exactly which train to take and you know the pedway path to get from the train to work. But for the uninitiated, it was a bit confusing.  An ironic thing is that the picture posted in this ""suggestion"" from Trip Adviser, that is, the Tiffany ceiling in Macy's, is not on the pedway, but in Macy's.  If you want to say pedway includes Macy's, ok, the pedway does run through it, but that is just coincidental.  Also, if you do take the pedway, be sure to see the City/County Hall lobby. Lots of brass and tile, very pretty.  And also be sure to visit the Target on State, about three blocks down from Macy's. Incredible ironwork around and inside the Target.  ",Chicago Pedway,April 2019,30
Way to stay dry,joe-chicago-23,"The Macy's store on State Street is part of the attraction, with it's stained glass museum. ",Chicago Pedway,August 2019,40
Could be more continuous,AlexB10499,"A major plus in a city that has winters as harsh as Chicago. My introduction to the Pedway came on a day with torrential rains; I entered it from inside the Chicago Cultural Center, and was able to travel down a couple city blocks before ultimately having to face the rain. The Pedway isn’t just tunnels – there are also skybridge portions (I never had any occasion to take the skybridges). It’s definitely better to have this network than not, but my one criticism is that it isn’t as continuous as you might expect. For much of the Pedway, you can only walk a few blocks before you have to go back up to the surface, walk along a sidewalk for a bit, and then re-enter another portion of the Pedway later. Last note: I had a perfectly good experience safety-wise when walking in the tunnels. There were a couple panhandlers, but they were pretty passive, and the tunnels are generally in good shape (even if you do feel like you’ve stepped into the 80s at some points).",Chicago Pedway,September 2019,30

From there we visited the Chicago Temple; Picasso's Stature in the Daly Plaza, went into Macy's on State Street to discuss the architecture when it was built as Marshall Field's with the Tiffany and Company designed mosaic ceiling tiles; walked along sections of the Chicago Pedway and ended at the Chicago Cultural Center.

Very interesting museum - house of an early industrialist.,Bill J,"An easy train ride + walk south from the Loop. One of just a few remaining examples of the great mansions along Prairie Ave. Looks like a fortress from the outside, but very interesting interior and French chateau look in its courtyard at the back. Terrific tour, with lots of the history of Chicago. Well worth a visit.",Glessner House Museum,March 2019,50
The signature building of the Prairie Avenue Historic District,Taylor B,"The John J. Glessner House, virtually all that remains of the once magnificent Prairie Avenue Historic District, which featured the Gilded Age homes of Chicago's most famous families, is an architecturally important 19th century residence. Located at 1800 South Prairie Avenue on Chicago's South Side, it was designed in 1885-1886 by architect Henry Hobson Richardson and completed in late 1887. The property was listed as a Chicago Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. It was built for John Jacob Glessner, a farm machinery manufacturer from Springfield, Ohio, who in 1902 merged his company with firms controlled by J.P. Morgan, Cyrus McCormick and James Deering to form International Harvester. He chose to build a home on Prairie Avenue, then the most prestigious residential street in Chicago. It was constructed in the new Richardsonian Romanesque style, which took elements from European buildings of the 11th and 12th centuries. The innovative floor plan and design, including the spacious courtyard, long servant hall and exterior Braggville granite, gave the Glessner House a distinctly different style from other houses on Prairie Street. Saved from demolition in 1966, it was opened for public tours in 1971. Today, many of the rooms have been accurately restored to their original appearance. The museum also features the Jack Simmerling Art Gallery with artwork dedicated to the history of Chicago.",Glessner House Museum,April 2019,50

"Interesting tour, but not my favorite of the weekend",Alexis B,"I visited Chicago this past weekend with family and friends, and it turned out to be a mostly architecture visit! We toured at least 3 or 4 historic buildings, one of which was the Glessner House. I was excited about the tour, because I knew the house is considered architecturally important. However, the tour didn't really get across (at least to me) why that was the case. I understood that the architect (Henry Hobson Richardson) was influential and died young and that many architects were inspired by the house (including Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright), but not why the building was important or inspired other architects. I can't say I found the house beautiful, but the tour was interesting (you do learn quite a bit about the Glessner family, who seemed like very interesting people). Because they only offer a few guided tours at certain times each day (and no self-guided tours), our tour was quite large, and it was a little difficult to fit in every room and to stay on the gray runners (as a very short person, I couldn't always see very much either). All in all, the tour was interesting, but not my favorite of the weekend.",Glessner House Museum,May 2019,30
Don't miss the Jack Simmerling Gallery,Taylor B,"As historians, my wife and I have been faithful supporters of the John J. Glessner House and Museum in Chicago for several years. And we became even more interested after the Glessner House added the John J. ""Jack"" Simmerling Gallery of Prairie Avenue History. Simmerling grew up in south suburban Blue Island, my hometown. In fact, he lived at on one end of the block and we lived on the other. He had a small art studio in his back yard. He became a talented and successful artist and his collection of artwork and architectural artifacts detailing the story of historic Prairie Avenue's years as Chicago's most prestigious residential street in the late 19th century is displayed in the Glessner House. Of course, that's not all. Located at 1800 South Prairie Avenue, it was designed in 1885-1886 by architect Henry Hobson Richardson and completed in late 1887. It was designated a Chicago Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Distinctly different from all other Victorian mansions on South Prairie Avenue, the Richardson Romanesque style building was clad in huge Braggville granite with minimal ornamentation and a long servant hall and spacious private courtyard within. Opened to public tours in 1971, the interior has been restored to its original appearance with decorative objects, artwork and furnishings. For visitors, it is a fascinating look into what life was like during the Gilded Age in Chicago.",Glessner House Museum,November 2019,50

Fun But Crowded,munchkin19,"I came here with a friend and her daughter. The beach is always fun for children and the six year old had a ball. This beach is much nicer then the one at North Avenue, not as much litter and no glass pieces. My complaint is how many people were there, cheek to jowl so to speak. It's nice that they have beach equipment for rent. Lounge chairs with cushions are $10 for the day, and big, sturdy, umbrellas are $20 a day. Cabanas are also available.

The beach is close to the center of town so I can imagine that it's quite crowded on a warm day There's a running and biking path running along and northward of the beach all the way along the concrete beach and all the way to the North Avenue Beach. It seems to be especially popular amongst runners.",Oak Street Beach,October 2019,30
Very nice urban beach,AlexB10499,"I was actually surprised by how nice this lakefront beach was, considering its relative proximity to the Loop. Lots of people were playing volleyball at the nets, and plenty more were sunbathing or swimming – I guess the lake stays warm enough for swimming even to the end of September. The portion of the Lakefront Trail that runs along the beach was packed to the gills. All in all, this is probably a prime piece of real estate in the heat of summer for Chicagoans, but I found it great even as a visitor in early autumn.

Slice of history,AlexB10499,"This is a pleasant Japanese strolling garden in Jackson Park. It was originally built on this site as the “Garden of the Phoenix” with the Japanese pavilion for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, and along with the Palace of Fine Arts Building (now the home of the Museum of Science and Industry), this is one of the only remaining elements of the World’s Fair left in Chicago. The garden has been restored and was being actively maintained when I visited (which was actually kind of inconvenient, since the paths are very narrow).

After the cool maze walkway you’ll find yourself in the taproom where some live music may be playing depending on the time of day; there’s a nice array of seating either at the bar or table seating.

It extends to Armitage Avenue to the North, Clybourn and Halsted Streets to the West, Clark Street to the East and Division Street to the South. North Avenue runs east to west, Wells Street north to south. The area was settled in 1850 by German immigrants. It is popular with architectural buffs who admire Victorian-era buildings. Tree-lined Wells Street features the revered Second City Comedy Club, old-school pubs, charming restaurants, coffee shops and  boutiques. St. Michael's Church is one of the few structures in Chicago to survive the Great Fire of 1871. The area was designated a Chicago Landmark in 1977 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In 1957, the Old Town School of Folk Music opened and Chicago became the center of folk music in the 1960s and 1970s with singer/songwriters such as Bob Gibson, Steve Goodman, Bonnie Koloc and John Prine playing at several clubs on Wells Street, including The Earl of Old Town.

Cocktails While Shopping ... Oh Yeah!,William C,"When you're on the Magnificent Mile, Nordstrom's is well worth a stop. To be candid, I'm not overly fond of their name brands of merchandise for men, but you have to admit that this is a very upscale store. While shopping in the men's department, you have to visit the bar. Yup ... the bar. Right smack-dab in the middle of the second floor just off the up-escalator is the full-service bar. It opens when the store does (10 AM), but hey, somewhere it's five o'clock as the old saying goes. When we get weary of walking The Mile or shopping 'til you drop, stop at the Nordstrom bar and refresh yourself.",Nordstrom,July 2019,40

Be sure you shop here!,patshea2016,"While walking along Chicago’s Magnificent Mile one day last week, I stopped at Nordstrom’s on Michigan Avenue.  It is so conveniently located,  just about a block north of the Chicago River.  It is easily accessible by public transportation.  This is a beautiful store!  Their  shoe department is second to none as they have sizes which are often not available at other nearby stores.  Nordstrom’s has a wide variety of merchandise of great quality.  If you are looking for a gift for somebody, be sure to stop here.  You will find just what you are looking for as their employees go out of their way to be helpful.",Nordstrom,October 2019,50

Neighborhood Around Wrigley,kihyland,"Wrigleyville is the in Lakeside, but is the neighborhood directly surrounding Wrigley Field.  The area around Wrigley Field is very nice and has been recently renovated.  They are currently in the process of building several hotels just across the street from the ballpark!  Get about 2-3 blocks from the field, though and it gets a little shady.  The residential area is nice, but south of the ballpark is a little sketchy.",Wrigleyville,August 2017,40

Wow!,barrym399,"Recently visited this extraordinary facility which was hosting an Andy Warhol exhibition. While this in itself was worth the entrance fee, the selection of paintings by Monet, Picasso, Renoir amongst others was a bonus to put it mildly. We spent a few hours there but in reality only viewed a fraction of the exhibits. There appears to be something for everybody. Superbly located near Millennium Park. A must visit !",The Art Institute of Chicago,November 2019,50

We had a great time in all the room in the middle of the summer; I can only imagine how great this would be in the middle of winter with snow outside!  It is huge, with a million plants; well labeled.  Lots of fun stuff.  If the weather is good, lot of nice landscaping outside as well.

I wouldn’t classify Garfield Park Conservatory as a “must see”, but we certainly enjoyed our walk among the beautiful plants, ferns, trees and flowers and enjoyed the break from the busyness of Downtown Chicago.

You can see beautiful mausoleums from distinguished Chicago families, enjoy a meticulously kept park like setting and not be bothered by the usual urban distractions like cars, homeless, trash, busses etc.  I went there twice this past summer to draw and had a great time.  It isn't creepy either because its so well maintained and does have visitors on tours coming through periodically, so you don't feel isolated or scared.  Also, its large, but not so large you'll get lost.",Graceland Cemetery,September 2019,50

Where Chicago's wealthy are laid to rest,Beemer01,Wow.  I toured Graceland Cemetery (just down the street from Wrigley Field) on an early winter morning that featured a dusting of snow.  I was shooting a 35mm camera with high speed B&W film and got some amazing pictures of the crypts and monuments the wealthy erected for themselves.

One of Chicago's tallest and most distinguished high rises,Taylor B,"Just when you think developers and architects can't design anything bigger or bolder than Lake Point Tower, Jeanne Gang of Studio Gang Architects produces Aqua with its rippling facade of irregular balconies that has been praised by architecture critics for its fascinating visual impact. Located at 255 North Columbus Drive, north of Millennium Park and overlooking Soldier Field and the museum campus on Chicago's lakefront, Aqua is a mixed use 82-story residential skyscraper that rises to a height of 819 feet. It is one of the tallest high rises built during Chicago's skyscraper boom of 2000-2009. Completed in 2009, Aqua is noted for the unique design of its balconies, which give the building a remarkable silhouette. The pattern of undulating balconies, from the tower's base all the way to the top, make for an interesting facade. The effect is especially beautiful when viewed up close, when it looks almost like waves in the ocean, which explains the tower's name. It is a building unlike any other, as is Lake Point Tower. The balconies just don't create a stunning visual effect but they break up the wind streams so the tower needs less resistance against the persistent and strong Chicago winds. The balconies also protrude two to 12 feet outward, allowing for wide views of the area. The tower has received considerable critical acclaim and earned Emporis' 2009 Skyscraper Award. No, it doesn't offer a bird's-eye view of the Chicago Bears' games in Soldier Field.",Aqua Tower,January 2019,50

The museum is expansive, with a wide range if bright spacious galleries that easily handle large crowds. The impressionist gallery has a significant collection of Monet - the largest I have seen outside of Paris. We walked though the special exhibit of Andy Warhol.

Not since 1966,mariana954,"My first time, I visited the Institute in 1966 on a junior high field trip. Decades later, it did not disappoint. We went on a Saturday, and so it was very crowded. There are helpful people who approach you in the special exhibit line and explain that if you want to be members, you can apply your ticket purchases to the membership and skip standing for an hour. My two guests can drive to Chicago from their home, so we did that. There is a LOT to see, and I couldn't manage it all in one day. I was especially glad that Degas' The Little Dancer bronze was there under a lucite/glass cube. I had never seen her up close and personal. There were several impressionists' works, and the special exhibit was Warhol's--quite a variety of his works: film, drawing, the Marilyn and Troy Donahue diptych, the assembly of Brillo boxes. Some graphic nudity (if you are taking little ones, be prepared...) In the lower level we saw the Depression Era photography and the wooden floor squeaked and squeaked constantly. There are drummers outside in the freezing cold and I felt their rhythm all the way into my bones--very loud. I'm sure that it helped them keep warm! ",The Art Institute of Chicago,November 2019,40

I saw dead people,augustdallmanbrill,"Actually saw there graves. This is really a cool place, design considerations are crazy. They really knew how to die back in the day. Most would overlook Graceland but they would be wrong. Cemeteries at one time were put on the outskirts of cities, so that says a lot about the time frame of some of these plots.

unique building,hexalite2k5,"I searched for the Aqua Tower in Chicago because when I saw a pictures of it I was impressed with its unconventional design. Viewed from up close it was equally impressive. It looks different from distance compared to right underneath but I found it to be at its best when you are right near its base looking up. At that point you can clearly understand where the name comes from. Its irregular building blocks give the impression of waves or flowing water while patches of windows reflect the blue sky further emphasizing the watery effect. In addition I found it interesting to hear that it is, quoting Wikipedia, to be  ""the building is the tallest in the world to have a woman as lead architect"". It's really worth a look, it's right in the center and it won't take long to enjoy it.",Aqua Tower,June 2013,50
Condo instead of Hotel......,erdockw,"As our family grows we have began exploring renting condo's on our travels.  The Aqua Tower was our first attempt on our Summer visit to Chicago.  It was perfect!  Beautiful on the inside and out.  Friendly doorman who chatted with us on our every day return, great gym, with indoor basketball court, fabulous outdoor running track.  Location could not be better!  Near everything you want to do in Chicago!  Also nearby is a great grocery store to stock your condo for the trip.  Views from our room were stunning!  I wanted to buy the place!  We had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, fully stocked kitchen, living room with a pullout couch.  Family of 5 had plenty of space.  Our own full washer and dryer unit.

It is a unique building in and of itself, designed to appear as if water is running down its sides.  Part of the reason for the design is to help prevent bird strikes (at least that is what we were told).  The doormen were very friendly and the location was convenient to everything.

I had the opportunity to take my family to visit The Art Institue of Chicago, and what an experience it was.

Worth the flight,Donna H,"I hate to fly, but didn't want to drive to my hotel in downtown Chicago, so I took the plunge and flew and Ubered  to my hotel.

This needs a review? Seriously?,Allan R,Come on people if you don't know The Art Institute of Chicago is on of the world's finest museums of art you must be living under a rock.

"Beautiful, tranquil oasis in a bustling area",Carol M,"I visit here regularly to get away from the noise and chaos of the city. It is a great place for walkers and many use the cemetery as a walking trail. For Taphophiles, this cemetery ranks with Highgate in London or Pere Lachaise in Paris for the beauty of the grounds and its monuments. It is impressively maintained and tours often go there.

Upon arrival, there were tour buses and people walking around respectfully viewing the headstones, mausoleums and the list is endless. You don't think you are in a cemetery.  Yes, I will say this is a hidden gem in Chicago,  because so much history is in this cemetery.  I have lived in Chicago for over ten years and didn't know about this cemetery.

We spent 2.5 hours, which flew by. Wish we had had more time but museum was closing. More than one area to grab something to eat or drink. Love that they encourage picture taking here.

The balcony area sits back from the mezzanine which is truly the front area of the balcony.  Great leg room in row A but during a concert people walk by row A every 30 seconds. The last time we were in the theater we set downstairs. The balcony area gives one a much better view and perspective of this magnificent and elaborate theater.

I love Chicago history, especially the great programming on PBS, and most notably those by Geoffrey Baer, and this museum didn't come close to the entertainment or sophistication of that programing.  I did appreciate the inclusion of the histories of people of color in the museum, but not at the expense of leaving out two extremely large and significant immigrant groups to Chicago: the Germans and Irish. The Poles and Italians were barely mentioned as well.  And no mention of the Catholic Diocese and their gorgeous churches?  I'd recommend a complete do-over after analyzing what other cities are doing around the world, and emphasizing what is unique to this great city, and of interest to all, not just school groups.",Chicago History Museum,October 2019,20

I paid over $100 for 4 people's lunch and it took a very long time to get it to our table.  Once we got it, we realized they gave us the wrong order.

We even ended up back their the next day because we missed it so much and had to get in another trip there before leaving Chicago.  We cannot wait to visit again !",Goose Island Beer Co.,September 2019,50
Top notch tour experience,Cathy K,"We have been on lots of brewery and distillery tours and would say this is likely the best I’ve seen. The process for making beer is the same everywhere so it’s the stories, what you get to see and of course the samples that make a tour great. We arrived to the brewhouse and the bar area is cool. Got a beer in a plastic cup so we could take it along on the tour. Sarah was our guide and she was fantastic. We were a group of 7 so nice size. You make 4-5 stops on the one hour tour. Three samples are provided during the tour. Got to talk to one of the brewers about their experimental beers which was interesting. After the tour we each got a free beer glass. We ended up getting a flight afterwards to try some additional beers. Great value for both our time and money.",Goose Island Beer Co.,October 2019,50

A must see for any reader or writer!,Holly V,This is now going to be one of our repeat visit places in Chicago.  What an amazingly well curated museum.  The creative and engaging design of the museum kept my family entranced.  I loved the Dylan exhibit and learned a new appreciation for him as a true poet.  I am an avid reader -- maybe 60 books per year and I discovered new writers I intend to try.  Given all of that the word waterfall is a must see.  It is a thing of beauty.  I will be back again and again. ,American Writers Museum,August 2019,50

It was a wonderful experience, and I enjoyed spending time exploring the different exhibits.",American Writers Museum,September 2019,50

FLW Beautiful Home,Rachel L,"What can I say?  This is an amazing home, and one of my favorite FLW homes that I have visited.  Robie House is located on the University of Chicago campus, which is a good 45 minute drive from Oak Park.  So if you have tours at both places, allow yourself time to drive.  Our tour guide was so amazing and fun, and you could see the passion she has for what she does.  I'm so glad we visited!",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,October 2019,50
One of the Nicest House Tours Ever,Denise K,"Old-timers - if you've never been inside this house, now you can!  Recently completely redone, you can see it the way those who lived in it were allowed to enjoy, understanding the way it was designed. The docents are excellent and give you an interesting framework for the design and also highlight the history.  Make sure to make a reservation - the tours are smaller and may fill up.  You don't want to miss this one.",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,September 2019,50
Did not disappoint,Robin B,"We had been wanting to visit Robie House for a long time, but the long renovation put us off.  Finally, the home is open for tours and it is well worth a visit.  They are still working on acquiring original or period furnishings, so it is still a work in progress.  Our docent was Grady and he was very good.  He took enough time to fully explain details of the home and the family.  You spend time outside first, then enter the home and visit the ground level, 1st floor main level and bedroom level.  There are not a lot of original furnishings because they were auctioned off, but the home is still lovely and they have done a good job of restoration.  I’m just happy they were able to save the home from demolition by the seminary that wanted to construct a 1950s era dorm on the site.  There is a visitor center/gift shop and restrooms.  Also available for $5 is an audio tour of the immediate neighborhood and University that takes about 30 minutes or less depending on how fast you walk.  Parking is street parking, but we didn’t have any problem finding a space.",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,October 2019,50
Frank Lloyd Wright - visionary architect and social dictator!,J6400SMsue,"The design elements in this first house by FLW demonstrate his visionary style and homage to Japanese building concepts that he so admired.  However I was surprised to learn how dictatorial he was to the Robie family regarding how the house would be furnished, rooms utilised, how they should dress.  The house is very open plan, with lots of decorative but draughty windows and it’s no wonder that they are survived on harsh Chicago winter before domestic issues intervened and they sold.  After several further owners and various inhabitants, the house is now owned by the University of Chicago ( the campus is all around) it has been restored and is regularly open for guided tours.  Book a timed tour on line or prepare to wait to join the next tour with free space.  There is a student type cafe next door in the library building.",Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,October 2019,50

Simply beautiful,HDS1,"First off, realize that the Rookery Building is a working structure with businesses inside, so you're restricted to the main floor lobby area.  But, that's plenty.  The design by Wright makes the wrought iron seem delicate as it arches overhead.  The skylight illuminates all of the delicate features on the walls and the floor.",The Rookery Building,August 2019,50
Wonderful combination of Architects,Harriet M,It is nice for a quick stop but if you have 30 mins take the tour it is really informative about the origins of the building.

Beautiful lobby,SimonG4043,"Not being particularly interested in architecture/design we wouldn’t have gone far out of our way to see this. But it was next door to our hotel!

Iconic,brmusicman,"Marina City (sometimes referred to as the ""corn cobs"") is a residential complex on the Chicago River of some architectural renown.  Goldberg, the architect, was not fond of hard angles, and so the entire building features round edges; the primary building material is concrete.  (For another, lower-rise of Goldberg's aversion to angles and affection for concrete, visit his River City complex in the South Loop.)  You may find them 'of their era' (they were built in the 1960s, but were the first high-rise residential complex built after WWII), but they are iconic and worth seeing!  An office building that was once part of the complex is now a hotel, and the movie theater that was once part of the complex is now the House of Blues; these are open to the public, but the apartments themselves are not.  (Google ""Marina City,"" though, for views of the interior and a sense of what these apartments cost.)  Marina City is easily viewed from the street, riverwalk, or an architecture cruise.",Marina City,December 2019,50

Had to ask her for another drink also. Not good service, not good salads.  Chicken sandwich was just ok. Nothing fancy. Only thing this restaurant has going for it is on the beach.  That's it.  Sad.

"a nice neighborhood on the north side, worth a visit",ochunmimadre,"Andersonville used to be a Swedish community but now is pretty diverse. One of the things I like about it is that it has small, locally owned and operated shops and restaurants, and things are not over priced. One of my all time favorite independent bookstores is here: Women and Children First. This is a feminist bookstore with a large children's section and lots of well-chosen fiction, non-fiction and even some scholarly books. Then there's the Edgewater Produce store, a local Mexican grocery with a great selection of fresh produce at very reasonable prices, a small meat and cheese counter, and all kinds of spices, sauces, and ingredients you need to make Mexican food. I also love Windy Knitty, a great yarn store that offers knitting lessons as well as a comfy place to sit and knit with friends. The employees are super-helpful. Lots of small restaurants, bars, vintage clothing shops, art galleries, gift shops up and down Clark Street. I love the diversity of the neighborhood. It's not a destination in and of itself for outside visitors, but if you are in Chicago and want to see something beyond downtown, you can easily take the train north and walk over to Andersonville for lunch. The boundaries of what is officially Andersonville are a little blurry, but it borders Edgewater, so if you like to walk, you can stroll through the shady neighborhood streets toward the lake and end up at Edgewater beach for a stroll along the waterfront.",Andersonville,August 2015,40

Cool Place to Hang Out,274beckyk,"Not at all touristy, Andersonville is one of the best neighborhoods on Chicago's north side for just hanging out and browsing through the eclectic shops.

A Special Place,Beatriz121,"What a peculiar name for a park, I thought, prior to visiting Oz Park.  What I didn't know was that the inspiration for the name came from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a book written by Lyman Frank Baum who lived in the Lincoln Park area in the late 1800's. What helped complete ""the picture"" for me was seeing the four large statues of characters from the book - Dorothy and Toto, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow. The park was empty during our visit in January, but I'm sure it comes alive with warm weather.  A good stop for anyone, young or old, who loves the book.",Oz Park,January 2015,30

So here we were, two white girls from Texas with suitcases in tow, following the directions Siri gave us to our condo. We walked a few blocks out of the way then found the condo. As soon as we dumped the luggage, we walked down the streets exploring. Everyone was very friendly and the shops and restaurants clean and inviting. We loved all the different restaurants. We also purchased several unique souvenirs from the shop. Everything was so cheap!

Walk about 4 blocks west.  You'll pass through a pretty residential neighborhood to Clark Street (this is the main street of Andersonville).  On Clark Street, wander around to the various shops, bakeries, and restaurants.  This is a great place to find cool gifts at decent prices!

You can walk right from the airport terminal (you don’t even have to go outside) to the the train station. If you have Apple Pay on your phone-you can even just click on that and pay right as you enter. No need to figure out how to buy a ticket or which one. Just go straight to the turnstiles and hold you phone over the reader. Super easy. It is $5.00 ow. It takes about 40 mins-but that is always the same-even during rush hours (which I hear can then take you up to 90 mins to get in the city then). I would highly recommend this-even with luggage.

An Open Stall Market under the Ogilvie Transportation Center,Thoughful-Traveler,"end of the terminal, but it's worth looking.  If you want a decent croissant and cafe au lait, sandwiches and fruit to go for lunch later, or even just a chance to stroll among the stalls and dream of eating everything in sight, it's worth spending an hour here.",French Market,September 2011,40
Great place for lunch,doggy1,Walked from Union Station about 5 blocks away.  We really enjoyed walking around looking at all the different vendors.  Thankfully it was not busy.

I Don't Get It...,SigveL,"No offense to Chicagoans, but I just don't get it. There's nothing special about the building itself and the exhibit inside was a waste of time.

True Chicago History,Nadine B,"It's right on Michigan Avenue so you won't have to go out of your way to see this historic building. It's claim to fame is that it is one of the few buildings to survive the Chicago fire. Plus, it's just a cool looking structure. ",Historic Water Tower,August 2016,50
Chicago Blue Line from O’Hare Airport to Millennium Park,LA_Engineer,It’s extremely convenient to go from Chicago O’Hare Airport on the Blue line to near Millennium park.

Then walked a few blocks to Millennium park.,Chicago Transit Authority - CTA,May 2018,50

Not as engaging as the Art Institute,davidtC7269CS,"The gallery is nice enough, but the exhibitions did not engage or compel me as a viewer. We did enjoy a lunch at Cafe Marisol.

small but mighty,denisemT3534YA,"This museum, like most of Chicago's museums, is awesome. It's smaller than the others, so you can see it in a couple of hours.  The artwork is always thought provoking and interesting. It's right by Michigan Avenue, too,  so you can shop at Water Tower after,( not that I shop). (but ok, maybe sometimes).

When we arrived at our hotel we parked our car and it didn't move for a week.  We bought a week pass for $33, which made the regular $10/daily ticket cost, much less per day.

I went for the architecture,Lia D,I couldn't help but just want to go in once I saw the beautiful architecture on the outside!

The only building in its area to survive the Chicago Fire of 1918, it was responsible initially to draw water (indirectly) from nearby Lake Michigan as well as to store water and if necessary, minimise the effect of surging water levels.

Parking is available, but this is an easy walk from the Loop. Located in the neighborhood known as the Fulton River District, it is in fact at street level, (tracks are at 2nd level) and there are tables outside as well as in. The long rows of stalls, with a huge variety of food offered makes you wish you could spend all day. From traditional French crepes and pastries, to Montreal-style deli meats, to artisan cheeses and breads - there is something for everyone. Raw food vegetarian to mini-donuts cooked to order, and flowers, and farm-stand produce spilling out into the station concourse. Everything is available for take-away, so you can spend time there, or make a picnic somewhere along the nearby river. Vendors are friendly and personable, and there was live music offered on the day I visited. Leave plenty of time for browsing!",French Market,May 2013,50

I went to get a sandwich, and they said they ran out of baguettes. I ended eating an American sandwich. I was really really disappointed.

A Calder Masterpiece,Chuck A,"Calder's Flamingo sculpture is a modern masterpiece.  It shows a flamingo with its head in the granite.  When flamingos are in danger, they bury their heads so that attacking animals become confused about what they originally went after.  Like flamingos, this sculpture represents bureaucrats who ignore issues in an attempt to escape work.  Federal government offices surround the plaza, which was years late from completion.  The flamingo sculpture also adds a burst of color in an otherwise dark plaza and provides a great foreground for pictures in the plaza if you photograph it from various angles..

Afternoon tour,ButchsTravels,"I had a free afternoon and since this was down the street I thought it would make an interesting experience. I found the overall experience a little pricey and the exhibits small.  The entrance fee ($12) was not exorbitant, but when I had seen every piece of art on exhibit a little over an hour later, I thought it a bit steep. The quality of the exhibits was high, and the displays were top notch. The art was interesting and challenging, and the accompanying descriptions did an excellent job of describing the piece in context. I was happy to see several school age groups going through getting what seemed to be a very personal and engaging tour.

If you are visiting in the spring or summer do not forget to visit the outdoor Sculpture garden.

An impressive church with great acoustics,Gabriel H,"Located toward the Northern end of the magnificent Mile, this is a beautiful building. The church itself is a magnificent Gothic building, although it was only built in 1920. The soaring nave focuses the eye on the spectacular ceiling and the simple, main altar. On both sides the windows exhibit stunning stained glass. The church has magnificent acoustics, a feature that is frequently on display with frequent voice and organ concerts. The new organ, an American symphonic organ, was installed in November 2015, replacing an earlier, also excellent instrument. This is the largest organ in Chicago, with five keyboards, 143 ranks and 8,343 pipes! On the outside, parts of the church, and the parish house, cloister, manse, and garth are covered by vine. The contrast between the baroque church and the modern high-rises on Northern Michigan avenue is stunning. The church brings a sense of peace and serenity to this bustling part of the city.

There are concerts at other times too, so lok for announcements on the website",Fourth Presbyterian Church,June 2017,50
Lovely Church,Adiona25,This church is located right at the Magnificent Mile; it offers a nice respite from the large shopping crowds. Lovely gothic church with a nice stained glass window dating back from ~1930. The surrounding gardens are also beautiful.,Fourth Presbyterian Church,September 2016,50
Right in the Train Station,LFL101,"Handy spot to pick up something for dinner on your way to Metra train.  Good bread, cheese, deli items, great desserts.   If you're having trouble finding it, just ask someone.  Union Station needs something like this instead of that crummy food court.",French Market,February 2014,40
Culture Explosion of Flavors,traveltrini,"I must say I thoroughly enjoyed my visits to the French Market, it was a culinary wonderland, the people warm and inviting, eager to educate and offer a taste into their world. I can't wait to visit again next year!",French Market,March 2014,50

Fantastic!,kersaraam,"We loved our visit to this great museum, despite the fact that it was very cold out and we arrived an hour before it opened!  It was worth the wait.  African Americans have a rich history in Chicago and it was wonderful to learn about it.  We were also fortunate enough to be there to see the ""Journey of Hope"" quilt display.  A very impressive collection and an amazing tribute to your President and First Lady.  ",DuSable Museum of African American History,January 2012,50
Great Museum!,SHIRLEY F,"The exhibits were wonderful.  The tree I liked best were the History of Gospel Music, the Quilts Inspired by President Barack Obama and the Mayor Harold Washington wing.",DuSable Museum of African American History,February 2012,50
Was expecting more,Carl C,"I have lived in Chicago for about 15 years now and have always heard that the DuSable Museum of African American History was a wonderful place to visits.  I was a little disappointed.  The building itself was spacious and well maintained.  However, there was not a lot to see once inside.  I was surprised that most of the museum was dedicated to the history of gospel music.  There was also a very large area primarily for the late Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago.  Although I would agree that these areas are of great importance in the history of African American life, it would seem like there was a lot left out.  I was also surprised to not see a lot about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  or even very much about any other civil rights leaders.  The museum focused mostly on the African American history in Chicago.  There was a large gallery on the lower level that I assume was a space for rotating shows.  A guilt Obama inspired quilt show was in this space.   I went thinking I would learn something new, but I left not only without any new information, but also with a feeling of, “what was the point?”  With a city as big as Chicago I would have thought there would have been more.",DuSable Museum of African American History,April 2012,30
"Hot sand, cold water",OKTravelingFamily,Went on the hottest day in Chicago in 7 years.  The sand was unbareably hot.  Saw many people running and children crying because of it.  The water however was ice cold.  What a contridiction.  Still a great little beach right next to Navy Pier.  Not as crowded and a nice spot for families.  ,Ohio Street Beach,June 2012,30
Quiet water therapy,middleof,"I took a walk down LSD for want of the lake breeze and found the under street tunnel that lead to this nice beach area!  There were bikes for rent, and a port o potty.  The sand was nice, the water nicer!  Trails lead to Navy Pier and I found water fountains there for a nice drink on the City Water Works Station side.",Ohio Street Beach,May 2012,40
Great sand and shallower water,Rather_Nomadic,"We preferred this beach over Oak Street. The sand was softer and the water was much shallower, with no drop-off. The sand continued well out into the water without any rocks. Our kids loved it. No dedicated restrooms but there are facilities up in the Jane Addams park. Easy to access from Navy Pier and also the Oak Street underpass.",Ohio Street Beach,July 2012,40
Needs a washroom facility,julb817,We went to watch the practice for the Air and Water show.  The only problem is there is not a bathroom facility anywhere close.  Definite downside to staying at the beach for a couple of hours.  We had to walk several blocks and a kind person let us in the key code only bathroom near the marina.,Ohio Street Beach,July 2012,30
White sand beach in the heart of the city,Kyra S,"We loved this beach.  Walking distance from the hotels we stayed at with a beautiful bike path along the water and a bike rental location right off the beach path.  Water was clear and warm with gentle waves, perfect for swimming.  We enjoyed this spot so much that we visiting twice during our 4 days in Chicago.",Ohio Street Beach,August 2012,50
Part of historic Mies van der Roche designed federal complex,RusPat_704,Try to visit on Tuesdays when they have the farmers market. The architecture speaks for itself and the Calder sculpture is a contrast to the steel and glass buildings ,Calder’s Flamingo,September 2016,50
A Great Calder,RickMIusa,"The Flamingo is one of Calder's best known.  We have an earlier one where I live in Grand Rapids, MI, same whimsy, same orange, it represents the rapids here.  So, it's always fun to see Chicago's.....there are lots of other monumental sculptures within a block or so, so walk a bit....Chagall, Picasso, etc.  check them all out, there are website with maps so you can find them a bit easier than just at random.....",Calder’s Flamingo,April 2016,50
A beautiful piece of art,seeKristenTravel,"The Flamingo Sculpture is this big, bright, and beautiful sculpture that really stands out against the concrete landscape it's encompassed by. Definitely something to see for yourself as the photos don't do the scene as much justice as being there for yourself truly does. Recommended weekdays in the morning (after the work rush) for the best photos with the least amount of people. That, or first thing as soon as the sun rises. You won't be disappointed.",Calder’s Flamingo,April 2016,40
Walk around the loop/ so many beautiful things to see,john b,"Not only this sculpture but the fountains at Citi Bank, their Calder wall, and of course the Picasso at the City Building.While you are walking go in and see the lobbies of the Rookery, City/County Building, The Board of Trade and the Macy's store which use to be Marshall Field's.

Another ethnic neighborhood,LittleLassie,"This neighborhood used to boast of its ethnic flavor of Swedish but alas as things are never static, this too is slowly eroding. It is still a vibrant area with restaurants and shops. Worth a visit...",Andersonville,May 2012,30
"This pic does not do justice to this upscale, family friendly neighborhood.",smdyl,"Andersonville might just be one of the best eclectic neighborhoods in Chicago.  Guaranteed to find every single demographic the census bureau offers.  Has a ""small town"" feel. Many families. Good restaurants, lots of interesting boutiques, many good used furniture stores, good toy store, good independent book store:  Women and Children First.  Must go to George's for ice cream and sweets and to Wooly Mammoth on Foster Ave. for unusual (taxidermy, old toys) stuff to buy.  Gethsemene Garden Center is the best in the area.",Andersonville,August 2012,50
Pretty Edgy,Peter B,"This is a very modern art museum. It was pretty edgy and I didn’t really get a lot of it. Maybe it was just me, but it wasn’t my favorite. ",Museum of Contemporary Art,July 2018,30
Nice Facility; Great Location,Trent W,"We stopped here on July 10.  Some of our kids like art and we opted for this as opposed to the Chicago Art Institute mainly due to cost.  We thought MCA would be a cheaper stop and boy were we right.  Since we have three students and a military member, we did not have to pay anything for our kids.  They enjoyed it.  There were nice places for me and my wife to sit while we waited.  We even got to listen to a little bit of jazz as it was jazz night at MCA.  ",Museum of Contemporary Art,July 2018,50
Expected More,noxiousburrito,"From the museum's website and other's reviews I had high expectations of the museum, but they fell short. I live in a small city and the modern art section of our art museum has more prestigious artists featured, and more exhibits. I thought the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art would hold all sorts of surprises. I'm disappointed.",Museum of Contemporary Art,July 2018,20

The new is ever-present,619jeffry,"When we saw a whole lot of  children playing games like 'Anti Monopoly'. we though it was a play area, but it turns out they were part of the exhibit, by artist Joan Giroux. This is why one comes to a cotemporary art museum -- to find something which overturns your preconceptions. Joan Giroux was talking about encroachment on play in public places. We spent all afternoon in the MCA and saw it all. It's not as big as the Art Institute, but the exhibits are both interesting and challenging. By the way, the guided tours are very informative, check on times,.",Museum of Contemporary Art,August 2018,50
Site seeing and lunch,166darleneh,We were given a tour of Chinatown by an Asian friend who lives and has a business near Chinatown. I took pictures of the first Chinese catholic school and church. Also a town square with statues of the Chinese zodiac. We ate lunch at a great restaurant and our friend took us to a bakery. It was interesting to see Walgreens and US bank advertising in English and in Chinese. So a great afternoon had by all. ,Chicago Chinatown,May 2018,40
Food Food Food,Jacirae,I think movies give the everyone the wrong idea of what china really has. Every few feet just past the gate you could smell wonderful good. I cant comment if it was good as it smelled as I dragged to the kpop store and no one wanted to eat Chinese for lunch (go figure). The parking sign was in chinese but had some english and the price it showed was if you had a lunch voucher so of course we paid twice as much for the short time we were there. Lesson learned. I would like to explore it more the next time we go.,Chicago Chinatown,April 2018,30
Great Experience,WorldTravelers1999,"We visited China to adopt our daughter back in February 2016.

Oh so easy!,TravelFan48105,"Took the orange line CTA train from Midway Airport and back.  Even for a first time rider from/to Midway, the system is super-simple and easy.  There are vending machines for tickets of various types, then hop on the train to downtown and connect to other lines if needed.  No worries about parking, traffic, stress, etc. I picked up a map at the booth at Midway which was helpful.  Price is $3 per ride (includes 2 hours for transfers) for the tourist and that certainly can't be beat! Trains are clean and quiet.  A great experience.",Chicago Transit Authority - CTA,September 2018,50
Survived the fire,spinkick,"This is one of the first watertowers built in the city prior to the great fire.

Beautiful Church Welcoming and Refreshing,MrGlen,"The music on the Sunday I attended was presented by their women's choir.  I was most impressed with their choral tone and perfect intonation.  They added so much beauty to the service with their song along with the skillful fingerings of the organist.  The organ prelude, postlude and service music were thoughtful and tempered thoughtfully on this Sabbath day which came on the heels of a national disaster in our country.  The senior minister was most engaging.  Her morning message was well constructed and delivered with sincere honesty and compassion.  I enjoyed her style of ministering to the flock on this particular Sunday.  I received a nicely worded letter a few days later at my home thanking me for attending and inviting me back the next time I am in Chicago.  I will most definitely return.",Fourth Presbyterian Church,September 2017,50

",French Market,August 2014,40
You will Love it!,quietlycool,"Okay, so it's not France, and it's not even very French, but it IS a great little market.  From the florist to crepes there's something for everyone.  When we go to Chicago we try to make time to stop at the French Market and take something home (and this is not our train line, so we make special effort to go to Ogilvie Station before heading over to Union).  Our favorite return trip tradition is a sushi roll from EJ Sushi, some cheese and a couple bottles of beer from Pastoral.  (While the cheese usually makes it home, the Sushi & beer is for the ride home). Seating can be an issue if you're looking to eat there so once you've found a spot figure out a way to keep it, or sit outside the actual market area in some of the seating in the hall/concourse leading to the trains (there's other stores out there like CVS).  Whatever you do, at some point in your train travels or just during your shopping time, check out this ""hidden"" gem and enjoy the year-round experience at Chicago's own French Market.   I really don't think you'll be disappointed!",French Market,September 2014,40
Fun afternoon,GeneG547,"Not sure why this is called French - its more eclectic.  Maybe there is something French there - I must have missed it. It was however a fun afternoon looking at the different foods - eating etc.  There are dozens of food stands - like a food court in a big mall, but not chain food.  There were also a number of market places for meat, fish, fruit etc.  Marketplace prices were on the whole not bad - especially the fruits.  The eateries were also on par for Chicago.  From lobster rolls to hamburgers, smoothies and great desserts there is a lot to choose from.",French Market,March 2015,40

I wanted to see more such as the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 and things like that but they have a lot of African artifacts and things like that if your into that.

One of the best in the world,Rrrryan,I'm from Chicago and although I have always loved the MCA I never realized what an absolutely treasure it is until I began comparing it with all the museums I have visited across the States and Europe. The MCA always has an exciting exhibition on display along with it's (EXCELLENT) permanent collection. It's not a huge museum but definitely a palatable size for everyone. I have enjoyed so many amazing exhibitions over the years from Jeff Koons to Takashi Murakami to Kara Walker. The space is beautifully designed and I especially love the staircase. Highly recommend for art and culture lovers.,Museum of Contemporary Art,June 2018,50

Took the blue line to the red line to get to guaranteed field a couple of days. Was a bit confusing at the loop but I just asked a couple and they were very kind to help me out. It was I bit confusing at the airport also to get to CTA but I found it. Traveled one day on the blue line and then a bus to get to Wrigley Field (got off at Addison on to bus 152).

It's hard not to notice it and its companion building across Michigan Ave and it's interesting to note that this structure is one of the few public buildings that survived the Great Fire of 1871. So while going from designer store to designer store do take the time to stop and appreciate this wonderful piece of architecture that despite a great fire and years of modern development it has been able to survive for so long! ,Historic Water Tower,November 2017,40

I just happened to stroll by while visiting Chicago and I'm so glad I did! It's a nice place to sit and enjoy a cold soda while enjoying the fresh air and green grass. The landscaping is lovely and the Wizard of Oz statues are a bonus, making for excellent photo opportunities. If you are a Wizard of Oz fan, I'd highly recommend this park.",Oz Park,June 2015,40

Good lunch spot,FirstCircle,"This place is maybe not that easy to find, but it is a pretty good place for someone walking around the loop and looking for some food.  There is little specifically Chicago food here, rather it is mostly foreign influences.  Still there are a lot of good options - we had bahn mi and belgian fries.  It is a bit pricey, but it is the closest that Chicago has to a big market in the city center.",French Market,April 2015,40

Much History In A Nice Museum,Lady4Evermore,"I visited this museum some time ago, when my son and I took a plane trip to Chicago, when he was a young teenager (around ten years ago).  At the time, we really enjoyed visiting it and there was much black history to explore there   The museum was well-maintained and easy to get to (I remember we took a short bus trip, from the nearest subway stop, to get there).  Based on the recent TripAdvisor reviews, it's good to know the museum is still a great place to learn more about black history and the significance of it.",DuSable Museum of African American History,December 2013,50
A must stop for exploring Black history,Taylor B,"I attended a virtually all-white high school in the 1950s and a mostly all-white university in the 1960s. So my first real association with African Americans came in 1968 when I became high school sports editor of the Chicago Daily News and began covering football and basketball games on Chicago's South Side on a regular basis. It was a fascinating education, especially because I was learning during the tumultuous era surrounding the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I had heard about the Du Sable Museum of African American History, which was established in 1961, but I didn't visit until almost 10 years later. At first, it was out of curiosity, to see how much I didn't know and how much I still had to learn. But in the wake of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington's death and other recent events that impacted on black (and white) history, a visit to the Du Sable Museum was a way of keeping up with the times. The Du Sable Museum is the first and oldest museum dedicated to the study and conservation of African American history, culture and art. It was founded in 1961 by Dr. Margaret Taylor Burroughs and others. Located at 740 East 56th Place at the corner of Cottage Grove on Chicago's South Side in the Washington Park neighborhood, it was renamed for Jean Baptiste Point du Sable in 1968. Du Sable was a Haitian fur trader and the first non-Native American permanent settler in Chicago. The new 25,000-square-foot wing contains a permanent exhibit on Harold Washington with memorabilia, personal effects and other highlights of his political career. The museum has a collection of 13,000 artifacts, books, photographs, art objects and memorabilia. There is a 466-seat auditorium, part of the new wing, that hosts community-related events, including jazz and blues music series, poetry readings and film screenings. There also is a gift shop and research library. Besides the Harold Washington exhibit, other interesting exhibits include a history of blacks in the Armed Forces and paintings, drawings and sculptures of black artists, the story of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, Thomas Miller mosaics and the Freedom Now mural, carvings that illustrate 400 years of African American history including such notables as Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois and Mary Mcleod Bethune and the 1981 Nate Turner-led slave revolt. It's a lot of history that blacks and whites need to comprehend and understand.",DuSable Museum of African American History,December 2014,50

This is where the Cubs celebration was held and the Christmas Marketplace comes in the late fall. About the only thing it is useful for is as a place to join up with somebody.

Disappointing,JoeMR,"Compared to other modern art museums around the country (and around the world), MCA compares badly. The collection isn't first-rate, with very little that's truly amazing. Although I'm a fan of modern art, I find few pieces here to enjoy -- most I think are somewhat silly. Chicago deserves better.",Museum of Contemporary Art,October 2018,20
One of the world's largest contemporary art venues,Taylor B,"The Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago was created as a result of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics, collectors and dealers with the idea of organizing and building a museum of contemporary art to complement the city's Art Institute of Chicago. And so it was opened in 1967 at 237 East Ontario. But it quickly outgrew its surroundings. In 1996, the four-story, 220,0000-square-foot building designed by Josef Paul Kleihues was opened at the museum's current address, 220 East Chicago Avenue, site of a former National Guard Armory. The architecture of the museum, located near Water Tower Place in the Streeterville neighborhood, is said to reference the modernism of Mies van der Rohe as well as the tradition of Chicago architecture. It is noted for its signature staircase leading to an elevated ground floor, which has an atrium, the full glass-walled east and west facades giving a direct view of the city and Lake Michigan. The collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art is composed of thousands of objects of post-World War II visual art. It is divided into three programming departments--curatorial, performance and education. The museum is open from 10 to 5 on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday and from 10 to 9 on Tuesday and Friday. Its collection consists of 2,700 objects and more than 3,000 artists books. Works of art from 1945 to the present include examples of late surrealism, pop art, minimalism and conceptual art from the 1940s through the 1970s. Works from the 1980s can be grouped under post modernism and painting, sculpture, photography, video, installation and related media that current artists explore. Notable works on display include Study for a Portrait (1949) by Francis Bacon; Jackie Frieze (1964) by Andy Warhol; Untitled (1970) by Donald Judd; Rabbit (1986) by Jeff Koons; Cindy (1988) by Chuck Close; Retroactive II (1963) by Robert Rauschenberg; and The Wonder of Nature (1953) by Rene Magritte. Along with its counterparts in New York City and Washington DC, there is nothing to compare to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. ",Museum of Contemporary Art,November 2018,50
"Small, not that interesting",Hawaiirocks1,"My wife and two young sons went for an afternoon visit.  The museum is just off the Mag Mile so it’s a nice break from eating and shopping.  The museum property is nice, but that’s about all I can say about it.  It’s actually quite small and there aren’t a lot of exhibits on display.  Even if the pieces were fantastic you could get through the whole museum in 30 minutes.  This is a subjective call but none of the pieces were interesting.  $15 per adult, kids free.

There also appeared to be drug transactions at Jackson, and for sure saw harassment of young women traveling alone.  Very dangerous and certainly not a good piece of public relations for your city.

I ordered two 7-day transit passes online in mid-November for our trip in early January. By the middle of December the cards had still not arrived in the mail. VENTRA Customer Service blamed it on everyone except themselves - first they said I was wrong, and then they actually said ""Our employees are 100% honest but those U.S. Postal Service employees steal things all the time."" But they had no proof of having ever sent the cards at all. They refused to send me new cards without charging me a second time, and they refused to give me a refund, so I had to dispute the charge with my credit card company. They were rude, accusatory and defensive.

But the Water Tower's main claim to fame is that it is one of only a very few structures that remained standing after the great Chicago fire in 1871. It is a popular tourist attraction of the Magnificent Mile. Home of the City Gallery, the city's official photography gallery which presents Chicago themed photography exhibitions by Chicago photographer.

Spent more time in the museum shop, which is a gold mine of art books",Museum of Contemporary Art,February 2019,30
Quite disappointing compared to previous visits when the Gift Shop is the Highlight,johnlincolnpark,"My girlfriend and I were both rather disappointed in our mid-February 2019 visit, we expected to spend 90 minutes there and we had ""experienced"" everything in the museum in 30 minutes (we did not rush).  Granted some areas were closed, but the existing exhibits, with some exceptions, were generally quite underwhelming including the ""creepy carpet"" exhibit.  Absolutely a 20 year low in content and inspiration this was the first museum visit in our lives where we considered asking for our money back.  The Modern Art and thought-provoking aspect of the items in the gift shop was the zenith of our visit.  Consider waiting until late spring to visit...",Museum of Contemporary Art,February 2019,20

Short trip to Chicago,CHRISTIAN W,"We planned a trip to watch our South Florida Bulls collage football team play in Chicago.  Our team won so the trip was successful!  We attended a Cubs game and that was great.  We are Joe Maden fans and the Cubs won.  China town was ok, just fine.  Walking down town Chicago was great for a small town Southern boy from Florida.  I liked the baseball and football better.",Chicago Chinatown,September 2018,30
Chinatown,Solodam J,"Most of the big cities has Chinatown, so is here in Chicago. It's typical Chinatown, a little bit chaotic, not very neat, shops with all chinese / asiatic things, restaurants, chinese supermarket,  temple etc. When you know how to find a place for the food and yummy things, you will sure enjoy it. Most of such places are a bit hidden. There is a nine dragon wall, a chinese style gate, a square with all the chinese zodiac, and some other shops. It is easy to come here with metro ( cermak metro station). The dragon lanterns are beautiful",Chicago Chinatown,September 2018,40
Small but cute,Yun C,"Chicago's Chinatown is much smaller than some other Chinatowns in other big cities like NYC or LA, but has good variety of stores, restaurants and cultural heritage centers. It is also convenient with access via public transportation, and a quick 10 minutes drive from downtown Chicago without traffic. The reason of a 3 star vs. higher takes consideration of the surrounding environment and safety. There are also some visible cleanliness issues with some of the stores. Service quality can be improved too. It's not easy to find a public restroom either.",Chicago Chinatown,October 2018,30
This is the Way to Travel Chicago,Cheryl C,"The only people who suffer driving in Chicago are masochists as gridlock is the way of life.  You can walk to your destination faster, or, like me, utilize a brilliant transit system called the CTA which will get you where you want to go in several different ways so you can truly visit Chicago in all of its glory.  There is so much to see in its neighborhoods than just Downtown.  As your hotel for a lead on one of the hoods depending on what you like to or want to do and then get the CTA.  Ask questions, don't be afraid. We Chicagoans want you to have a world class experience, trust me.

"Take the ""L"" when possible",interceptpubs,"Driving in Chicago, particularly downtown, is a real pain. When we can, we park our vehicle close to a station and use the ""L"" to go wherever we want. It's fast (considering the high probability of getting in a traffic jam somewhere in Chicago at any given time) and comparatively cheap in both money and stress. We sometimes stay way out and take Metra into where we can connect to CTA to reduce stress further.",Chicago Transit Authority - CTA,October 2018,50
Chicago Must Experience!,Dolores P,"We felt it was essential to take a ride on the ""L"" during our first Chicago visit. After exiting the Willis Tower we headed to the Quincy station (which was only a block away) to take the Orange line around the Loop to the Washington/Wabash station, which was close to Millennium Park.  The alleyway from Willis Tower to Quincy station (W Jackson Blvd) was God-awful -- trash everywhere & reeked of an odor I can't describe. Once at the Quincy station we purchased one trip passes ($3 per adult) and asked several locals just to verify that what we were doing was correct.  Nothing exciting, but felt it was something we wanted to be able to say that we did.",Chicago Transit Authority - CTA,March 2019,30

A Beloved Chicago Landmark,MaryinChicago,The Historic Water Tower is one of those iconic Chicago buildings.  Thank goodness it was made a landmark!

Worth the visit,Angels45069,"Video showed me a lot of background into the blues, which is the basis for ALOT of rock - amazed at how many of my favorite songs were just covers by the rolling stones, Clapton, etc. or work done by these blues artists.   $10 fee to get in - WELL worth the cost.

My story of Willie Dixon,JanetStagg,"As a child growing up in the 70's, Shirley and I would go to her father's home at lunchtime.  This is when, kids could go home, watch tv, play, eat with parents or visit your friends home.   Shirley and I along with her dad  Willie Dixon, and her mother, would listen to him play that Guitar and sing his sons.  He had records and he was so Jolly and Full of Love.  Shirley, looked like her dad and she was an Awesome Person.  This is where I learned all about the Blues.   After school, I'd tell my mom and she would recant how she danced on 47th Street and 63rd Street, the ""Club DeLisa,''   I used to visit Kingstone Mine, Blues Alley across the street and Lee's Unleaded Blues, and my cousin still plays down on Beal Street in Memphis.   Yes, Chicago needs to build this City up and Praise the Blues.    Thank you, grandson of Willie Dixon, an old friend of your aunt, Janet Lunn.

What a great find,JoseyJoenotts,"This place is a little piece of joy, dozens of delightful and delicious food stands from all around the world, making street food.

The exhibits were interesting. There were quite a few interesting multi-media enhancements that were very informative. I am looking forward to returning. My only comment is that the gift shop was not on par with other museum shops. They did not have much merchandise and little of it was linked to the museum's exhibits.

Some hidden architectural gems if you wander just a bit off the main Clark Street drag.  Eclectic, trendy and fun.  Worth spending a day strolling the neighborhood, having breakfast of Swedish pancakes and lingonberries with Swedish sausage at Svea... or a lunch/dinner at Reza's.

This is a great area where diversity abounds, families thrive, and interesting people gather.  There are lots of eating and drinking choices for all tastes, as well as dress shops, a toy store, wine and cheese, specialty olive oil, and a wonderful independent bookstore.

We got followed around the shop and didn't end up buying anything. We walked some more and browsed menus. We finally settled on Triple Crown for lunch, see review on that, but overall we liked it.

"Half Assed ""Tour"", But Worth A Visit",Jim T,"We visited the home of Chess Records and paid for a tour. ($10) We were led upstairs to what used to be the recording studio (Muddy Waters/Chuck Berry/Buddy Guy/The Rolling Stones, etc.) and entered to watch a film on the history of Chess records that had already started. When the film was over (we have no idea how much we missed, but I am guessing around half) we wandered to a room in back which held a few instruments, costumes and memorabilia. Returning downstairs to the entrance/gift shop area, we looked down the hallway and were told 'There's more back there'. We then looked in the back lower room which held a photo exhibit , more Chess memorabilia and inexplicably, a display on The Who. There are T-shirts and CDs and the like available for purchase, if they happen to have your size.

There was a very informative DVD about Chess Records, shown in the old recording studio where the Rolling Stones and all the great blues singers of the time recorded their classic songs. 2015 is Willie Dixon's centenary year which made the visit that big more special.

You get to walk up the same stairs and hold the same handrail that Willie, Muddy, Buddy, Little Walter, Etta, Koko, Aretha, Mick, Keith, Charlie, Slowhand and countless other legends touched. You get to hold and play Willie' bass. You can go into the recording booth and checkout some original equipment and lookout over a large recording room. You can sit and play on Watt's drum kit.

Keith Dixon gives a wonderful tour of the building and its history bringing to life what has happened there and linking this to how the Foundation continues to support musicians today. If you have any interest in music or popular culture this is a must see on any visit to Chicago.,Willie Dixon's Blues Heaven Foundation,October 2015,50
beautiful spiritual sanctuary,853jand,"Visit this Church when in Chicago. Take a break from the shoping, business, crowd. Step in, sit down, say a prayer; give some rest to your feet and if it's time for service, share it with those around you.  ",Fourth Presbyterian Church,September 2018,50
Pure Beauty and Serenity...,Steven D,"This is an amazing church along North Michigan Avenue.  The architecture, the music, the beauty is worth a visit.  It is not the most fancy church you can visit, but it is a beauty none the less.  If you want to step off of the hustle and bustle of the Mag Mile, this is a true sanctuary that will give you peace and quiet, while surrounded by beauty.

Cute park! ,johnmyhre,"The Oz sculptures made this park worth it! Make sure to listen to the voices of the characters, makes it very interactive. The cute boys playing tennis were also not bad to look at. ",Oz Park,July 2016,40

Ok...I can say I have been there.,Kristina M,"I am a big WOZ fan, thinking it is OZ Park I guess I was expecting a little more.  Yes, that statues were cool and they talk to you - but you have to download the app by the Lion and my kids had fun at Dorothy's playground...but no yellow brick road.  No fun colorful things on the playground like in Munchkinland.    ",Oz Park,August 2016,30

Not What We Had Expected,jmcnabb84,"This place is not so much of a ""Market"" as much as it is just a food court. Very limited in what you can buy besides a meal for lunch. The food was very good though. Just do not go if you are expecting more of a market place.",French Market,February 2018,30
Lots of Tasty Offerings ,792maureenc,Met our son for lunch and loved the large variety of food offerings for breakfast and lunch. It helped us to walk around and take time to explore each menu before our son arrived! So many choices. The pastrami sandwiches were think and extremely tasty. The soups were delicious-hot and accompanied by a tasty baguette. Everyone was friendly-good service at the two places we selected. ,French Market,April 2018,40
Not worth the walk,sydneywanda,Went in search of food variety to French Market. Not worth the walk as the food offerings are sub standard. We had Pastrami Sandwiches at Bebes Kosher expecting an overfilled New York variety. Instead it was an ordinary sandwich!!,French Market,April 2018,30
The BEST place to take foodie friends ,StephanieG233,I took a load of people with lots of opinions and different diets to The French Market.  It was perfect.  Lots of choices.

Museum Named After the Founder of Chicago,LittlePampu,"I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Burroughs before she passed. Her hard work paid off in creating this museum. It's a small museum and not as large as the well-funded museums in the city. However, it has exhibits true to the African-American experience. The museum also holds events such as concerts, talks, book signings, etc. in it's auditorium. Every year it holds a free Arts and Crafts Festival. At the festival, you can find paintings, books, clothes, jewelry, food, etc. and meet the creators of each. The pricing is very reasonable and live music and dance is featured as well. Rumor has it that 2017 is the last year. I sincerely hope not.",DuSable Museum of African American History,July 2017,50
Necessary & In Need Of More Donors,Lorraine G,This museum is a small gem but it could be a bigger one. The space seems under utilized but also feels that there is not enough care or attention paid to it. ,DuSable Museum of African American History,March 2017,40

Come prepared,Daniel A,"I didn’t know there were beaches in Lake Michigan near the city of Chicago. In hindsight it makes sense but if you don’t know, you don’t know. Once I knew, I wish we had come prepared with food and drinks. We stayed for just a little while to see the place but if I come to Chicago again, I will come fully prepared to enjoy this cool little beach in a city.",Ohio Street Beach,June 2017,40
We love this beach,meganr8448,"While we love this beach, it does need cleaned up. There was a dead seagull towards the shore today and was a bit upsetting to see. Also lots of garbage was in it. ",Ohio Street Beach,July 2017,40

Outstanding Calder Sculpture,Stan K,I always stop when I am walking on Adams Street and in the vicinity of the Federal Plaza to look and photograph this amazing structure. On several occasions I made a photo trip to capture it.,Calder’s Flamingo,April 2018,50
Viewed on a Bus Tour,purplehaze20,I was looking forward to seeing this guy while we had a very wet rainy visit in Chicago. We had stayed downtown and my original plan was to see it at night or walk to but the weather was not optimal for that type of view. However the sculpture itself is huge and is worth seeing even if only in a drive by on the bus.,Calder’s Flamingo,April 2018,30

Just across the street from Pilsen Vintage was a wonderful Coffee shop, this has to be one of the BEST Vanilla Chia Latte's I've ever had, fresh baked goods there too.  So Many restaurants in the area that would loved to have tried, saving that for another trip and warmer weather. A lot of potential for more shops.",Pilsen,February 2015,50
Stole my heart,keeshaweesha,"As a Mexican from California where we account for a huge number of the population, I was pleasantly surprised to see a huge Mexican culture in Pilsen.  Not only that, but it was yet to be fully gentrified which is unheard of in these days. The whole community seemed to be proud of the rich culture.  What truly stole my heart was all the art I would stumble upon whether I was walking in the neighborhood or in one of the local restaurants. Normally neighborhoods are quick to paint over murals or graffiti or peel stickers away from where they are ""unwanted"".  But, not this one.  They welcome ""free posting"" on bulletins around the city, and leave art all around the community.  Pilsen is close to the ""city"", only about 10 minute drive, 20 minute bike ride if your up for using DIVVY bikes.  I will definitely return to Pilsen, I had such a good experience.  I would consider living here if I ever made a move to Chicago.  Love a community that embraces culture!",Pilsen,June 2015,50

Shopping the many vintage stores,Kathy A,"Pilsen is one of those neighborhoods that have gone through great changes.  Hipsters have moved in so you can find several vintage stores, really cool restaurants and coffeeshops, and several art studios.  Very culturally mixed, but still the feel of the city.  I still visit during the day time as there are some areas that can be sketchy at night, but for the most part, a great community with many eclectic shops.  My 16 year old loves shopping in this neighborhood.",Pilsen,July 2015,50

Great Walking Neighborhood,Terry M,"You can find great deals on second hand furniture, new and repurposed furniture in this neighborhood.  I needed a few items for my new apartment and the first Saturday I went looking found everything.  I walked into one shop and didn't find anything but asked about other shops in the area that might carry the items.  The owner wrote down some shop names for me and off I went.

"Great visit, amazing exhibit",aup231,"We went to see the Virgil Abloh collection at the MCA and were impressed by the setup and the museum.  The permanent collection was a great short visit but the Virgil Abloh design collection told the story of this exceptional architect-turned-fashion designer.  It was interesting to our son who has a penchant for Off-White brand clothing but it was also interesting to my wife and I for the story it told about what Abloh used as inspiration for art in the form of clothing.  Also, some of the displays transcend beyond clothing and you can see where his architecture training has led him.  Overall, a surprise that I enjoyed this exhibit so much.",Museum of Contemporary Art,July 2019,40
The Virgil Abloh Exhibit ,dkrope,"I walked in with my 15 year old daughter not knowing anything about Mr. Abloh.

Most are quite clean. If you don’t feel it is, walk out and find another. I’ve never gotten sick in China Town. Use the same common sense you would anywhere. Stroll into a few shops for fun.

Super fun for a few hours! ,Hillbillybean,"My husband and I walked the main streets of Chinatown and had a blast trying new foods in the little bakeries and restaurants. We stopped at different places to try Dim Sum, a smoothie with tapioca balls, Chinese baked goods, 1/4 duck, and beef satay. There are lots of stores with little souvenirs, plants, dishes, artistic pots, cookware, cool pocket knives and swords, etc. The Chinese grocery stores were super interesting with lots of dried foods and fish. Many restaurants validate parking, but don’t go over 3 hours or you’ll have to pay full price. ($15). ",Chicago Chinatown,May 2019,50

Landed at Midway and used CTA to get around ,sixpakabz1,I live in NYC but I was impressed with the CTA. It’s east to navigate and I felt safe. I noticed how clean the rail system is and I liked that it was all above ground. The CTA employees were so helpful without asking their assistance. I thought the cost of riding the rail is fair. I took the red line to Wrigley Field which was so convenient. I was especially happy that I didn’t have to rent a car. ,Chicago Transit Authority - CTA,July 2019,40
Good Extensive and Inexpensive System,LA1256,"Like most US city systems, the CTA is extensive and easy to use, once you quickly get used to it.   Get a Ventra card and load cash or day pass on it or just buy tickets as you go.   The Subway system works like all others and is easy to navigate - once you're used to the American practice of giving the same name to different stations miles apart on the same street!   The buses are good too and more interesting as you see the streets as you travel.   System felt safe too.",Chicago Transit Authority - CTA,July 2019,50

Envious of CTA system and wish my city had public transportation like this...,Carolyn R,"My family visited Chicago in July, and did not use a rental car. We took the CTA from the airport to our hotel (easy-easy).  Ticket machines were easy to use once you read thru the directions a couple times and figured out whether a pass or day to day tickets were most economical option.  When we weren't walking around the city, we took the train around. We visited Wrigley Field and a few more sites.  We also used it to return to the airport.  We consulted with the hotel concierge as to whether the El or using Uber better option (we had lots of bags).  They recommended train. Not only is it cheaper but faster. We got on at a station in the River North section of the city. It was crowded (and awkward as we had lots of bags). But as each stop got closer to the airport. the train became less crowded and again can I just say so fast.  We could see the freeway from the train and it was gridlock.  We made it to O'Hare with lots of time to spare.  I would plan to just use CTA for my next trip to Chicago. It was easy, cheap and fun.",Chicago Transit Authority - CTA,July 2019,40

"The Dusable Museum - Visited Sun, Apr 8, 2018",Rokesly,"We took a local bus from our hotel area (Magnificent Mile) and it was a straight ride that lasted roughly about 45 minutes. We were happy as it gave us a chance to visit another area - the “Southside” of Chicago and we loved looking at the many beautiful and in some cases majestic homes we saw along MLK Blvd (like some of those found in Harlem and Brooklyn Heights, NY). I had purchased a Go City Chicago card – unfortunately the Museum was not on the eligible listed attractions but it was still a “must see” for us from a support standpoint and certainly worth visiting. It is a small museum and we paid $10 total for entrance. We arrived after walking through and crossing the Washington park area where the bus dropped us off (Note: There is a bus that stops in front of the museum – but we weren’t on that one!). We started our tour in the lower area and saw many artifacts including shackles, documents, items of clothing, etc. and listened to the video screenings narrate the historical path of African Americans and the Transatlantic Slave Trade – ending with the election of President Barack Obama. I was particularly alarmed when I saw a photograph of a man and woman in full Klu Klux Klan garb holding the hand of a young child – it’s an image I don’t think I’ll soon forget for many reasons. I loved the Fabiola Jean-Louis “Rewriting History” display of beautiful paper gowns and photography. It is a portrayal of the artistic vision of the resilience, strength, hope and beauty of Blacks. I visited The Trading Post gift shop and chatted with the very nice and helpful saleslady there (forgot her name) – having purchased some lovely items as presents for friends and family. There weren’t too many visitors when we went (early afternoon) I was told they get a steady influx of groups (from churches, etc.) and also especially during Black History month. Note that some areas of the museum were closed to visitors as the Curatorial team is working on incoming exhibits. I am very glad we concluded our Chicago trip with a visit to the DuSable Museum.",DuSable Museum of African American History,April 2018,40

Major Awesome!,John H,"45,000 not 450,000 runners but there were an estimated 1.7 million spectators too.  It was a perfect weather day.  The course map took the runner through 20 or so distinct neighborhoods of Chicago, although missing the three stadiums by mere blocks in every case.  The Chicago Transit Authority trains (the ""L"") were awesome as well, ushering spectators to various points along the course, making it possible for this writer at least to cheer on his runners at six different points along the course.  Security was present and visible, with many precautions in place, but generally unobtrusive, except at the finish line where runners and their fans were separated so dramatically that almost no one was able to see their runners finish and most had to wait 30 minutes or more for them to wend their way through the post-race runner village.  All in all a highly recommended experience, and one final note - the official marathon app was amazing with interactive maps, runner tracking, and tons of information.",Chicago Marathon,October 2016,50
Huge event!,jaymeb77,"Very well managed event for having so many people.  The spectators were great. Everyone was friendly.  As with any run, more port-a-potties would always be a plus.  Names on bibs would be fantastic.",Chicago Marathon,October 2016,40

A Real Chagall in Chicago,Orangecar,I had heard that there was a 4-panel Chagall Mosaic in Chicago near the Private Bank theatre. Our family went to the mosaic thinking it was a reproduction of a museum piece. You could imagine how surprised we were when we realized the piece was an original! The mosaic itself has tells stories both domestic and religious and captures moments in life. The work is on the abstract side and may not appeal to everyone. But if you are near the mosaic spending a few minutes with this interesting piece of art will certainly brighten your day.,Chagall's Four Seasons,August 2017,40

The marathon runs right through the neighborhood which was very convenient.  The crowd was super energetic and supportive of the marathoners. There were so many spectators it was really hard to see our family runner in the course.  Restaurants here were very family friendly and accommodating to our group of 8.  We didn't have to wait at all for a table either night. Harrison Park was a great place for our kids to run around and blow off steam after a long car ride.

Waste of Time,michaelbZ494,"Not worth your time or admission fee. Barely anything in the building passes for art, the exhibitions are populated with very few exhibits.

Lots to do and see,ricomatt,"We took the river taxi from Clarke Street for the scenic 15 minute ride to Chicago's Chinatown. Departing the boat we walked the 10 minutes to the entrance of a plaza filled with restaurants selling dim sum, noodles, bbq, and bubble tea. We stopped into Qing Xiang Yuan Dumplings and put our name on the list - they told us they would text us in about 2 hours when our table for 5 was ready. From there we wandered through the plaza then looped back around to the gate demarking the main street of Chinatown. We stopped into a wonderful bakery (there are dozens of them) and had BBQ pork buns, bean paste moon pies, and other pastries to tide us over until dinner. It was a wonderful afternoon. Make sure to grab some beer or wine since QXYD is BYOB. We missed out on that one since the only nearby package store closed at 7:30 PM, just moments before we realized that the restaurant was BYOB. Qing Xiang Yuan Dumplings was AMAZING.",Chicago Chinatown,September 2019,50
Interesting,HDS1,"My son and I walked through Chinatown when I visited him recently.  It was amazing to see the huge variety of stores and restaurants, and a little overwhelming.

For 2 guys from a much smaller town in Iowa, driving around Chicago was not going to be an option. I recommend buying a Ventra card ($5 and refunded as transit value if you register your card online) and add a pass for the length of your trip. We used the Google Maps app to figure out how to get around. Ventra also has an app to track their transit vehicles, but I don't think it can help plan a route. It would help if the signs at the bus stops had the name of the stop, but most of them are at intersections, so just look for the cross street and you should be good.",Chicago Transit Authority - CTA,September 2019,40

Hours are very limited and they are closed on Sunday and Monday.  We arrived straight from the airport and they gladly stored our bags.  Jeanine is a wealth of information as was our guide.  Give yourself plenty of time to see the back room before taking the tour upstairs.  Yes upstairs where they had to drag the equipment to record.  Knowing that we stood where musical royalty laid down some of the best tracks ever just gives you chills.  We've been to Sun and Stax but somehow this place stands out as more important.

The young gentleman who guided us knew tons of info about the workings of Chess Records, and the individuals who participated. It was a truly humbling experience to stand in the room where Chuck Berry recorded the bulk of his catalog, where the Stones recorded (3 times), where Willie Dixon, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, etc., etc., worked and played, and where Etta James sang ""At Last"".

(It is just an assumption, they were homeless and I could be wrong.)

A MUST for any serious runner,JasonMcfly,"When I first moved to Chicago 7 years ago, I wasn’t a runner, but I thought it was odd everyone went out and cheered on the runners. It started to become a tradition for myself and my friends. After the Boston bombing, things take on a whole new meaning watching the runners. Last year I decided I wanted to run it, so I joined a running team and trained my butt off all summer. I didn’t get in the lottery but ran for a charity which was cool. Running the Chicago Marathon is simply amazing! 45,000 runners but almost 2 MILLION spectators lining the course from the start to finish!

Multifaceted exhibits of African-American History,Djah2,"I believe that this museum was developed by volunteers who gathered money, information and historical artifacts as they could from the 50s onward until they got a building to display their lives, their suffering, their courage and dignity. It is very moving, and especially the art of Margaret Burroughs and the political achievements of Mayor Harold Washington.

An educational resource for African American history and culture,Taylor B,"The DuSable Museum of African American History is dedicated to study and conservation of African American history, culture and art. It has become an educational resource and a focal point in Chicago for black social activism. Located at 740 East 56th Place, at the corner of Cottage Grove Avenue, in Washington Park, on Chicago's South Side, the museum was founded in 1961 by Dr. Margaret Taylor-Burroughs to correct the perceived omission of black history and culture in the education establishment. It was originally located on the ground floor of the Burroughs' home at 3806 South Michigan Avenue, renamed for Jean Baptiste Point du Sable and the first non-Native American permanent settler in Chicago in 1968, then finally moved to its current location in 1973. The museum's model has been emulated in numerous other cities around the country, including Boston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. In 2004, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is the oldest and before the founding of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC the largest caretaker of African American culture in the United States. In 2016, it formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. Highlights of the museum's collection include memorabilia, personal effects and recollections of the political career of Chicago's late Mayor Harold Washington, the desk of activist Ida B. Wells, the violin of poet Paul Laurence Dunbar and the Charles Dawson Papers. The museum has a collection of 13,000 artifacts, books, photographs, art objects and memorabilia. It has United States slavery-era relics, 19th and 20th century artifacts, works by scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, poet Langston Hughes and sociologist St. Clair Drake. The museum, which contains 50,000 square feet of exhibition space, a gift shop, a research library and a 466-seat auditorium, also displays African American art by South Side Community Art Center students Charles White, Archibald Motley Jr., Gus Nall, Charles Sebree and Marion Perkins and prints and drawings by Henry O.

Birthday Fun Day,aliciamE3403FL,"My friend and I were celebrating our birthdays which are a day apart. We had lunch and went to the museum afterwards so early afternoon with no crowds. I hadn’t been in years and it is even more beautiful than I remembered. There were various exhibits but I felt all were thought provoking and really stirred my heart. We had time to linger, take in, discuss, laugh, shed a few tears, get angry, was pleasantly surprised, had a few “aha” moments with deep reflections on our ride to meet a friend afterwards. I recommend checking it out and, as much as possible, prepare your heart and mind to be open to each exhibit, painting, emotions and reflection that is sure to come no matter what your point of view currently is.

Ohio Street beach visit,387speterson,"It's a delightful little beach, filled with families as well as triathlon trainees. I was able to swim laps alongside the athletes. The only problem was lack of proper bathroom. The Port-a-Potties were absolutely filthy. At least the (dirty) Handicap Port-a-Potty was large enough I was able to change clothes.

Part of Chicago's Architectural History,William W,"When it was first built, I am sure it was a modern concept with a residential building being self sufficient with everything people would need.

"A unique, quirky, shop local, small town feel in Chicago.",Dorene M,"Reading the reviews, I totally disagree with those who say that Andersonville is not worth a visit if you're from out of town or that it is just a mediocre place to visit. Now, some reviewers seemed to expect to be in Stockholm and hear mass quantities of Swedish while strolling down the streets. Andersonville was a Swedish neighborhood when this area was considered the suburbs way back when. The Swedes settled in Andersonville after the Great Chicago Fire, and eventually did move to the burbs after the Great Depression. Is it the most interesting part of the world? Perhaps not, but it's retro, quirky feel and local and proud stores make a visit totally worthwhile. It is a huge draw for the LGBTQ community, both to dine and shop, as well as to call home. The cafes, bars, stores, ice cream and gelato shops, candy shop, restaurants, art galleries, vintage shops and such are unique, to say the least. Andersonville has tried to avoid chain retailers, which, for the most part it has. If the chains of suburbia don't appeal to you, the unique charm of Andersonville certainly will! It's easy to get to Andersonville via the L or a number of CTA busses. Shoes? Crystals and minerals? Cocktails? Vintage finds? Hand made ice cream? Comic books? Lunch or dinner? Farmers market?

You may want to check on this situation before visiting.  I enjoyed this museum.  It is contemporary so it is best to visit without preconceived ideas of what to expect. Due to construction, the museum can be experienced in about 90 mins dependent on how much you become involved with the displays and the do-it-yourself activities.  Many of the current pieces would be difficult for children to experience.  The children we saw at the Museum appeared quite bored.  I would recommend the experience as it  takes you on a unique journey of alternative mediums and presentations of the art world.  Keep an open mind.

Worth a visit if you want to see the trends in contemporary art,Snarth,"This museum had some interesting items in it and some that were, well, less than. That's probably true of any contemporary art museum since the pieces have not had time to develop ""sticking power,"" as it were. There were some very nice Rauschenberg pieces and some appealing items from lesser known/ younger artists. One thing that annoyed me was the cacophonous and sometimes competing sounds emanating from some of the works.

You can buy tickets for single rides ($3 for most rides, $5 from O'Hare) and get downtown in around 40 minutes.

An early modern building in the heart of Chicago, its round towers seem a bit dated in a city now filled with more contemporary skyscrapers.

This is hallowed ground for followers of the music. The fully guided tour takes you through the original studio sets, with clips of some of the famos recordings made there. From the Rolling Stones iconic track ""2120 South Michigan Avenue"", which ended up as an instrumental, to the haunting Etta James ""At Last"", played out as you gaze at the actual microphone and stand used during the recording.

Cute park!,Bdizzel16,"I was born in Chicago and lived there many years and never knew about Oz Park till now.

Overall great,M.j. J,"Overall the Chicago marathon was great.  Excellent aid stations, porta potties the whole route, great services right after the finish & ability for a quick exit from the park after the finish. The only reason I am not giving a 5 star review was the security experience prior to the race. Gate 6 was misinformed & would not let runners into the start with beverages. They made everyone throw out beverages & told us there were water bottles inside, there were not. No other entry gate did this so it was clearly a training issue for those working gate 6. ",Chicago Marathon,October 2018,40
Great Experience but Requires Navigational Planning!!!,kevinv877,"Who would have thought watching a family member run in the Chicago marathon could be so difficult!!  We downloaded the tracking app and thought, we'll just show up at some mile markers and wait for her to run by...  Of course, we totally underestimated the difficulty in getting from point A to point B while the race was ongoing. There is no ubers available and simply walking is made difficult be the many, many barricades on sidewalks,etc.  Since there is a constant stream of thousands of runners all along the course, crossing over is extremely difficult in itself. The only way to get around is the EL, which was so crowded that a sardine can would have been an improvement. Anyhow, we persevered and got to see at least some of this magnificent marathon!!",Chicago Marathon,October 2018,40
They call it windy city for a reason!,ozal u,"2018, Oct - when we started, it was foggy and cloudy. But the wind was hard when we ran nearby the shore. However; the race was good and the spectators also good! ",Chicago Marathon,October 2018,50
Marathon Spectator Helpful Hints,Suzan J,"1) Make room reservations as much in advance as possible, hotels near starting, finish lines, and mile markers along  route fill up very fast 2) If you want to see your ""runner"" at different mile markers,  study route and browse for hotels  nearby more than one marker. 3) If you don't plan ahead, you will NOT be able to cross streets 4) Do NOT expect to find a taxi, or ride-share between 7:00 AM and noon (anywhere downtown) 5) Wear running shoes or comfortable walking shoes, as you will be covering a lot of distance as a spectator (unless you want to wait in one place for over 4 hours); some spectators prefer to take the red line or other trains, but a few people I spoke with were even more confused using public transport  6) Chicago weather can vary greatly.  Bring layers, warm hats (preferable a beanie type that will not blow off, as many caps so; also a windbreaker/waterproof or plastic poncho), gloves and even foot and hand warmers! One woman I spoke with did not wear gloves and her fingers were so cold she couldn't even push the keys on her mobile phone! 7) carry water or your favorite nonalcoholic beverage and snacks with you as the excitement of the race will have you dehydrated after the race even if you just stand still 8) All backpacks, purses, bags of any kind are checked by security and metal detectors check every spectator before they can get any where near the meet up zone 9) If you are flying in for the event, best to fly after 6:00 PM as traffic is very heavy.

"Well planned by B of A & Chicago, and our planning was pretty good",Allen21096,"So you want to attend the Chicago Marathon?  We wanted to attend, because my son was running it for the first time and his friend was on his 6th.  First, the course is planned out pretty well and it appears that most everything has been thought of.  There are port-a-potties everywhere.  There is unlimited space for viewing.  And, Bank of America has put together a phone app that was extraordinary.  Besides giving plenty of information about times to be there and places to be, it has an exceptional tracking section.  We were able to monitor their progress throughout.  We found that of the four places that we watched, the app was only off by a half of block on just one of those viewing opportunities.  So, seven of us started out to find viewing places and the night before we plotted out a course of action, with a ""Plan B:""  The first thing that is important to realize is that you can not drive through the course, so in order to get to different viewing areas, you have to drive on the surface street on the outskirts of the course.  We were advised to use Uber or the ""El"", but once we started we realized that those two modes weren't going to work well.  The thing to remember is that there are a lot of runners, so you have a choice - to sit at one spot and watch tens of thousands of runners go by, or to pick out a couple of spots and work your way around to them, while monitoring the tracking app, to see your specific runners.  So, we headed for Addison St. and Broadway Ave., first.  We found a spot to park and decided to leave one person with the car.  There really is an ebb and flow among the spectators, so what is a crowded spot may not be for long.  Our second spot was Adams St. and Ashland Ave., at M.M. 15.  At this second spot, we were only able to view my son, as his friend had worked his way ahead.  Again, we parked less than a block away and someone stayed with the car.  Our 3rd choice was at Canalport and Cermak Rd.  At this area, the neighborhood was a bit more desolate,.  When we parked the car, we were very close and all of us were able to catch my son, as he went by.  This was the one spot that the tracking off was a bit off.  The final viewing area was the spectator area at the finish line at Roosevelt Rd. and Michigan Ave.  We weren't able to park as close, but most of us did get to see my son as he came past the spectator area.  The starting area is not a good spot to see your runner, there are far too many people. - in 2019, a mere 45,786 participants!  With our planning, we were able to view my son running at four different spots.  My grandkids loved to watch their Dad and uncle and the three of them had different signs that they had made the night before.  It was a fun day.  And the weather was nice.  It never rained, it was not hot and muggy and it was a comfortable day for running.  All in all, a lot of fun,",Chicago Marathon,October 2019,50

An upended cuboid, a tiered art deco ziggurat, or these days, a symphony of steel and glass. But what you don't see many of is concrete cylinders. The structure is slightly more complex than that, with the cross-section resembling a flower. Architect Bertrand Goldberg was at the forefront of development in 1959 with these two towers being the first residential high-rise blocks built in Chicago since the war. His vision has since been emulated many times. One reason I love these buildings is that they are an antidote to the shiny reflectivity seen on so many skyscrapers, and have more of an organic feel than anything else in the city.",Marina City,August 2012,50

Marc Chagall makes his mark in Chicago,Taylor B,"Located in an unlikely and totally unexpected place, the Chase Tower Plaza, at 10 South Dearborn Street, The Four Seasons by Russian-French artist Marc Chagall is a series of mosaics that lyrically and colorfully celebrate the arrival of spring, summer, fall and winter. A gift to the City of Chicago by Frederick H. Prince of the Prince Charitable Trust, it is wrapped around four sides of a 70-feet-long, 14-feet-high and 10-feet-wide rectangular box. It was dedicated on September 27, 1974 and renovated in 1994 when the mosaic panels were restored and a protective canopy was installed. Best known as a painter, Chagall also produced ceramics, stained glass and mosaics. The Four Seasons represent human life, both physical and spiritual, at its different stages. The mosaic features 128 separate panels and 250 different colors, joined together with additional glass and stone fragments. Imagery includes birds, fish, flowers suns and lovers, all references to memories of simple, village life, interspersed with sunbursts and city skylines. Chagall also is well-known in Chicago for his America Windows, a series of large-scale stained-glass panels that were installed in the Art Institute of Chicago in 1977.",Chagall's Four Seasons,April 2019,50

We got $10 off the entry fee through GoldStar - the entrance fee is just too pricey and paid $20 for parking by the Adler Planetarium. Taking public transport would be my advice if you can.  There's a cafe with food that is actually good and since there's nothing else in the area, that was appreciated.  We were there for 3 hours and it was most informative.  Only complaint was that sometimes the music that is playing in every room was distracting from trying to also hear the audio.  Very creative displays that make a complex and important time in US history more understandable.",Hamilton: The Exhibition,May 2019,40

Ugh - what must visitors think?,Mari M,"I've seen many a performance at the Auditorium Theatre and am always disappointed with the condition of the place. The amount of peeling paint and the general feeling of unkemptness is cringeworthy.  Just a thought, isn't peeling paint a code violation? Lack of female toilets - hey how's this for an idea, make what little p.c's you have, unisex - and lack of staff to man the snack/drink booth, makes for a rushed and unenjoyable intermission.",Auditorium Theatre,December 2017,10

The stairs up to the second floor are unique, stadium style for sitting and walking feels expansive and modern in the middle of all that marble!  It's a nice place for a quick bite, but they could use more coffee options.  Great place for design ideas (or fantasies for more of us), but don't think your're going to go shopping, or you'll likely be disappointed.  Still worth the trip to this iconic building.",Merchandise Mart,March 2017,40
Boystown - friendly and fun!,neil c,Probably one of the best gay villages in the US.  Fun friendly bars and restaurants all located close to each other.

I thought, hey, that looks like what picasso would do with a statue, and what do you know! it IS a picasso statue. Very neat to be able to get up close and see all the different angles.

When approached to design this monumental work, he gave it to the people of Chicago as a gift.

Twisted Dickens with 2nd City!,John B,"A healthy dose of Dickens and A Christmas Carol, plus challenging improv (e.g., a chracter that, per audience input, speaks only in prime numbers) from the Second City Troup made for a hilarious evening that showed the descendants of SNL's founders hold their own and more.

A Christmas Carol at the Goodman - dissapointed,swb127,"We saw ""A Christmas Carol"" about 5 years ago at the Goodman Theatre and absolutely loved it!  This time around was a whole different experience.  While Larry Yando did an excellent job of playing Scrooge, and there were some added special effects, there were many things that didn't sit right.  Why did they change the story and have a niece instead of a nephew?  This is a classic, seems strange to change the story.  Also, because it is set in the 1800's, and again because it is a classic, it was odd to have Bob Cratchit's family be multi-cultural.  I love multi-cuture generally (and am myself a product of such), but it was confusing to have the Cratchit family represented this way.  It was also confusing to have such a limited cast that the same person played different parts in the past, the present and the future - without changing them enough to look different!  I love this play, but do not see myself returning to the Goodman unless I they make some significant changes to the script and directing.",Goodman Theatre,December 2016,20

A small gift shop at the entrance and an area with tables where several families had brought snacks and lunch for them and their kids.  We found a parking place on the street across from the entrance.  We spent 2 hrs and felt we had seen it all.

Nice to see kids playing on the base of the statue and parents siting there - of course this makes photography difficult. Very interesting piece when viewed from different angles, so I did the 'art viewing' walk and looked at it from all sides. Even from the top of a bus tour.",Picasso Statue,July 2017,50
Lovely example of a bygone age,prairiewheat,My preferred seating is the center of the first few rows on the 1st balcony.  From that spot you are still close enough to the stage and the view is less obstructed than on the main floor.,Auditorium Theatre,May 2013,50
It's hot and the lines move at a snails pace,BeachnSnowTraveler,"Nice looking, classic theater.  But it's hot. Drinks are expensive and lines move at a snails pace. Go early or go satiated.",Auditorium Theatre,May 2013,30
Architectural Masterpiece,Jonathan19851,"I've seen shows here several years ago.  I remember them being excellent as far as acoustics and view.  But, even if you are not going for a show, you should just walk to the building to look at it.  This was, and still is, one of the most important buildings in Chicago.  While the southern portion was lost when Congress Parkway was widened in the 1950s, there is still a lot to admire.  I've always been able to walk in freely to the portion that is run by Roosevelt University.  While some of it is not original, there is still a lot to see.  A trip up the stairs shows off some of the original glasswork.  The lobby is also fairly intact.  When you get to the top floor, which is now a library, you can get an idea of what the space used to look like.  There is still carved wood paneling on the columns.  If you actually do get a chance to see a show here (something I highly recommend for the atmosphere alone) really take the time to look at your surroundings.  This building was one of the first in the world with electricity, and is arguably the first with air conditioning.  There is a lot of history here, and its really something you should not miss.  ",Auditorium Theatre,August 2012,50
Great Venue,troschne,Beautiful theatre! Great acoustics! I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is thinking about attending a performance there. I look forward to going back for another one!,Auditorium Theatre,September 2013,50
Classic Landmark Chicago Theater,mkoChicago,"Good acoustics and view. Avoid upper balcony. There is no assistance to help you find your seat, very narrow aisles, and it's hot. I still recommend this theater as a great venue for musicals or concerts!",Auditorium Theatre,October 2013,40
Chicago's Icon -- And No Secret What It Is,Rick628,"Chicago was more than a trifle bewildered when the Picasso statue was unveiled, but over the years it has come to be a Chicago Icon, like the opera house in Sydney or the Arch in St. Louis.  Lots of folks think that what the statue depicts is a mystery (I suppose that's part of its charm), but just Google ""Picasso's Afgan Hound"", look at the images, and ta-da! mystery solved.  Always worth a visit both to see the statue and to people-watch the other visitors in the plaza.",Picasso Statue,October 2017,50
Great public art!,algebraqueen,"When in Chicago, you must see this amazing work by Picasso, It is surprising to learn that he did not wish to give it a title, preferring people to identify it as they wish. When we were there, small children were playing on it, clearly comfortable with its shape and form!",Picasso Statue,October 2017,50
Ferris wheel,Loyd P,This one of those things you do once so you can say you did.  Glad we did it but wouldn't spend the money again. Good view of Chicago and lake but not special enough to do again.,Centennial Wheel,August 2017,40
Too Sterile ,ajchavo,"The pod they put you in take away from the experience of being on a ferris wheel and being up that high. It's enclosed and air conditioned. There's a tv monitor in there in case anyone's attention span is incredibly short. The pods don't move at all and it's absolutely silent in there. Close your eyes and you'd never know you were moving or going up in height. I'm glad we did it just to say we did it. I've lived in the area for 15 yrs. now and this is 100% a tourist trap. The price for this ride is ok and understandable considering what it takes to run this sort of thing. Out of towners may consider it pricey considering its ""just a ferris wheel"". It is a great view, though.",Centennial Wheel,August 2017,30
Nice Ride But......,769jimt,"$15 per person was a bit steep for 2 spins around the wheel. Views of Chicago were, however, very good. Make sure it is a clear day before you go. All in all it was a goid experience.",Centennial Wheel,August 2017,40
"A great museum, perfect for my 6 year old boys",TexasGingerbread,"This was a great hands-on nature museum.  The butterfly house was fabulous and every single room has hands on experiences.  I would highly recommend this museum for any toddlers and up.  I visited because it was part of the ASTC passport program and boy was I surprised.  I went with decent expectations, but it by far exceeded them.  You can easily spend 3 hours.  Only vending machine on site, but there is a room with tables you can eat at.  The people that work there will bring out live animals if you ask.",The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,January 2015,50

"Nice, small family museum.",lchicagolaw,"Do not plan on spending a whole day here, but there is enough to see for a couple hours if you visit every exhibit.  Mostly this is a museum for families with young children.  The butterfly garden is the real draw here, especially on a cold, crummy (typical) Chicago day.  It's always warm and sunny in the butterfly garden (and so many beautiful, friendly butterflies--expect them to land right on you).",The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,December 2014,30
Great Place for Kids (including toddlers),MickeyJay,"I was there with my 19 month old during a school break. However, that didn't prevent her from having a great time over the course of 2 1/2 hours. Most of the exhibits appear designed for a slightly older crowd, but there was more than enough to keep my child interested and happy. You can bring a snack or lunch, which I recommend since the food available for purchase is quite limited. The staff was very good.",The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,April 2015,40
Twist Your Dickens,Kathy A,"The theater is very nice, employees are helpful and seating is comfortable.  We went to see Twist Your Dickens.  It was somewhat funny...not as much improv as I was expecting.  The best part was when they read the audiences naughty ""deeds"" they had done to others.  Most of the show was 6th-grade-boys humor at best.  The second half did pick up a bit with the Land of the Lost Toys and Hipsters (wish they would've done more of this) and the scenes with Tiny Tim's friends and family.  I found myself, my husband and 16-year-old daughter laughing more when the most of the audience was not laughing as much.  A lot of the audience laughed a things I did not find funny & some people seemed to laugh at EVERYthing...guess we all have a very different sense of humor.",Goodman Theatre,December 2015,40

Picasso and Free Wi-Fi,Muriel M,"The Picasso statue is an interesting walk-by.  There's also a Miro on the opposite side of the street and a fountain with improbably Tidy-Bowl blue water spouting merrily in the same plaza.  All in all the area is friendly, open and culturally important.  I like the ""free wi-fi"" box at the base of the Picasso statue.  That keeps it in perspective as part of the Chicago urban scene, not a cultural icon.",Picasso Statue,October 2017,40
"Worth Seeing, but Doesn't Need More Than a Few Minutes",Scribbles4,"We saw this from a bus window and with the exception of not being able to take any pictures, that was just about all the time we needed to devote to it.  Again, with many things this weekend, it would have been best to see it in warmer weather.",Picasso Statue,October 2017,40
Harly worth it,Larry S,"Now let's talk about the stadium itself.  It is an architectural monstrosity.  It supposedly is a mix of the new and old memorial soldier arches.  Much of the new doesn't look that new and the mix is hideous.  I sat in the 400 section, which is the upper tier of the west side.  Attaining the tier is not a problem- you can walk up a long ramp or use the lower level and then stairs.  I guess the designer did not consider that modern stadiums have elevators and escalators.  Or maybe, the Chicago Park District, the stadium owners, just didn't want to spend the money.  Hopefully your seat in the 400 section is near the bottom.  Otherwise you will have a long stair climb to your fortieth row seat.  I watched old people and people with kids struggle up those stairs.  I ordered a $9.00 hot dog.  I thank the cook for loading up with stuff as the dog was awful.  The soggy bun came apart as soon as I touched it.  If you want Coke or Pepsi, forget it.  This is an RC Cola and Seven-up stadium.  I needed to go to the bathroom during the game.  I held it long as I could.  You see there are no bathrooms on the 400 level.  First you climb down all those stairs previously mentioned.  Then you climb down stairs to the lower level.  Maybe it didn't occur to the architect that 20,000 people sitting on that level might want to use the washroom.  By the way, you will also go down the steps to buy food or drink- there are no vendors in the seating area.  Bears ticket prices are ridiculous as well as food and drink prices.  Why did I go?  Only because I scored a cheap ticket from a third party site.  But I never do this more than once a year because it is a fairly miserable experience, made worse by how bad the Bears have been in recent years.  I do not recommend this unless you are seriously rabid Bears fan.",Soldier Field,August 2018,10
Flying saucer meets columns,joe-chicago-23,The views and sight lines inside the stadium are actually very good. Large video screens above both end zones are very helpful.,Soldier Field,August 2018,30

Great museum. Definitely recommend for children.,brandip950,Excellent museum experience. Allow several hours (3-4) to thoroughly explore everything. We rushed through in 2.5 so we could get to the zoo and didn't get to experience everything. A good mix of activities for all age ranges. Both my 4 year old and 10 year old really enjoyed the museum. The butterflies were a big hit. ,The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,May 2015,40
Not worth the money,Anne_Chicago_16,I guess point of clarification is in order - I don't think paying $50 for a family of 4 to see some butterflies flying around is worth it. Frankly had thought the museum would be more than just some stuffed polar bears and wolves. Just underwhelmed. Not really for small children. Other than the butterflies - those were beautiful.,The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,July 2015,20
Very Special,Dynamicjohn,My fiancé planned this and little did I know how amazing it would be. The acting was fantastic and the sets were amazing.

Must See Beautiful Theatre,Kim D,We enjoyed Tango Buenos Aires at this 125 year old theatre.  It is very beautiful with ornate and elaborate architecture from it's time.  The seating provides ample leg room and all seats appear to have unobstructed views of the stage.  A must see even if you don't enjoy a performance at this iconic theatre.,Auditorium Theatre,January 2015,50
Great theater,chriscentralIllinois,"Went there to see the Joffre Ballet.  Great theater except for our seats.  We had side balcony seats and the view is not good unless you have front row seats.  The balistrides for the rail dividing the boxes rise about 6 inches over the rail and it will block your view of the stage.  Worse after the first intermission a guy about 6' 4"" sat in the first row of blocking about 2/3rds of the stage from my wife and I's view.  They let us move to better seats so we were lucky.  However, the other guy in our row had to spend the rest of the show standing up to see the stage.  Other than that we had a great time.  Would definately go back just will pick better seats.",Auditorium Theatre,February 2015,40

Overall this staff was amazing and we would definitely go back!",Soldier Field,September 2018,50
"Horrible, horrible flow of people in and out",Louis G,"This place is absolutely terrible to get in and out. I cannot believe a city the size of Chicago has such a disgrace of a field as far as the access. Way in is a woesome lack of security folks causing a backup. On the way out, I was being pushed and two people fell on me as they tripped on curbs that were impossible to see, not to mention unpainted - should have been yellow. Plants and bushes were being trampled over as people tried to get through as the sections of the exit bottlenecked. My friend was about to have a panic attack so we eventually hopped a fence and found a perch near the Field Museum to watch all the people walking by. After it finally passed, we were able to walk out in a more sensible fashion. View from out seats and the game itself was great, but I will never attend another event here unless they greatly improve the flow of people.",Soldier Field,September 2018,10

Closed Despite Website Advertisement of Open Year Round,mssoellegant,I traveled to Chicago from KY the weekend of 12/8/17. I purchased combo tickets directly on navypier.org for the Centennial Wheel & Art Institute. However upon arriving to the Centennial Wheel there was not an operator or patron in sight despite it being 2pm on a Saturday or the website saying the wheel is open year round. That is why this attraction is getting 1 star. Unfortunately tickets are non refundable so I am not happy I wasted my money.,Centennial Wheel,December 2017,10

Fantastic Stadium!,mol8008,We were in Chicago for a long weekend and were able to get tickets to the Bears vs. Buccaneers game.  It was a great game.  We took an Uber and got as close to the stadium and we could and followed the crowd in.  We got there in plenty of time so we could check out the stadium before the game started.  The stadium itself is open and airy.  What I mean is the concourse where the food/beer vendors are is open so you don't feel like you're with thousands of people.  We never waited more than 4 or 5 minutes for a beer or food.  Our seats were great.  The crowd was fun and the Bears won!!!  it was a great day.  I'm glad we went.

Picasso’s Tragicomedy,Claude F,"I’ve seen it dozens of times, it always grabs my attention. It is public art at its best, it makes you think, and it is a thing of beauty and mystery.

The CTA does a good job getting people in and out.  The concessions are better than at most sports venues.  They have the same corporate swill as most, but there are a few independent vendors as well.  The beer selection is very poor in the age of craft beers.

The rival fans wore cheesy green and yellow outfits to support their losing cause.  On this day, the stadium was roaring with the sounds of rabid Bears fans as they saw their team bring Aaron Rodgers to his knees at least five times.  As my wise father told me when I was a young boy, “It’s always a great day when the Green Bay Packers lose.”  Amen.",Soldier Field,December 2018,40

Nice but warm,Etepay,We were here today in 100 degree heat. We agreed to go because it said it was air conditioned. Our cabin did not have working air and we were stuck in a hot glass box with 4 other people. The views were incredible but I think they need to check the cabins better.

Goodman's presents a Dickens masterpiece,928mtaz,"Came to Chicago at Christmas time to experince the nostalgia of a ""city christmas"" as I remembered from youth. Included in this was to see a traditional presentation of ""A Christmas Carol."" It was recommended by locals that Goodman would deliver. I was so glad that in fact we ventured out that evening. The experince was magical, as the cast was superior. They seemed to enjoy telling the story, perhaps even more than the audience themselves. The costumes and overall presentation was grand, all the while remaining true to the spirit of Dickens. True, it did have numerous ""fresh"" variations, but as a whole was delightful. I was pleased and felt the time here truly added to our holiday experience.",Goodman Theatre,December 2016,50

On a 90 degree day, the enclosed air conditioned booth you ride in is worth the $18 per person alone, even without the view (I’m joking!). You go around three full times and it is slow enough to get some great pictures. You don’t feel any sway, for those of you that get motion sick.  Room for 8 adults but you can sit with just the people (person) you came with.  No strangers are forced into your booth.  We’d accompany friends or family again without hesitation!",Centennial Wheel,August 2018,40
"Yes, size is important, but it's the view that will win the day...",jorigomez,"While waiting in line (a brief wait, because it was a weekday), my sister mentioned about how the Centennial is not quite as big as the wheel closer to where she resides (let's just say she lives by ""another fine touristy part of the USA"").  However, when she got on the Centennial Wheel, it was the view into downtown Chicago, Millenium Park and oh so beautiful Navy Pier straddling lovely Lake Michigan that took her breath away.  If you're coming to Navy Pier and you're not planning to get on the wheel, don't come, because you'll only kick yourself all the way home for not having done Centennial.  Yes, it's pricey, but I've never taken anybody up and afterwards thought ""gee, that was wasted money"" (and no, I'm not rich, but family fun is built on great outings).  Ultimately, you're not even paying for the view, you're paying for the lifelong memory of seeing such a beautiful city from a perspective that rivals if not outright surpasses that of what you get from Willis Tower (and yes, I love going up Willis Tower).  If you can plan it, do this on a weekday, because weekends are a much longer wait.  If you cannot avoid the weekend, you may save a good bit of time if you buy your electronic ticket online (just google for it, it's easy to find), which you can buy right when you're about to enter (it's a separate line to buy the tickets on-site). It's debatable whether or not it's worth it to buy the ""Fast Pass"" option.  Once you're on, it normally takes you around 3 good spins, so you don't feel like you've been taken for a ride (sorry, I couldn't resist the pun).",Centennial Wheel,August 2018,50

overpriced tourist trap,MelissaWP,"We took a trip on the wheel on a Saturday night.  Luckily, we pre-purchased tickets online, which saved us $2 on each ticket, but IMO this is still a way overpriced tourist attraction.  Nice view, but quick trip.  Each pod holds eight people and we were unfortunately stuck with a family of four across from us that included an unruly and obnoxious child that negatively impacted the trip and ambiance.  The best part of the trip was actually watching the videos on the monitors inside the pods showing how the wheel was built...very interesting.",Centennial Wheel,September 2018,30

A small boutique museum - easy with the kids,Allen21096,"We looked at going to a museum, but found that all of the regular ones on the museum campus by the Field Museum and even Museum of Science & Industry, seemed far too expensive.  We had never been to The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, so we gave it a try.  There is street parking, as well as a flat rate city parking lot that is close.  The prices are quite reasonable to get in.  It is a small museum that is easily managed with small children.  There is much to see for them, where they don't have to read anything.  We started at the 3rd floor, as the first floor was filled with school groups.  The 3rd floor has a birdwalk which is outside and overlooks the North Pond.  Since it was a little chilly, the birds were somewhere.  They have nice exhibit placards that include buttons to push for the bird calls.  The only problem is that only about 1/4 of the buttons were working.  We moved to the 2nd floor and we went in to the butterfly exhibit.  Though smaller than a conservatory, it was similar because of the plants.  There were a lot of varieties of butterflies that flew right past you or stopped on a branch or leaf in front of you.  It was fascinating to watch them and the kids certainly got a kick out of it.  They even did a butterfly release while we were there.  Over 75 species are represented with well over 1,000 butterflies.  There are nature walks through a variety of ecosystems with animals on display for the various locations, as well.  We came down to the first floor and went through the river works exhibit.  It was a little interesting but more than a couple of exhibits were definitely tired from the hundreds of school kids there on a daily basis.  Right next door there was a marshland exhibit, with live frogs, snakes and salamanders.  The staff is very personable and friendly with the kids.  You may not spend the entire day here, but that is good on those days when you just want to take the kids someplace that should interest them.",The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,October 2016,50
Great for kids!,482raquela,"The Nature Museum has a lot of attractives for children. My kids were really impressed by  the stuffed polar bear.

BTS Concert experience at Soldier Field was dreadful.,RetiredKYtraveler,"Taking our 12 year old girls to the BTS Concert at Soldier Field should have been well thought out in advance....they have been there for a while?

We chose our pick up place and left them for a wonderful time with their favorite group.  The concert was over at 10:30 pm and we could not use our pick up location....they decided we would be some place else.  We finally found the girls at midnight and as we were leaving the venue at 1:30 p.m., we passed many other kids and parents crying because they still had not found their kids.

Loved the Butterflies!,Mindy M,"This was our first visit to the Nature Museum. We had free admission from our local Science Museum through the reciprocity program. I took my 3-year-old and 6-year-old sons. My favorite part was the open butterfly area. We got to the Center about 15 minutes after they opened and we were in the butterfly area with only about 10 other people. I'm not sure if it is usually more crowded. We loved the stubborn adventurous turtle that kept escaping its area. We spent about an hour exploring the rest of the center. We could have spent a lot longer but my boys were eager to walk over to Lincoln Park Zoo (right across the street). My boys favorite part was the live animals and the 7 & under play area. We skipped the water play area because I didn't want the boys to get wet but they would have loved to play there. We also did eat lunch from the gift shop - chicken salad sandwiches, string cheese, and juice. It was reasonably priced and I preferred the food selections in comparison to other places that cater to hot dogs, burgers, popcorn, etc. Overall, I think the center is best suited for children. If you like the Field Museum's animal exhibits but don't like the crowds, this would b ea great alternative.",The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,February 2017,40
Something for all ages,matmul45,What a wonderful place to spend enjoy with the grandchildren.

By far the Butterfly exhibit was the best! Beautiful, colorful, large and small butterflies fluttering around you along with some birds; its quite a feeling. They'll even land on you! You almost expect Snow White to be singing in a corner! Parking is expensive at $20 for all day pass in the limited space lot across the street if you're just doing the museum tour but I recommend leaving plenty of time to walk across the street to the Lincoln Park Zoo, which is free...makes the parking charge worth it.

Chicago Christmas Tradition,rods114,"We headed to the Goodman not really know what it was, we saw it two blocks ahead and decided to investigate. The Goodman was showing their annual holiday classic, A Christmas Carol. We were able to get seats for the 2 o’clock show at 2 o’clock. Do not be mislead, there were four seats available and after seeing the production we were shocked that there were any. Apparently they have been doing this for decades and it appears they are keeping it fresh with nephew Fred being replaced by niece Freda and all characters being race neutral. They focus on what matters, good story, good acting and good performing. Scrooge was played by a local Chicago actor who better than any I have seen, live or the classic movie/remakes make Scrooge not angry and greedy, but as a product of hurt not just wonton greed or avarice. The theater is small and the subtle inflections and expressions were not lost and added to his effective portrayal. The sets were large and beautiful and had great details like the windows at Freda’s house having snow fall, but only in the windows. Great interpretations of the Ghost of Christmas Past , and Present. Stop reading this and go to it. You will not regret it and will regret you did not do it earlier when you finally do go.",Goodman Theatre,December 2017,50
Loved loved loved,funfam654321,We took a group of 40+ kids to see A Christmas Carol. They absolutely loved it. The theater is beautiful and the actors were amazing. Snacks and drinks were cheap enough and easy to get to. I hope to see many more shows here!,Goodman Theatre,December 2017,50
Christmas Carol,Sheila G,"If you’ve never been to the Goodman Theater (a true gem of a theater), go see Christmas Carol there. It’s an intimate theater and not a bad seat in the house. This was our second time seeing it and was just as good,  if not better, than the first time",Goodman Theatre,December 2017,50
Historically Beautiful!,VernazzaLover,"We attended an electronic music concert at the Auditorium Theatre.  Our original seats were in the balcony, but because of the laser show, they moved us to the main floor.  We sat under the ornate ceiling of frescos trimmed in gold.  I doubt there's a bad seat in this place.  ",Auditorium Theatre,May 2017,50
A Tour of Auditorium Theatre:  The very best tour I have ever been on!,awwmail,"If you are interested in architecture, theater, the history of Chicago--this has it all.  Nate, a most lively, knowledgeable guide, skillfully wove  the extraordinary role of this architectural masterpiece  in the re-creation of Chicago after the Great Fire and with the sometimes tragic lives of its creators:  Louis Sullivan, Dankman Adler and a very young Frank Lloyd Wright.  In its day, The Auditorium Theatre was the linchpin around which Chicago great culture revolved.  There is hardly a foot of space which is not decorated.  Even today, it features perfect acoustics, hundreds of thousands of hand laid -mosaic tile, brilliant iron work, gold leaf and murals, It was the  first public building ever to have electricity and even a form of early air conditioning).  Each member of the tour seemed memorized by the depth of knowledge along with the good humor of our guide. ",Auditorium Theatre,July 2017,50
Wonderful views!,Lindastravels76,This is an old and outstanding theatre.  The sound and light show were awesome.  I'd highly recommend this theatre.,Auditorium Theatre,June 2017,50
Public Art,grigolm,I like public art displayed in the streets and squares. This huge metal construction has big open space surrounding. Great place to people watch. Sometimes there is open market organized on that square.,Picasso Statue,October 2018,40
Quickly Visited,wolverine331,The statue is very Picasso and is nice to look at.  We didn't stop and stare at it for hours but just gave it a quick look while we were in the area.  Seeing art is always a fun stop and if in the area I recommend stopping to see it.,Picasso Statue,December 2018,50
"Is it a bird or a woman's head, or an alien?",WorldPartner,"The Picasso statue has been drawing stares and comments for over 50 years.  If you have an opportunity to see it up close, see what you think it is.",Picasso Statue,June 2018,50
Nice park if you have the time to visit,Psi1497,"We walked through and stopped for a brief visit during our Food Tour of Bucktown and Wicker Park. In the park there is a pretty fountain, basketball courts, a play ground and lots of shaded green spaces in which to relax. There is also a statue of the man responsible for the early origins of the park. Our guide, Christina, of Food Planet Food Tours, was very knowledgeable about the park and it's history. It was a nice stop in between food stops. ",Wicker Park,June 2016,40
nice area!,GuillermoM311,"we took a long walk by the lakeside trail and detoured via W North Avenue looking for a Williams Sonoma store, and realizing we were on our way to Wicker Park made it ieasier to give it a shoot. It is a lovely neighborhood with plenty of options for things to do, see and eat! Great on weekends too but a bit crowded and messy. On our way back we stopped on Second City and Old Town to make our day complete.",Wicker Park,May 2016,40
Historic Homes,MikePromotes,"An outstanding neighborhood, full of history and updated on a regular basis by those that buy and live in this area.  You will love the old homes and surrounding historic buildings.",Wicker Park,September 2015,50
"Great neighborhood for shopping, bars, and restaurants",Nadine B,"It's a little crowded and the traffic is rough, but this neighborhood is worth checking out for all the shopping and nightlife. It has come a long way since I first moved to the city. ",Wicker Park,August 2016,50
Lovely area to visit,Steven B,"This is one of the neighborhoods that I would live in if I were to move to Chicago.  I like the eclectic feel, the bars, restaurants and shops.  If I understand correctly from the locals, this is an area that's currently up and coming so it's probably changing regularly but right now it's very enjoyable to walk through.",Wicker Park,August 2016,40
Super fun and colorful neighborhood,Carlabnk123,"Fun, fun, fun. Everybody here is happy. Awesome unique restaurants, bars and one of a kind boutiques. ",Boystown,September 2014,50

Great drinks,AVChicago2012,went with some friends and this is one fun place..everyone is so friendly and the drinks are strong..be careful as some violence has occurred lately..lots of option for food and things to do,Boystown,February 2015,50
A different type of neighborhood,Allen21096,"You'll know you are in Boystown when you see the street art with the rainbow themes.  There are more than a few gay-friendly bars and restaurants, as well as eccentric and erotic shops.  It is pretty much located on Halsted St. from Belmont Ave. to Addison St.",Boystown,June 2015,30
Public VIP tour is great,griffeyisastar,"We did the public VIP tour with a 7 year old. Being able to run around the field for 15 minutes was the highlight! The other sites, Skybox, and video control room were also cool. Would have loved to see the Bears locker room, rather than the visitors - but that was still neat.",Soldier Field,June 2019,50
Good venue,Gofly2,"We experienced The Rolling Stones here and as expected the band was superb! The venue was clean with plenty of restrooms. The many beer purchasing options made it easy to not miss the show. The staff was extremely helpful and kind. The only complaint we could lodge was after the concert ended we were pushed out fairly rudely which took away from our experience. I get it, the staff wants to go home, but we spent a lot of money to basically be kicked out in a hurry only to stand in line leaving.",Soldier Field,June 2019,40
Concert,930heatherl,Not a great place to see a concert it was to hard to get in and out of . I would pass on the next concert you need to walk over a mike to reach lift/uber pick up .,Soldier Field,June 2019,10
Lucky Dip Tickets 2019,0soup4u,"In any case, if you have lucky dip tickets you better be prepared to stand up for several hours. We probably would have been standing a lot even if we had seats, but it would have been nice to have the option. For that matter maybe we did have seats somewhere, but if we did then the people staffing the event were too poorly trained to tell us where they were. The Stones were awesome as always, which is the reason my rating is still very good in spite of our fiasco with the 'lucky dip'. tickets.",Soldier Field,June 2019,40
"Fabulous Stones Concert, lousy venue ",hhsup,"However, Soldier Field is a disaster. The stairs to get to upper levels is only 4 people wide. Not so bad entering but leaving is a massive disaster. Thousands of people trying to get to the stairs and down. Once on the ground level it is even worse with everyone move a few inches at a time; don’t fall down, you will be trampled. The gates are only half open. It took more that hour to walk out and get to the nearest train station. Chicago needs to forget about spending 200+ million dollars on a new Obama Museum and instead use the money to improve Soldier Field access and add a train stop near it️This is the worst stadium I’ve been to out of at least 10 different venues. ",Soldier Field,June 2019,10
A remarkable building,seanrigbybrown,"Even if you have no reason to go in, it's a remarkable building to see.  Make a point of it.  How many times do you get to lay eyes on a hundred-year-old building that takes an entire city block, was the largest commercial building in the world when constructed, is still in the top 20 globally for size, and is a unique piece of Chicago architecture?  Highlights: the main floor designer galleries, the Egan showroom, and see if you can find the picture of the building under construction, with dirigibles being used to lift construction materials to the roof.",Merchandise Mart,June 2016,50
Massive office building,hart277,"The building takes up a whole city block and really sticks out, so you can't miss it, but it's almost all office space with some retail on the lower level. The brown line EL has a stop right at this building",Merchandise Mart,July 2016,40
An artsy neighborhood with some fun shops,LMK101,Wicker Park is an up and coming neighborhood that is going through gentrification.  A lot of artsy shops and good restaurants.  Keep an eye out for some nice shops and good real estate. Close to the subway and public transportation.,Wicker Park,September 2015,40
 Artistic & Hipster Neighborhood,Matthew  M,"This is a cool neighborhood with lots of shops, restaurants and bars along Division & Milwaukee Ave. The tree-lined side streets have the most beautiful historic homes people live in which is astounding to look at especially in the fall season! There is a park which is nice to sit relax if you have kids or even after hitting up the shops & bars. ",Wicker Park,October 2015,40
LITTLE SHOPS OF AWESOMENESS,amger69,"Fun, trendy and off the beaten path. Great shops and restaurants. People watching is great too. Transit from downtown gets you there quickly.",Wicker Park,October 2015,50
great chicago history,chicagoshelly45,"many great bars restaurants and a great old Chicago neighborhood. driving around looking at the old homes mixed with the new and upcoming buildings in this area is always fun. a lot of the old is making way for the new, a nice mix of redone old and new is a great contrast of Chicago styles. not an unsafe neighborhood, but be aware of your surrounds.

"Wicker Park, escape the tourists",chanc2286,"My wife and I travel from Dallas to Chicago twice a year for quick, two night, vacations.  We recently started staying at the Ruby Room in Wicker Park off Division, we love it.  While we ourselves are tourists, we love to find enclaves within the city to escape the typical tourists areas, Wicker Park is perfect.

Not what we expected,timothyo724,"Came to find bargains, but this place is more for wholesale to retail clients. Years ago they used to have more available to the public. Historic building",Merchandise Mart,March 2017,30
Historic building,DanielK708,We only came by to pick up an item from my husband's company's space. It is an amazing building with a lot of things to see from retailers. Didn't have a lot time to look around but seems like a place you could walk for hours.,Merchandise Mart,March 2017,40

Smooth ride,Cassyharris,We visited in mid January and the views were breathtaking! The ride was smooth and the heated compartments were perfect!,Centennial Wheel,January 2019,50
Your typically Wheel,matjaz2002,It does give you a great view of Chicago skyline and water. I guess after going to all the towers this was like been there done that. Nothing special. Your kids will have a great time if they are not afraid of heights.  It was nice in that its only you in the gondola. Your not pack in with a lot of strangers.,Centennial Wheel,August 2018,30
Skyline ride,juliebfromindy,The centennial wheel is iconic Chicago.  The ride has easy access for all. It is a very smooth ride with a nice narrative about the view. Staff is quite friendly and helpful. Parking is easy and there is valet available. The cost is rather high $18 per adult but it is a must due when in the Windy City. ,Centennial Wheel,March 2019,40
Great view of the city,mommajoColumbus_Ohio,Fun experience--just remember to bundle up when it's cold because it's really cold on this ride!  A must do on your trip to Chicago! ,Centennial Wheel,March 2019,40
Very interesting museum; great for kids,Ex3,"We really enjoyed seeing the native animals of Illinois and the butterfly exhibit. If we had small children and lived in Chicago, we'd belong to this museum!",The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,May 2017,40
Butterfly exhibit one of the best in the country,Bill J,"The Nature Center might not be the largest around but the butterfly exhibit is exceptional in that it offers both the delightful immersion in butterflies along with a extensive educational section that makes this one outstanding. Other exhibits have great educational value.  For kids, besides butterflies, the water courses have got to be a big hit when you can literally let your hands do the walking through the water.  Adults will enjoy not only the butterflies but the local, prairie exhibits for insights into where Chicago was built",The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,May 2017,50
More than business,MikePromotes,"What a place.  It's quite large, located right on the river, and has a spectacular view of the river and the city.  This is a very well known place.  Get to know it, you will enjoy it.",Merchandise Mart,September 2015,50
Wicker Park,TheValleytoTheWorld,This is a cute and fun little neighborhood. Similar to Los Angeles' Melrose but with a Midwestern charm.,Wicker Park,June 2014,50
Edgy but fun,Coreen S,"Liked this area, sort of like the East Village in NY. It has some fun independent shops.  Don't need to spend a ""day"" there but worth seeing if you like the funky side of towns.",Wicker Park,June 2015,40

BEST NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHICAGO!,andrewbF3525TP,"Wicker Park used to be dangerous and awful.  Then it became hipster and cool.  Now its rapidly gentrifying.  But make no mistake: this neighborhood is FANTASTIC.  It is LOADED with delicious restaurants and bars, and there are many fashion boutiques as well.  The park itself is just OK, spend your time walking around the perimeter roads (Division, Damen, North, Ashland ... Ashland is the least interesting) and the primary cut-through road (Milwaukee Ave).  Take a little time to wander through the side streets, there are many older homes that are quite nice, plus a number of new constructions sneaking in alongside them (its a hot neighborhood, many people are moving there as of June 2015).  You'll love it, do yourself a favor, go check it out.",Wicker Park,June 2015,50
Wasn´t wow,creatinidad,Must be interesting to walk around during the weekend. We did´t find anything interesting beside shops and restaurants. Maybe we didn´t knew exactly where to go. ,Wicker Park,July 2015,30
HUGE!,Illinoisnow,"This is a very historic building. To get the full story and know what you are seeing, I think you need to have a tour guide, as we did (Chicago Architectural Foundation). This building is in change mode right now, lots of businesses moving in and lots of restaurants following the crowd.  El delivers you right to door, on second level, by the restaurants.  Be sure to check out the large 'steps' that have recently been added, and the shuffle boards etc set up for the younger crowd.",Merchandise Mart,July 2016,50
Size does count,Studio69,"Enjoyed spending several hours here on a Thursday afternoon touring the various design centers. Expensive stuff but items hard to find anywhere else.

Great for children and adults,gary19191,A really great place to spend half a day. The museum is split into indoor and outdoor areas with displays emphasising and explaining the diversity of nature and mans' impact. The butterfly room is amazing as you stroll amongst live tropical butterflies and moths. There is a rooftop walk to view wild birds and walks amongst the prairie flowers  and by the lake. For  those with children there's lots to do. A great feature is the emphasis on wildlife in Chicago and Illinois. ,The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum,August 2017,50
WOW wonderful exhibit,AJLIllinois,If you loved the musical this is a must see-- honestly one of the best done museum exhibits we have seen. It is truly a totally immersive experience. Take the time to listen to all of the stories available  as part of the audio tour and you will learn  a lot about history.,Hamilton: The Exhibition,May 2019,50
Go during the week after 1:00pm.....,crunch6,"The best time to go to this excellent exhibit is at 1:00pm.  By then, all of the school groups have gone and you can hear all of your audio recordings.  This is very well done from the team that produced Hamilton.  This is a great way to learn more about Alexander Hamilton, his family, and the American Revolution and American Government.  Thank you to Lin Manuel for bringing this to Chicago first!",Hamilton: The Exhibition,May 2019,40
"Excellent history museum, including the influence of women and African Americans ",Jen M,"Parking was crazy. The lots at Adler and Soldier Field wanted $50. No thank you. Online prices were $20 but the online instruction said to print the ticket - we were already in the car so I didn’t have access to a printer. It didn’t say whether a mobile pass was an option and I didn’t want to chance it. Buy parking in advance and print the ticket at home. We ended up with SpotHero parking for $8 off Michigan Ave and taking Uber to the museum - $7 Uber each way. There was a small surface lot right next to the museum with city of Chicago metered parking. The lot was empty when we arrived (by Uber) at 10:00 so in hindsight that would’ve been our best bet - but we didn’t realize it was there until it was too late. If you have morning tickets like we did, it’s worth a try to park there. ",Hamilton: The Exhibition,May 2019,50
Gorgeous building and great for ideas ... pricey and much better on event days or with a designer,Shelliu,"Without a designer or builder license you can only get into the 1st 2 floors - the 1st floor has some nice show rooms but the 2nd floor is mostly food places (plus a manicure/pedicure place). During events or with designers/builders, you can get to the other 5-6 floors that have design rooms, textiles and more. It is worth stopping in given it is right on the river and such an old historic building but you likely wont find mjuch to buy there. At night, it is closed but worth going across the river to get a magnificent picture of the building.",Merchandise Mart,April 2016,40

Walking Food Tour,Jill B,"We did walking food tour through Wicker Park and Bucktown.  Highly recommend it... food was ample, I had to put my pizza and gyro in my bag because I was so full.  The guide was very knowledgable about the history and architecture... a really great afternoon!",Wicker Park,May 2014,50
Bit disappointed,SPea,"Overall would probably not recommend, we much preferred Old Town. ",Wicker Park,May 2014,30
Neat artsy-hipster area for shopping and food!,MavF_13,"Was here on a beautiful sunny day and it was perfect!!  Neat little neighbourhood that just stands out with an attitude of its own!

A bit out of the way from downtown Chicago but a nice breath of fresh air!  :)",Wicker Park,April 2014,40
Nice to be in,Francisco T,"I stayed in this neighborhood and I really liked the area. There are a lot of places to eat at like Piece's and Dimo's if you want pizza, and some other nice options. There will always be people around and 24-hours stores",Wicker Park,June 2014,40
A great neighborhood to walk and shop.,Patrick J,I was there with my family. While I was there a once a month bike ride with thousands involved rode through. There were many theatrical bikes with music and costumes. We at at a great Mexican place in the back yard  area . It is very different that sidewalk seating and much better. There are all kinds of trendy shops in the old area that has been converted to a hip touristy area. I enjoy one of the hat shops. It reminded me of an area in Manhatten that I visited in the mid 1970's,Wicker Park,June 2014,50
One of a Kind Show,gamingtildawn14,"This weekend is the One of a Kind Show at the Merchandise Mart in Chicago. This is like no other show! Approx 300 artists/vendors that are from all over the world and extremely talented. Only $10 to get in and plenty of food choices too. The artists are amazing - photography, jewelry, clothing, furniture, art, sculpture and so much more. You must check it out. They have it two times a year: Spring April 29-May 1 and Winter in Dec (perfect for gift giving). Wear comfy shoes and bring a couple spare bags or totes for all your treasures.

One of a Kind Show in One of a Kind Place,203marguerited,"I attended the One of Kind Show held in April at the Mart.  It is an interesting art and craft show held in April and December with over 300 vendors (in April), including fine art, jewelry, fashion and food.  One of the food vendors made me a delicious florentine crepe with spinach, cheese, chicken and mushroom sauce for about $12, which was delicious.  The Mart itself is an enormous building that serves as a design center with many showrooms for home renovation ideas.  Wish I had had more time to explore it.  It is a fascinating place with high end merchandise.",Merchandise Mart,April 2016,50
One of a Kind Show...,Mike16Chicago,"...was the reason why we went to the Mart.  I was born and raised in the city, so I've passed it literally hundreds of times - just never had occasion to be inside.  My wife had tickets for the ""One of a Kind"" show, so we had our opportunity to check it out.  Don't know if this show is an annual event or not, but if it comes around again, it's worth checking out.  We've been to similar shows, but if you like art...well, you never get enough - even if just to look.  It was a kick being in the building itself (famous, historic and everyone knows the Mart).  And, huge.  Fun to be in - if you can, check it out.",Merchandise Mart,May 2016,40
A Fascinating Walk Through History,719lynng,"Not only is the Exhibition done exceedingly well, but it offers a comprehensive history lesson about the founding of our country.  Each room presents a particular aspect of our early years, and the production values (both visual and audio) are great.  You are guaranteed to leave much better informed and wanting to know more - not to mention humming music from Hamilton the musical.  The location on Northerly Island is a bonus.  Parking options are more than adequate (but best to do a little homework if you want an alternative to the $50 onsite parking lots.)  A shuttle gets you to the Exhibition in no time.  Highly recommended by our 3-generation family!",Hamilton: The Exhibition,May 2019,50
Now a National Monument,NorthernSpy,"Took the first walking tour of the season in what's left of this intended worker utopia.  Our guides live in the neighborhood.  Be sure to watch the 2nd video after the tour- it's in the visitor center behind a little room divider- it gives a different and important viewpoint on subjects touched on in tour and gives some ideas of why this boss built ""utopia"" failed amid labor strife.   ",Pullman Historic District,May 2015,50
"Undiscovered gem, but not for long!",zumbr0,"President Obama declared this area a National Historic Site just recently, so we gave it a look over. It was an amazing history lesson and discovery of a gem of a neighborhood (still in the making!). It is absolutely lovely and interesting to walk around there. All the people in the neighborhood seem to be very interested in talking to you, telling about their neighborhood, explaining history, architecture, community. We got invited to a party, encouraged to buy a house and move in. Start in the visitor's center and have fun. ",Pullman Historic District,July 2015,50
"Site Good, Ranger Bored",Roger101052,As a history teacher I found the site fascinating and I hope that now that the NPS is involved it can be better preserved.

Closed on Labor Day :(,betha133,"We went to the building to see the Canstruction exhibits. Nowhere was it posted that it would be closed on Labor Day. There were many other couples who were also turned away... it was extremely disappointing as we booked a hotel one block away for that exact purpose. The building itself was open, but as we were walking around, the security guards us we had to leave. They did the same thing with several other couples. It seems to me that they could have allowed us to look as all of the stores were locked and inaccessible.",Merchandise Mart,September 2015,20
Easy to get to - Blue El/Damen,JoanneH02,"This is a great afternoon, just hop on the Blue El and go a few stops to Damen. Right outside the Damen Blue Line Station is Wicker Park central, with a pub on each corner and Damen/W North/Milwaukee with a few blocks of shops including City Soles on the corner of W North and Damen just off the El (advertise all European imports, all independent labels) and a few well-known designer boutiques and record shops. If you're into history, walk through some of the streets, I believe its one of the old German neighbourhoods. It's a safe/easy morning/afternoon away from Michigan Ave, and worth checking out.",Wicker Park,April 2013,50
Great breakfast,N_IrelandMarmalade,"What a lovely area - unique little shops and an assortment of interesting restaurants.  We had a fantastic breakfast in Francesca's Forno;  right on the corner opposite the exit from the blue line station.  Lovely staff, great food and atmosphere.",Wicker Park,April 2013,50
move over Mag Mile,santafefreak,"I found the shopping along Mag Mile to be quite dull; nothing I hadn't seen before or had access to in my hometown in Ontario. Thought I'd try walking through Wicker Park on my own and was so pleased that I did. Lots of little shops selling unique shoes, boots, jewellery, clothing etc. The area is great for walking; I felt completely safe and enjoyed the funky vibe. Check out Bucktown while you are there; it's just across the street! I spent a few hours one afternoon here and would recommend doing so if you aren't in the mood for the Magnificent Mile and the run of the mill shops along that strip.",Wicker Park,April 2013,30
Good area to wander around,galtons,"Wicker Park itself is quite small; nice, but just a standard neighbourhood park. Not worth going out of your way to go to for the park itself, but Wicker Park area is a great place to visit - good cafes and shopping on Milwaukee Ave (aka Hipster Highway) and then wander the nearby streets to see some of the period houses.

WOW!!!,Greg T,"This place is amazing. I got to go with a friend of mine in Nashville who has a retail shop. I never thought in a million years it would be so massive and have so much. My friend I went with got to go to any of the vendors and buy for his shop. And I got to buy what I wanted through him. Man, that was good.

wow...11 miles of hallways,WendyNeal,"This building was once the largest in the United States!  It covers a full city block with about 16 floors of home furnishings.

Never felt unwelcomed in a park until here,Spirit7dancer,"I have NEVER had a bad experience with a National Park before and this was the first.  I was really looking forward to visiting this site.  When we got there, the guy at the front desk was reading, looked up, and said ""Hiii?  Can I help you?"" (a tone that seemed to translate in ""are you lost?"")  After visiting 6 parks over the past week, I was a little taken back as the other parks are so welcoming.  I said I was here to get a stamp and check it out...he said ok and went back to reading.  Other rangers at the other parks always stood up and seemed engaging, telling us about the center, events, places to check out while we are here, and more importantly, made us feel welcome.  We walked around the center and I wanted to purchase a magnet.  I placed it on the counter and he just looked at me weird.  I said I wanted to purchase it and he said some lady's name around the corner takes the money.  I felt so awkward going into someone's office and asking if I could buy a magnet.  The lady looked at me weird too...at this point, I decided I just wanted to get out of there.  I felt so unwelcome, so uncomfortable that I just wanted to leave.  I told the lady that I changed my mind and left.  I always like to support the parks beyond my yearly pass with a purchase of some kind.  Luckily, I learned everything I needed from wikipedia and a few other sites prior to going, else I would have walked out not learning much.  The only nice person who greeted us was a guy, dressed in shorts and t-shirt who I assume was doing work outside, who was coming in as we were leaving and said welcome, thanks for stopping by!",Pullman Historic District,September 2015,20
Small venue and every seat with a view,K I,We were members at the Goodman Theater for years. Loved every performance but had a conflict with my work schedule. Easy parking and in/out of downtown. I would recommend becoming a member.,Goodman Theatre,December 2017,40

Underrated Chicago landmark,crazysox4,"In all our visits to Chicago, we had never done anything but ogle the Merchandise Mart from the outside, not realizing the entire first floor is full of luxury design showrooms for some dream shopping. We spent hours wandering through the showrooms! The building is amazing and I want to go back when their dream home is on display and their designer on call program is active (we were there right after Christmas). It's a seriously cool place and worth a stop in.",Merchandise Mart,December 2014,50
Largest area,HelenaGuerra,"This building is supposedly the largest building in the world in terms of area, or so the architecture foundation said. There are shops in the first floor but they are completely out of reach for me so I am not a big fan of walking around things I could never have... The building is def not a must in a city full of absolute jewels.",Merchandise Mart,March 2014,20
Home Sweet Home,mosthecat,"When we travel, we always pick the neighborhood we'd live in.  Usually, it's close to the neighborhood I live in in Chicago.  Wicker Park has certainly changed over the years.  No more 24 hr coffee shops and thrift stores.  Now, there's sushi restaurants and vintage boutiques.  I knda prefer the former, but I'm glad there's a sushi restuarant in the hood (though maybe 5 or 10 too many).  I can skip the nail salons and shoe stores, but there's still good cafes and Reckless records and a lively atmosphere, even with some chain stores moving in.  Easy to arrive from downtown via the blue line of the subway.  Just get off at north and damen.  Or get off at Division/Milwaukee and then walk down Milwaukee to North/Damen.  Then walk up Damen to Division and back up to Division/Milwaukee.  Whatever way you walk that triangle, you'll pass restaurants and stores (pricier every day, but still interesting).  Hang out with a coffee or head into the actual Wicker Park on a sunny day and just lie down.",Wicker Park,April 2012,50
Eclectic and Trendy,beachlover25,"I have been too a bunch of great neighborhoods outside of Chicago- in Montreal, London and such. And Wicker park would range in one of my favorite ones!

Unfortunately most of the stores were closed by the time we went, and I can't wait to check them out on my next visit to Chicago. But the festival was a highlight of my short trip. It was crammed full of people, but it was the nicest crowd I encountered during my visit. It was the most diverse as well, with chill people of all colors and ages (although mostly younger). I don't know if that reflects the normal make-up of the people of the neighborhood, but I felt very comfortable and enjoyed the huge party. ",Wicker Park,March 2012,50
Good vibe,HelenaGuerra,"It's a great place to take a walk, shopping or eat. It has nice stores, good vibe and great restaurants. It's not a touristic area. It's very authentic.",Wicker Park,August 2012,50
Beware!  Most stores aren't open on Saturday.,VintagePro,"It's hard to figure why, but most of the stores are closed on Saturdays.  And Sundays, naturally.  I visited on a Saturday and stopped at the security guard's desk to ask a couple of questions.  He was very nice and told me it didn't make sense to him, either, not being open on weekends.  I wanted souvenirs, and he directed me to a news stand shop on the second floor that had great books about Chicago architecture, some very unique mugs, and some gorgeous jewelry.  I'll have to go back during the week next time to see what the rest of the complex is like.",Merchandise Mart,May 2015,40
Neocon,Juraj63,This is really huge building and I am visiting this place once a year in June.

There is enough clean restrooms and variety of fast food. ,Merchandise Mart,June 2015,40
Huge!,7mollys,"I attended NeoCon  at the Merchandise Mart.  The biggest commercial Interiors show in the country!  It was so confusing to navigate the building, especially for my first time there.  There are a lot of different elevators and staircases, you have to remember which one you came up.  I got lost a couple times.  There was also so many people who attended the show, it was hard to get anywhere, and the food lines were horrible.  But, I really like the building and how it was an old department store.  It also offers you cool views of the city and river.  At night it is really pretty all lit up.",Merchandise Mart,June 2015,40
Really beautiful theater in need of more conservation,CaptTrouble,"We took the train to this area, and as an out-of-towner I think CTA needs a few more signs.  We got turned around but a local man helped us out.  We were practically tackled by some religious people on the street; a man with a stack of pamphlets and a name tag, part of a group, was shouting at us and reached out to grab me by the arm.  I managed to avoid him.  The area is a little bit rugged but nobody else bothered us.  When we left after the concert, NOBODY bothered us.",Auditorium Theatre,June 2017,50

There are new and antique rugs available is a variety of sizes and styles. We ended up getting one and having it shipped to us. We are delighted.

Don't forget to see Beer Baron Row,Taylor B,"Wicker Park is one of the fastest growing neighborhoods in Chicago. Located west of the Kennedy Expressway, west of Pulaski Park, northwest of the Loop, north of East Village and Ukrainian Village, east of Humboldt Park and south of Bucktown, Wicker Park has about 30,000 residents and is known for its local hipster culture, art community, nightlife and restaurant scene. The Wicker Park Historic District, which includes ""Beer Baron Row,"" where many of Chicago's wealthiest brewers built their mansions at the end of the 19th century, is on the National Register of Historic Places and much of Wicker Park has been designated as a National Landmark. The borders of the Wicker Park neighborhood are generally accepted to be the Bloomingdale Trail to the north, Ashland Avenue to the east, Division Street to the south and Western Avenue to the west. The area was filled with Polish immigrants after World War II and noted Chicago author Nelson Algren lionized the Division Street strip in his books. The demographics of the area changed dramatically in the 1960s with the construction of the Kennedy Expressway. Polish-Americans moved out and Puerto Ricans and other Latinos moved in. Today, Wicker Park is best known for its numerous commercial and entertainment venues and a convenient place to live for downtown workers due to the proximity of public transportation. The neighborhood is extremely trendy with high-fashion boutiques, cutting-edge gourmet restaurants and bakeries, European-style cafes, upscale independent grocers and art galleries. In 2012, Forbes named Wicker Park the No. 4 hippest hipster neighborhood in the country. Property values and taxes have gone up, increasing wealth for property owners and making Wicker Park more attractive to even richer real estate re-developments. But Wicker Park retains its historic significance. Several mansions still exist on Beer Baron Row on Hoyne Street between Pierce and Schiller. The Joseph Schlitz mansion at Hoyne and Ewing stood until the 1920s. The area reminds of South Prairie Street, where many of the city's famous retailers and meatpackers such as Marshall Field and Swift and Armour built their mansions in the late 1800s. It's all a great part of Chicago's history. In Wicker Park, however, you get a feel for the old and the new.",Wicker Park,September 2016,50
Hipster neighborhood,capture_thelight10,"Went here to explore while on business in Chicago. Have a friend who lives in Chicago and she suggested we meet here for dinner. I went early to explore the 606 and the neighborhood. It was popping with lots of activity. Many restaurants in the area, and lots of boutique shopping, coffee shops, and a couple book stores. Unless you are a big shopper, minus time for dinner 2 hours is plenty of time to push around this stop on the blue line (Damen).  Recommend you check it out for dinner.",Wicker Park,February 2017,50
Local Vibe,CMitchell1989,"Visted Wicker Park with a local. According to her this is the neighborhood alot of the employees around the Loop area reside. We had dinner here & walke to a few bars.

"The building is for a specific group of people, remember!",HappyIndyWoman,"I visit the Mart a couple of times a year.  I am a commercial interior designer and find it nice to show clients things in person rather than a catalog.  But I am really surprised that some people see this as a tourist attraction.  To me, it is a place to work and see relevant new products.  It is not for the general public.  The maps they put on each floor are very easy to follow and there is a reason that the elevators only go to some floors.  Please understand the real purpose for the building!",Merchandise Mart,August 2012,50
My Neighborhood,ChiWind,"Of course I visit regularly as this landmark building is in my River North neighborhood. There are several major annual events held in this building that are open to the public. I think my favorite is One of a Kind Show that consists of many and varied vendors offering their products and art as well as crafts and food items for holiday gifting. Otherwise, for the average tourist who may be interested in seeing the latest bathroom/kitchen/flooring materials for decorating there is plenty to see. You do not need designer credentials to visit showrooms.",Merchandise Mart,August 2012,50
Great Venue!,tjeatsworld,I love Soldier Field.  I saw The Rolling Stones here. The entry process was super easy.  Unlike other arenas the people who work here don’t yell at everyone.

It’s a lovely outdoor venue.,Soldier Field,July 2019,40
Rolling Stones Concert,jycdvd,"We were there to see the Rolling Stones. There was a delay to open the gates and there aren’t any benches or places to sit outside the stadium while you wait. I have health issues and almost collapsed from standing so long. Then, once you enter the stadium there are steps to climb because the staff blocks the elevator entrance. We had to show our tickets several times before we finally got to our section. Beverages and food costs are extremely expensive. Not to mention souvenirs. The Rolling Stones were great, huge screens were set up. The sound was good. Ushers are almost non-existent there. Note: parking around Soldier Field is very expensive.",Soldier Field,June 2019,30
CONCACAF (soccer) finals: USA vs Mexico,ImmerWandern,From the pics it is clear we were pretty high up in the 440s but sight lines were good. The seats were clean and functioning. Whatever your architectural opinion may be the combination of Neo-classical colonnade and contemporary stadium design is impressive. The lakeside location with magnificent view of the city skyline is one to be savored.,Soldier Field,July 2019,30
poor urban planning,Kelly C,"It takes an hour to leave one seat and get to a vehicle because of a lack of access to exits and poor urban planning of museum campus.  We were hereded like cattle into and out of the U2 concert in 2012 and things were not much better last night at Bears Fest.  Open all of the gates and permit people to leave out of any door.  The museum campus is not planned well.  One has to walk around and up and down just to get back to their cars.  The walking reminds of of DC, you can see your destination but you will have to walk in a half-circle to access it.  The old set up at Soldier Field and the grounds surrounding it was better.  Give me Soldier Field in the 80s and 90s any day.",Soldier Field,August 2019,20
Good views from upper level,themanofec,"We thought the views from the upper section were fine for a Bears preseason game. We enjoyed seeing the stadium for the first time too. It was nice to tour and walk around. We stayed nearby so the hotels near McCormick Place are walkable. I am curious looking at previous reviews if I'll get a copy/paste reply response from SF. Food options were pretty standard for a NFL team, similar in price as well. Does have the same rules about going to the game, we saw a lot of staff handing out the plastic bags; similar with security when leaving for herding people in the right direction.",Soldier Field,August 2019,50
Fun visit,BML111,We have always heard of the Merchandise Mart because of its sheer size-4 million square feet of floor space. It was the largest building in the world when it opened in 1930.

The audio guide is included in the price of admission and is often narrated by Lin Manuel Miranda. The 3-D show at the end is awesome! Allow at least 90 minutes to see it all.

Be prepared or get a guide,twicked,"There is a lot of history here, but not much signage. We took the train out from downtown Chicago at a reasonable price of $5 and arrived at 111th and Pullman station. We walked the half block and found ourselves at the closed Florence Hotel and then were thinking ""now what.."". Luckily one of the park guides stumbled across us as she was giving a tour and invited us to join, so we learned a bit about the district. Much has happened here, but almost all of the buildings and land have either been sold off or were destroyed by arson. At the end of the tour the guide took us to the visitors center and we got a more detailed overview of the region's rich history. But the only signs we found out in the area were signs with before and after photos of the factory which was destroyed by arson. I did not find any signs giving directions to the visitors center. So if you come out here be prepared to find your own way around and don't be surprised by the buildings which are literally crumbling before your eyes.

The rail car factory is a shell but the community still exists and seems to be thriving.   Recently became a part of the National Park Service, hopefully that will lead to more rehabilitations, better visitor amenities, more visibility, etc.   But even now, it's well worth the excursion to the South Side.

Pullman Historic District a few years away from being worth visiting,Thomastraveler2015,I'm local to the Chicagoland area so this was a spur of the moment visit. Not much to see if the visitors center is not open. The main building with the clock tower is being renovated as is the once magnificent hotel. The workers homes were impressive in red rows as is the church (being renovated) see a pattern. I would also caution that just west of the tracks is not the greatest neighborhoods so do not go wandering around. Stay on the expressways from the east and go during daytime. It will likely be better in a few years once more funding helps rebuild the area which was fenced off when we walked around the clock tower area.,Pullman Historic District,October 2016,20
"Solid theater, no big surprises",FromWindyCity,"The Goodman is a beautiful theater, Chicago’s premier venue. It’s located in the heart of Chicago’s theater district. It has two stages. I’ve seen many plays there and used to have a subscription. Some plays are very traditional, meant to please a conventional taste. They do venture out into some slightly experimental areas, too, occasionally staging new plays by little-known playwrights. Overall, it’s a solid choice for a safe, quality theater experience for people not seeking anything ground-breaking. ",Goodman Theatre,October 2018,50
Always interesting ,394vickie,"Saw Brendan Coyle in (Yes, he played Mr. Bates on Downton Abbey) St. Nicholas, a monologue show, an early work by Cormac McPherson. I don’t usually go to one-man shows, but I was riveted. I hardly blinked during the one-hour first act. So glad we went. We’ve enjoyed such a range of shows at The Goodman from War Paint to Rock and Roll (Tom Stoppard on the Czech Velvet Revolution) to this. Always an evening well spent. ",Goodman Theatre,January 2019,50
Excellent acting and directing. First-rate productions. Better than many Broadway theaters.,Alicia H,"I've seen many plays at the Goodman Theatre and have always been impressed with the cast, directing, and the sets. Yesterday, I saw St. Nicholas starring Brendan Coyle (of Downton Abbey). Coyle's performance was fantastic. Throughout the two-hour monologue, he kept my attention. He was very convincing as the jaded theatre critic who gets lured into consorting with vampires. Chilling. I highly recommend St. Nicholas. Come to the Goodman for great theater. The Goodman also has several bars that serve top-shelve booze, good wine and tasty snacks.",Goodman Theatre,January 2019,50

Amazing Play at The Goodman,feliciacjohnson,"How To Catch Creation is an amazing play. Wonderfully designed sets that gave sceen changes stunning fluidity. Terrific acting. Beautifully written. Some really great ""I didn't see that coming"" twists. The Goodman is an easy, patron friendly theater. And This play is perfect for this venue. A real must see,but short running play.

My First Visit to a ‘Gayborhood’ Was Great! ,AKAshon,"I came here on a Friday evening after visiting Lincoln Zoo and Conservatory and eating dinner at Lou Malnati’s. At the recommendation of Time Out, I decided to check out two attractions: The Legacy Walk, which were placards of influential LGBT people erected on rainbow-colored pylons and the Center on Halsted, a community center for LGBT individuals. The Legacy Walk was awesome! I loved learning about those who came before me and the contributions they made to the progress of the acceptance of LGBT. I was informed on who the founders of GLAAD were and how the first celebrity transgendered individual was met, not with hatred and disgust, but rather fascination. The Center on Halsted is interestingly attached to a Whole Foods Market. And it was a nice place for me to unwind after a long day of walking. I also got a great chocolate peanut butter shake at Chicago Diner (which was super busy at this time with a wait time of 30-45 minutes for a table of 2). I also saw the Furious Spoon which was shown in an Eater Chicago documentary about the gentrification of Boystown. This was my first visit to a gayborhood and it was a great experience! I really enjoyed the experience! I highly recommend the neighborhood for LGBT individuals! If I ever come back to Chicago, I will definitely be coming back here! ",Boystown,February 2018,50

Even the Walgreens across from the Damen Blue Line station is unique, with a huge vault in the basement and an ornate stained glass ceiling.

The actual park hosts a variety of activities, including a farmers market with 20+ booths on Sunday morning. Well worth a visit. ",Wicker Park,August 2018,40

Find your space at Merchandise Mart,619jeffry,"Merchandise Mar was built by the owner of the Marshall Field department store to handle an enormous volume of stock, until the Crash of 1929 killed the retail industry. The Kennedy family bought it, and now it functions as a giant retail and office conurbation.

On the evening of September 29th, I experienced one of the highlights of the current Chicago art scene on one of the building's walls.  A curated series of digital artwork was projected across the 2.5 acres of its exterior wall facing the Chicago River.  The digital projections were colorful and innovative.  These projections are scheduled to appear from now through December 2018 on Wednesdays through Sundays at dusk.  They can best be viewed on the Chicago Riverwalk between Wells and Lake St.  I highly recommend these cutting-edge digital projections.  What a wonderful, free treat!",Merchandise Mart,September 2018,50
Lots to see in regards to home furnishings and decorating,TarHeel,"We walked over from our hotel on our last day in Chicago after reading about the various furnishing and decor options presented at the merchandise mart. I believe only the first floor or two is available for the general public to shop, but one of the merchants said we could visit the other floors that are reserved for buyers just to look. Goodness, it can be overwhelming since there is a lot to see. Great place to get ideas for your home.

The line seemed endless but it moved quickly and in no time I was in a bucket.  Navy Pier is somewhat north of the heart of Chicago so the view on the water and the pier itself is better than the iconic skyscrapers.  As for price, it was at least in dollars what the London Eye is in pounds so not a steal but other equivalent rides cost more.  No senior rate, alas.",Centennial Wheel,July 2019,40
Awesome Experience!,paradisefound619,"My daughter, 3 1/2, and I LOVED this experience.  The ride cars are fully enclosed and it hardly feels like you are on a Ferris Wheel high above.  We loved looking around Navy Pier from above and seeing the skyline of Chicago. We went at sunset and it was perfect! The staff was very nice and were allowing people to sit with just their group and not strangers, which we really liked. Maybe it's normally like that?  A must on your trip to Navy Pier!",Centennial Wheel,July 2019,50
Biggest Ferris Wheel I have ever ridden! Fantastic views.,Andy1614,"This is the biggest Ferris Wheel I have ever ridden, and I have been on quite a few, one of my favorite rides. This one in 210 feet tall. It has 42 gondolas, which are totally enclosed, and air conditioned. Wonderful views of part of the city skyline and the waterfront, as well as a portion of Lake Michigan. At first we were discouraged by a long line, but then found out that they designed this thing very intelligently, so they can load and unload 7 gondolas at a time, so it goes very quickly.",Centennial Wheel,August 2019,50
Cheated of ride,John W,"This is probably a good ride, but pick your time carefully.  We paid full fare and there were showers in the area.  They never materialized beyond dots on the walk, but they pulled riders off the ride before we had a full revolution of the wheel after loading.  I complained, but the guy said, ""It was slower, so you got to see as much.""  Baloney.  I appreciate the concern for safety, but a rain check or refund was never offered.  Unfortunately because of the popularity of the ferris wheel the operators can treat the riders poorly because enough will keep coming.",Centennial Wheel,August 2019,20
Should be less than half the price they ask.,Tjrodeffer,We went today in August and I didn’t want to get on it because I’m terrified but I did it for my brother. It was over 80$ and we went around a total of 3 times. The employees were nice and so was the view. Overall the price and me being terrified is why I give it an “average” review. The one employee loved my shoes though you should give her a raise.,Centennial Wheel,August 2019,30
Fan from Germany ,Lem3,"Apparently, Chicago Fire is very popular in Germany. We had relatives visiting and the only request from the 16 year old was to get a photo in front of the firehouse. Well, she got lots of photos, bought a shirt that she said ""will make her friends jealous"" and had a tour as well. They were super nice and friendly and made our German relative very happy. ",Engine 18 Chicago Fire,July 2018,50
"Pretty Cool, but we felt a little awkward...",Sami G,"Was great to get to see the location and scenes from the show. Everyone at the firehouse was friendly enough and invited us in to look around (especially at their wall of show memorabilia) - we felt a bit awkward though (I mean, they are firemen busy at work) until we finally met one fireman who took some time to talk with us. We had heard that they sell firehouse/ show logo T-shirts, sweatshirts, etc. but it wasn't obvious where that was and no one mentioned it. But when we asked about it, they were happy to show us what they had - and the sales go to local charitable causes that the firehouse supports (e.g. for burn victims and families of firemen), so we were happy to contribute. Overall, a fun experience but probably hit or miss how personal an experience you will have depending on who you happen to meet and how busy they are. Also, one block walk from there to the precinct that is used as the front of Chicago PD - you can't go in but it was cool to see.  Final Note - we went during the day and felt comfortable, easily parked the car, but people cautioned us that its not a great neighborhood to wander around in at night.",Engine 18 Chicago Fire,July 2018,50
Amazing and friendly firefighters!,pallen386,"We arrived to have a look and take some photographs, and edged as close as we dared!

Amazing Experience ,OrionHiker,My 2 friends and I are massive fans of Chicago Fire and the whole franchise. So naturally coming to Chicago and visiting this station were on top of our list. Arriving out side you get the feeling that your actually in the show. We spoke to a very friendly and knowledgeable fire fighter who gave us a tour of the premises. We received a history of the station as well as an insight on how the idea for the show came about. Unfortunately their was no engine for us to see or any filming. But we would definitely go back again. ,Engine 18 Chicago Fire,March 2019,50

Sadly, cloud was against us first time but the tilt experience of being tipped over the edge of the building was awesome.

Fun interactive museum for fans of the musical,Katie T,Everyone in our group had a great time from age 8 to 64.  ,Hamilton: The Exhibition,June 2019,40
Fascinating,GBJ-Cookies,"The location of the exhibit on Northerly Island means for most tourists like ourselves it will take a little bit of willing to get there. For us it was a warm sunny day so we took a leisurely stroll through Grant Park along Lake Michigan to Soldiers Field. From here there is a free shuttle, but we continued our walk as we were told it was only a further 10 minutes away. Unfortunately for us there was a Nickelodeon event on next door and one of the guys working there told us to get to the Hamilton Exhibition we would have to walk along the beach. Twenty minutes later we were outside the perimeter fence but unable to gain access and had to turn around and retrace our steps. The exhibit is a little on the expensive side at $39.50 plus add ons, although we were able to take advantage of a offer price of 1 plus 3. I don't know if this being offered because attendance has been low, but when we turned up the place was practically empty. The exhibition itself is superb and should appeal to both fans of the musical as all our group were and history buffs as well. The audio guide is narrated by Lin Manuel Miranda and the exhibition neatly places pieces from the musical alongside historical events. There is a cafe and the obligatory gift shop. Prices for souvenirs are extremely high with some of the items available online for a fraction of the price. We returned to Soldiers Field via the free shuttle which plays music from the show on your short drive back.",Hamilton: The Exhibition,June 2019,50
Wonderful experience!,jmlhfl,"I visited this exhibit along with a large group of my extended family before seeing the show. It provided great background to the show and was quite informative.

It's a group of windows in the 360°Tower that Tilt outwards 1000 ft up. It's perfectly safe but my stomach flipped as the window tilted outwards. My palms were sweating as I clung on tight and thank goodness you are only tilted a few minutes. It is an amazing sensation hovering 1000 ft out. I'm glad I've done it, but never again. There is also a bar up there so you can calm your nerves afterwards. Wonderful views especially as night falls and the city lights come on. ",Tilt,November 2018,50

But The Winter's Tale (ends June 9) was just a delight and I think most anyone will enjoy it.  It starts out pretty dark but that is just to set the plot and then wait as it unfolds with some wonderfully creative touches and humor.  The second half will make you laugh out loud and of course, in true Shakespearian fashion, it brings it all together in a totally irrational way at the end.

Tilt not worth it,Bahamamama2013,"Just looking out over the city in this amazing building is enough.  I did not think, nor did the 3 teens I was with, the TILT was worth it- it is like 15 seconds of a tilt, pose for a photo, to spend more money- you can't take your own phone in to take pictures- so maybe the building with the glass floor would be better, I cannot compare, we did not do both. Save time and money and just go to the top of the building.  Chicago is such an amazing city- go explore!",Tilt,September 2018,30
Not worth the extra,ian_dempster,Having paid 23 dollars to go up you then pay a further 8 dollars to go on the tilt. It doesn't last long and the they want 25 dollars for the picture they take of you. Disappointing. ,Tilt,September 2018,30
For some! ,1202George,"It’s $7 additional to the admission price. Purchase on the observation deck. Is it worth it? That’s subjective. I have done it twice. It kinda freaks me out!

People see the Picasso as a monster, dog, lion, dinosaur, bird, bear and the list could go on and on.

"It was ok, but the Skydeck at Willis Tower is better",ThoughtsFromAPage,"My kids and I think this attraction is overhyped.  Several years ago we did the Skydeck at Willis Tower, and the kids still talk about it.  This time we thought we would try the Tilt.  It was ok- the line is long, everyone is watching you, and it is just not that memorable.  I would definitely do the Willis Tower again, but I do not feel like I need to revisit this one.",Tilt,July 2018,30
"Over in seconds, NO PICTURES!!",enforcer75,"I'll say something positive first, the views are great at the observation deck.  As far as the TILT, well, I would not waste my money there again.  Its over in about 30 seconds start to finish. I stepped off early(which was fine to do) and tried to take a pic of my family with my phone and was chastised in unison by the 3 staff members ""NO PICTURES""...10 seconds later when the ""ride"" was over they offered to sell me the one they took for 25$..what a joke( side note, my family of 5 spent $108.00 for the observation deck plus $45.00 for the tilt, I figured I could take my own picture since I had already spent $153.00).  I would direct everyone to ""The Ledge"" in Willis tower, we went there the next day, it cost a little bit more but the staff was very friendly, the views were just as good, and I got to participate in ""the ledge"" and take pictures of my own of my family, with no objections from staff.  Also there did not seem to be a hard time limit on the Ledge..we did not feel rushed and walked away feeling like we had a great experience and got our money worth.",Tilt,June 2018,20

When you get there you just walk over to open spot on the windows, hang on to the hand rails and OUT you go looking down over Chicago. You go out some , stop then go rest of the way out.

The United Club spans three levels in behind the stands and is enclosed offering a perfect spot to warm up on a cold game day.

"It doesn't get any bigger than this, does it?",Taylor B,"A few years ago, while redesigning our apartment, we joined our home designer to Chicago's Merchandise Mart to shop for new furniture and lighting and mirrors and other fixtures. We went from one showroom to another. By the end of the day, we thought we had walked from one end of Chicago to the other. What an imposing building! Completed in 1931, the Merchandise Mart was the world's largest commercial building for a period of 10 years. Located on the north bank of the Chicago River between Wells Street and Orleans Street, it is 25 floors high and two city blocks long with 13.6 miles of corridors. Only the Pentagon in Washington, DC, is larger. It once was owned by Joseph P. Kennedy of the famous Kennedy clan, which included President John F. Kennedy, Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Senator Edwin Kennedy. Renovated between 1986 and 1991, the Merchandise Mart now contains a public shopping arcade on the first two floors, which contains retail stores and restaurants. On the outside, along the river, often overlooked, are a series of eight pillars with large busts on top. Created in 1953, this is the Merchant's Hall of Fame and each of the bronze busts represent a famous retailer such as Marshall Field and Frank Woolworth. Guided tours are available. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes.",Merchandise Mart,January 2019,50
Magnificent & Perfect evening entertainment ,lablife46,The huge building is impressive and a sight to see. In its heyday it must have dominated the shoreline.

Looks different watching people do it, to how it actually feels when you do it yourself. However it is a little pricey. 28 dollars for anyone over 6 yrs old,  so it was expensive for my group of 3 adults and 3 kids aged 11 to 16. Then a further 7 dollars each to do the Tilt experience. But as I said, the views of Chicago are Incredible.",Tilt,March 2018,40

Nice city views,MelissaClaire93,I was super skeptical of the Ferris wheel until I saw that it was a closed in pod (similar to the London Eye). We went around 7pm in early November and there was barely a line. We got a whole pod to ourselves. You get 3 rotations around and it’s not terribly expensive. It was beautiful. Nice views of the city. I imagine in the summer it would be quite crowded but I would try to check it out. ,Centennial Wheel,November 2019,50
Felt very awkward and unwelcomed,Ana G,"After reading all the previous comments and as a big fan of the show from Miami, FL. I really wanted to get a tour. When we got there the doors were open and went in and at the same time they got a call which it was cool to see them get ready to leave however, left us feeling awkward not knowing if we should wait or leave, then an old man came up to me (not very welcoming) hardly said a word just looked at me and went back inside, while we waited on the bench he started closing down the rolling doors...It was super awkard... it very unfortunate because I was really looking forward to a tour and even my 9 yrs old daughter was excited because she knows I'm a big fan. We left without really speaking with anyone.Hope someone else has better luck.",Engine 18 Chicago Fire,July 2019,30

It's thrilling and so fun.  Only takes a few minutes - it tilts out 3 times.  If you're a little iffy on it, no worries - you can easily just step off at any time it if gets to be too much for you.  Otherwise, hold on and lean in!  Look out, not just down.  Then when you leave the building, look back up to really appreciate how high up you were!  I loved it, and highly recommend the extra $8 for the Tilt.",Tilt,October 2019,50

Tilt 30 degrees above the city,SharonB231,Tilt is a small extra charge after you are in the observation deck. You can save some cash by purchasing tickets online. You stand on a platform holding on to rails and are tilted 30 degrees. Whole experience is less than 2 minutes. They take pictures of you and try to sell them to you after. You are not allowed to take your own pictures. I am not afraid of heights and this was mildly thrilling. Fun to do once but not something to do each time.,Tilt,November 2017,30

History Comes Alive In This Presentation,Andrea L,"After seeing the musical Hamilton in Chicago March 2018 and in Puerto Rico January 2019, we simply had to see Hamilton the Exhibition. In the beginning this museum acknowledges there were discrepancies in the facts of the musical and encouraged visitors to notice them as pointed out in each section of the exhibit. Every section of the exhibit was very well portrayed and several were very unique, state of the art presentations. The time line started with Alexander Hamilton’s life in St Croix then followed him to New York and his astonishing contributions to the formation of the United States of American. They do adhere to your purchased ticket times, so arrive close to or on time. You will spend at least 1 1/2 hours in this exhibit. Also parking is available at several lots on Northerly Island and a free shuttle runs between them and the exhibit frequently.",Hamilton: The Exhibition,August 2019,50
Fun experience for Ham lovers,Christy F,"Glad I went, but probably wouldn't go twice. I have to preface this with- I hate audio tours. I find them mind-numbing. I like this one better than most. However, I like to be able to read about the items that interest me, rather than just be part of a cattle-call. That said, the ""setting"" of this attraction was stunning. It was like being in a fun-house. LMM knows how to create an experience for his audience. I found the attraction quite long for the price, and could have skipped the final 3D video (though others in the audience seemed delighted by it- I'd seen the play twice...that's why I was there?? I was just ready to leave by that point). I really enjoyed the room about the Duel with Burr as well as the Winters Ballroom. Very well done.",Hamilton: The Exhibition,August 2019,30
What an exhibition!,LeviSparky,"My wife and I had a free afternoon in Chicago, and stumbled across this exhibition after visiting the Cultural Center.  What a grand and breathtaking tribute to the man, the musical, and this fascinating period of American history.  We do love the musical, but you do not have to be familiar with the songs or musical in order to appreciate this incredible exhibit.  References to the musical are cleverly woven into the exhibit, along with narration from Lin, Chris Jackson and Phillipa Soo, and each of the different rooms evoke key moments from Hamilton’s life, as documented in the musical.  The exhibition fills in many historical details about the different events in the musical, the Battle of Yorktown was especially interesting and informative.  Like the musical, this exhibition is grand, beautiful, and executed to perfection.  I hope that the exhibition finds a permanent home where it can be enjoyed for years to come, it is a treasure.

Scary but exciting!!,cheryl111948,"When we got into the elevator to take us to the 94th floor we really didn't know what we were getting ourselves into.  It was a gorgeous 360 degree breath taking view and when we did the tilt it was really scary for a bit.  Glad we weren't in the position for that long of a time.  Only problem I had was I thought that when I paid for my tickets on the main level it was to include the ""tilt"".  Nope.  They waxed us for another $$$.  Should be told at the bottom ""this does not include your view on the tilt"".  And then they wanted more $$$ for the pictures they took while we were on the tilt.",Tilt,July 2017,50
Overpriced,holibobsue,We were disappointed with this experience in as much as whilst the views were great there was not enough information about what we could see and so there was a limit as to how much we gained from looking out. I did the Tilt which was ok but nothing special. The cafe only offered drinks and cookies and the restaurant didn't open until 11 although the staff weren't sure! All in not worth the money.,Tilt,August 2017,20
Great fun and cheap too!,Andy810,"The sting in the tail is the punitive cost of the ""after the event"" photos which are punitively expensive. But many choose to buy them. Presumably their euphoric state helps loosen the clasp on their purse...",Tilt,August 2017,50
Girls Weekend,80erint,Pretty cool experience! The first tilt out is a bit scary but once you get past that the views are pretty awesome. I do wish it tilted out a bit further or entailed a little more but would still recommend trying it out the next time your in Chicago. ,Tilt,August 2017,40

"Where ""Pullman Palace Cars"" (deluxe sleeper RR cars) were made",RobertW2h483MD,"The town of Pullman was George Pullman's attempt at making a model company town, but it was close to ideal for the owner Pullman and much less ideal for his workers.  The workers who built the railroad cars were white men and lived in pleasant brick buildings that they might not be able to afford without working for Pullman, but they paid rent on those buildings to Pullman and bought their groceries and other necessities from the company stores.  George Pullman wanted every aspect to be efficient and profitable (each part self-sustaining and profitable for Pullman and his investors) and without unions or alcohol availability in the town.  In 1894, a financial recession caused a decrease in demand for Pullman cars, so Pullman laid off many workers, severely decreased the wages of other workers.  But the rent and other costs were not decreased.  This led to the Pullman strike and riots.  President Grover Cleveland sent in federal troops who shot many workers in the turmoil.  Pullman porters were Black men who had been hired for their ability to act as servants.  Those Pullman porter jobs were among the only decent jobs in Chicago area for Black men (outside of the killing jobs in the Chicago stockyards), but they worked anonymously as the customers on the sleepers were told to refer to all the Black porters as ""George"" (representing George Pullman).  The Black porters did not live with the White workers, but lived instead across the tracks in a Black neighborhood.  The Pullman porters were not involved in the 1893 strike and disorder.  The Pullman porters did not unionize until 1937.  I spent over an hour in the museum and then went on a tour of the neighborhood - led by a National Park Service guide.",Pullman Historic District,July 2019,50

Went on Saturday night to see Bernhardt/Hamlet, a new play by Theresa Rebeck about Sara Bernhardt performing Hamlet at the start of the 20th century. Directed by Donna Feore, well known for directing and choreographing at the Stratford Festival. It was funny and fascinating, to see the way society viewed women then and now. Even women with money and power. It happens that I saw the Shaw Festival Production of Cyrano only last week, so I was familiar with the relationship Sara Bernhardt had with Edmond Rostand, the playwright who wrote Cyrano and L'Aiglon.

It really isn't that frightening and is so short in duration to make it almost laughable.  The fact they won't even let you bring in a camera to take your own photos only proves what this attraction really is - a big money grab from tourists.  Skip it and save your money .",Tilt,May 2017,30
Meh,fsu23phd,Enjoy.,Tilt,May 2017,20
Tilt not woth the money but the rest of the Hancock building tour is,LAJ7,No need to spend extra money on Tilt but I do recommend the tour and views from the top of the Hancock Building.  The views are truly breathtaking and they have incorporated lots of Chicago history.  Well done.,Tilt,May 2017,20
Bit of a rip off,vonnie75,"It was quiet on the day we visited with no queues for Tilt, so we paid the $7 to have a go. It was okay, nothing really special, I would have been upset if I'd have queued for it. They don't let you take your own photo's & then try to charge $75 for 2 pictures............nah don't think so...!! I really don't understand why attractions charge so much for photographs, if they charged less & gave you the option to just e-mail them to you, surely lots more people would buy them...??",Tilt,June 2017,30
Not worth the money,simanup,I recommend spend the extra time soaking in the fantastic views from the 98th floor observation point.,Tilt,July 2017,20
Amazing place to view plants from around the world.,Sharon C,"It is well kept and welcoming to visitors. There is a restful spirit throughout. It was a surprise to find this gem and it was free,  though donations are welcome.",Garfield Park Conservatory,November 2019,50
Even better than the Lincoln Park Conservatory!,eeyyss,"Which I didn't think was possible! Every room is astounding both in size and depth of plants presented. It might be a little out of the way for some people, but its totally worth it. Plus they have musical events occasionally, and its a great space for that as well.",Garfield Park Conservatory,May 2019,50
Great conservatory.,812mattc,If you love plants this is the place to stop. Went here with little kids and they loved it too. Nice place to walk around especially when it’s cold out. Kids loved the little trails to walk on. Will be visiting again when we are back in Chicago.,Garfield Park Conservatory,November 2019,50
Loved the plants and even a slide for the kids,Ellen C,Beautiful place to visit on a cold day in Chicago with the kids!  It wasn't too far away and we definitely want to go back again soon!,Garfield Park Conservatory,December 2018,50
Perfect escape from the weather,MeisterF,"I can recommend the ""Inspiration Kitchen"" restaurant (within walking distance) for lunch afterwards.",Garfield Park Conservatory,November 2019,50
Night out,Santin0D,The arena is nice and stacked with memories of both the Bulls and Blackhawks. We went there to watch a hockey game one night and bball on another night. Good energy. ,United Center,November 2019,40
Good stop for basketball games,jopcd,We went to a Chicago bulls basketball game. If you're are a sports fan is worth it going. Very good arena. Lots of food and drink options on all the levels.,United Center,November 2019,50
Exciting atmosphere,GJCloch,"Great place for a basketball game. The game is not the only attraction of the event, with all kinds of experiences during the 4 hours.",United Center,November 2019,40
Best arena,daviemars,"With the UC turning 25 years old, the arena is still an great shape and they do a marvelous job taking care of it. A good time whether you're going to a Hawks game, Bulls game, or any kind of show. Plenty of parking lots all around the arena, too!",United Center,March 2019,50
"Great experience, will return!",McKGil23,"We just attended our 1st concert here. Had Lexus Club level seats and the amenities were nice, but I wish coat check had been open.

So high,SjanneMJ,It was definitely something else. It doesn't seem too scary until you actually see the window tilt over. My knees were shaking and my palms sweaty but it was a really cool experience. It is a little pricy (27$ to get up there and to the tilt attraction) but it's unlike any other tower. We had to wait about 45 minutes in line.,Tilt,February 2017,40
Just Watching Made My Heart Race,Kathy S,"I had to opt out. I just couldn't do it. My husband and two twenty-something daughters experienced the TILT firsthand and I stood on the sidelines and took pictures of them. When I observed the initial tilt, I thought, ""OK, I think I can do that"". But when I saw that it tilted out over the street twice more with stops in between, I knew I was not brave enough to step out on to that podium. As a matter of fact, my heart is racing just writing about it now! My family loved the TILT and the adrenaline rush it gave them! The TILT was an experience unique to Chicago that they added to their bucket list then checked off proudly. ",Tilt,August 2016,50
Fun & inexpensive,DragonDad,"While visiting the 360 observation deck, atop the Hancock Building, we spent the few x-tra dollars for TILT.  It offers a view strait down from floor 94. Kinda like you would see if you fell of building roof.  A little intimidating, at first, but nut bad at all",Tilt,January 2017,50
A Must Do if at the Observation Deck,BlackSheep773,"As someone who likes urban thrill-seeking experiences, this was a must do when I knew I was visiting Chicago. What was great was there was absolutely no line so I didn't have to wait for one of the traditional time slots to go. I didn't realize how much of a tilt (for lack of a better word) 30 degrees is. The only downside is you can't take photos yourself while tilting.",Tilt,February 2017,50
Something different,bluenaina,My family and I including my 9 and 12 year old daughters all did the tilt experience. It was nice to try diverging other than the ledge at Sears tower and it was a little thrill seeking. Much like every other Chicago attraction the cost to enter the Hancock observatory is a bit steep but the tilt experience was very reasonably priced. My last piece of advice is take your own photos after you do the tilt ir have a family member record you from the outside. You'll save money and have decent photos. ,Tilt,February 2017,30
Competent and knowledgeable,JackDawsonNorth,"Throughly enjoyed my accommodations at The Loop, clean rooms and quiet. I’d like to thank staff member Courtney who quickly became my favorite.

Must see!,MelissaClaire93,This was one of the top things on my Chicago bucket list and it was very worth it. We came at about 10:30am on a Saturday in November and there was barley a line. We asked about buying fast pass anyway just in case but they said we didn’t need it (saved us $100!). We were able to go straight to the elevator and only had about a 20-30min wait at the ledge. The ledge is the highlight. The rest of the views are slightly blocked by the way they have their windows set up. The ledge has a 60 second limit for parties 3 people and under and a 90 second limit for parties with over 4 people. This makes it a little hard to snap a lot of nice pics at the ledge. I understand why there’s a time limit (especially for busy summer days and such) but on days like the one we visited where there was hardly a line I’m not sure why a few seconds more would have mattered as long as you weren’t taking advantage. Just be prepared for quick snaps and have an idea of the pictures you want going in. My only other big gripe is that if you shop at the gift shop you HAVE to purchase a $3 or $4 bag to put the stuff in. If you don’t buy it they just hand the stuff back to you regardless of how much you purchase. That’s a little ridiculous. They shouldn’t be able to monopolize on that but since they do know to maybe carry your own little bag if you want some souvenirs. Other than that it’s a must see for any first timers. Really glad I saw it! ,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,November 2019,40
Get there early,Philippa P,We went back 3 times before we had enough time to do the building justice!  We ended up arriving at 9 am for a 10am opening and there was already a small queue.  Well worth the effort.  Absolutely amazing views.,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,November 2019,40
Feels like hovering in midair,manjushap1907,A must visit place when u visit Chicago.. A unique experience when you stand in the glass box and have unparalleled views of Chicago city.. Advise don’t visit this place during long weekends as the waiting time is too long and you cannot have a good experience due to the rush of the crowds.. You are given 1-2mins to just take pics and you cannot really enjoy the experience.. ,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,July 2019,50
Fun!,kristinaHouston,we went on an off day and there were no lines. It's cool to stand on the glass and look out. I would be disappointed though if I paid that much for the fast pass or waited a really long time for this. You only get about 1 minute on the platform.,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,October 2019,40
Stunning at 103rd floor,Sachin M,Obviously I am not the first to review a building which has been in existence for almost 47 years and held the position of tallest tower for 25 years. The views are absolutely stunning and breathtaking. You get some of the most amazing views of the city and the glass deck is an added attraction. Pictures says it all.,Skydeck Chicago - Willis Tower,December 2019,50

Excellent experience,518lauriek,"My son bought me tickets to see ‘Twas the Night Before by Cirque Du Soliel for my birthday while visiting him in Chicago. The theater is beautiful and very ornate (very much like the Shea’s Theater in Buffalo NY, they are very similar one hold 3600 one holds 3700 guests. We had seats in the balcony which were very good. The show was about an hour and a half long with no intermission. We had a drink and popcorn when we arrived and also took some pictures in the lobby where they had a moon set up. The theater is beautiful kept up very well, just gets super busy around door time to enter. The show itself was very good not your regular Cirque where so much is going on your not sure where to look you were captivated but not over whelmed. It is only here in Chicago for one week but this theater is worth visiting if you are visiting Chicago. They offer a lot of different shows my son said Madonna was here over the summer. Super easy to get to, my suggestion is if you are near theater go directly to the box office and buy your tickets and pick your seats rather than going thru ticket master you will save 3/4 of the ridiculous fees ticket master charges.",The Chicago Theatre,November 2019,50
Cirque de Soleil,L H,"Not as spectacular as their larger venue shows as this beautiful old theater would not be able to accommodate large scale acrobatics, but it's a charming, fun show with good pacing and some stunning aerialists (more of them would have been preferable); very enjoyable.",The Chicago Theatre,December 2019,50

Seems more than it is,621cathip,"on the observatory at the John Hancock Building, you pay $7 extra (plus $20 for going up) to step on a little glass booth that tilts about 30 degrees and you can peek down on the city. I thought the price a little too much for what it is.",Tilt,October 2016,30

We have been to the house, been to Ford's Theater, Lincoln's home in Springfield, Lincoln's Tomb, seen the clothes Lincoln had on during the assignation, seen Booth's gun, seen the chair Lincoln was sitting in, seen the bullet and skull fragments from Lincoln, and now, the actual bed from the Peterson House.   Awesome adventure.   I'm not certain why there are bad reviews for this location, it did depict some great history form Chicago.

Everything you need to know about Chicago,Taylor B,"My wife and I are members of the Chicago History Museum and we live about a half-block from the museum, which is located at 1601 North Clark Street, at Clark and North Avenue. But we don't take advantage of our membership privileges or visit the Museum Store or dine at the North & Clark Cafe as often as we should. However, we couldn't resist visiting the museum recently to see the current exhibit, Silver Screen to Mainstream--American Fashions 30s/40s, a stunning collection of 30 costumes featuring designer apparel from Paris, New York and Chicago but fashions worn by Hollywood celebrities. It also gave us another opportunity to browse through all of the other wondrous exhibits in this one-of-a-kind venue, from Abraham Lincoln's deathbed to the Chicago Fire of 1871 to the Chicago Stockyards to Fort Dearborn to the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 to Dr. Martin Luther King to the Pioneer, the first locomotive to operate in Chicago, to the 1893 South Side Elevated Railroad Car or L Car #1, to Dave Garroway and Kukla, Fran & Ollie and the emergence of television, to Chicago's ethnic neighborhoods to Chicago's sports teams to beer to jazz to home furnishings to kitchenware to Frank Lloyd Wright.

Great place for big conference,J-Birds,I attended a large conference here and it held over 8k people just fine with plenty of space to go take a quiet call or to get away from the crowd. It is a very large facility.,McCormick Place,October 2019,40
A must-see!,garyee46,"One of the top things we had to visit during our short Chicago stay. I've been to Chicago several times, but never took the time to visit Navy Pier. Glad I did! We had a good time, even though it was very cold. On-site parking made it nice.",Navy Pier,November 2019,40
Worth going,Goble A,It was a cool overcast day so didn't see whole lot other than the skyline and ended up going into a Harry caray bar which was very fun and had great pretzels and good beer. Would definitely go again on another busier day but didn't have a lot of time switch up.,Navy Pier,October 2019,40
Clean,Traveler201323,"I went here with a group of friends, the area is kept very clean for it to have such a high traffic volume. There are concessions available and a couple of rides. Mainly, take in the view of the lake. ",Navy Pier,September 2019,40
great family hangout,zoeindy,"very good place to hang out with your family or significant other. They have great parking, lot of places to eat including many coffee shops. Even though it was cold, it was enjoyable. Summer time would be great time to visit. They have rides, green gardens, live bands and ferris wheel. There is multiple indoor shopping also",Navy Pier,October 2019,50

Day out,susaneF9706XQ,"Spent the afternoon here with family.  It was a windy day but didn't spoil our outing  went on the ferris wheel,  but the other rides were closed. Views were beautiful of the skyline. It's a shame that they don't clean the glass each time a new group gets in. You are paying $18.00 per person. Lots of food vendors and a place to get out of the cold. Thought there would be more entertainment.",Navy Pier,November 2019,30
While visiting Chicago,Elari2019,Very fun place to visit. We enjoyed very much. Little boutiques selling arts and crafts. Plus souvenirs. Absolutely love the second floor - the green house with Palm trees and cool water designs. Family friendly. Clean and safe. It must be very pretty during the night. We went during the day. Had a great time.,Navy Pier,November 2019,50

Great Play - But the Theater Is Awesome In Its Own Right,Hajster,"If you haven't already seen Hamilton, get your ticket now before the production ends (and if you have seen it once or twice, go again). If you can't make it there before January 2020, then I'm sure like me you'll enjoy the next production the comes to the CIBC.",CIBC Theatre,October 2019,50
Impressive roof!,BenLar137,"Chicago has a VERY walkable downtown, and we did a lot of exploring.  We noticed these huge and amazing rooftop ornaments, and got a closer look.  Although the building has the size and general appearance of a classic older building, it is actually brand new, and truly fits in with Chicago's stunning architecture - the new always references the old, yet adds something different.  So if you're exploring downtown Chicago and see these amazing owls atop a beautiful older-looking brick building, it's the Harold Washington Library! Check it out!",Harold Washington Library Center,October 2018,40

Overhyped and Boring Chicago Air and Water Show,umalifam,"Forget about taking good pictures because you need at least a 1200mm long lens with a tripod to get a good larger picture of the jets. My longest lens is only a 300mm lens and the jets are so far away that they look quite small and uninteresting in the picture. To me, this whole idea is a complete waste of time considering that it is so hard to get there and that there are so many people around. The whole show would have been more interesting if they squeezed the 5 hr show into a better choreographed 1.5 hour show.",Chicago Air and Water Show,August 2016,10
Hamilton production was Great - Very Average Theatre ,Travel80,We were fortunate that our seats in the Dress Circle (Row C) were in the first 3 rows of the center of the Dress Circle.  TripAdvisor reviews and finding the website with views from specific seats are recommended before buying tickets. ,CIBC Theatre,September 2019,30
Beautiful Theatre for Hamilton,ToddandTia,"Finally bit the bullet and ordered tickets for Hamilton.  All our friends had seen the play and raved about it.  We felt it was still out of our price range...especially for NYC.  Getting tickets for our home town was impossible.  Tickets for the play in Chicago were reasonable and our seats were fantastic!  We were in MEZZRC seats 310 and 312 which were front and center.  Awesome view!  Maybe a little cramped for space, but not uncomfortable. If you've not seen Hamilton, and want to .. This is where you should go!",CIBC Theatre,September 2019,50

Hamilton Seats,themanofec,"We had boxed seats off to the right of the stage because it would get both close and were cheaper with the blocked view. Overall, you could only not see the far right of staging. Since most of the show is dead center, we really missed zero action for the show, just an occasional comment from the right of stage. Great value for how close the seats were to the stage. It can be crowded getting in, however, leaving and getting back from the theater was rather easy.",CIBC Theatre,August 2019,50
Huge library and awesome events,Lirumena,"I loooove libraries and Harold Washington its one of my favorites. Easy acces from train station and buses and its soo big!

Saw a lot of broken glass around.",Montrose Beach,July 2016,40
Great show!  Amazing performance!,irishgal20,"We saw Hamilton and can’t rave enough about the performance.  Our only complaints involve the actual theater and employees.  For some reason, they don’t allow early seating so it’s very inconvenient for those seeking refreshments and souvenirs.  Also, this made it a mad rush to be seated, even though we had arrived early.  It wasn’t well directed.  The people next to us missed their seat but were given late arrival escort which certainly disrupted us and those around us.  ",CIBC Theatre,July 2019,40
Amazing!,forest j,"I will admit, despite all of the positive reviews I had read, I was skeptical of seeing Hamilton. The cast in Chicago blew me away. I was entranced from the first moment until the end. The venue was perfect, even if the lines weren't handled the best coming in off the sidewalk. With that many people, you'll have hiccups though. I'm entirely proud of having gone to a show here, and I will be back again soon.",CIBC Theatre,July 2019,50

The show was fantastic!  My students enjoyed every moment of the experience--from the wonderful setting of the theatre itself in the historic Pumping Station (which coincided with the setting of the show on the submarine) to the acting and acrobatics, lighting, scenic elements, and costumes.  Conversations have continued for weeks as they continue to remark on the experience.  Thank you to the Group Sales staff for making the purchase and receipt of tickets easy and pleasant, and thanks to the cast and crew for a wonderful production.

Beautiful Venue!,BillT80127,"This theater is beautiful! This well maintained, 100+ year old theater is a great place to see a production. To save a few bucks, we sat in  the upper balcony. I was concerned we wouldn't be able to see the show very well, but that was not the case. The angle of  the seating is perfect to see over the people in front of you, so there really isn't a bad seat in the theater.",CIBC Theatre,June 2019,50
"Hamilton was exceptional, theater space...average",Anonymous855,"The old theater only had 6 stalls in the Ladies Restroom on the mezzanine and no where to stand waiting for the doors to open.  All of that is manageable but the chairs are set at a level where if the players come forward on the stage you cannot see them.  That's if you can see over the heads of the modest staggered rows in front of you.  Again, an old theater that needs some work.  Staff was anxious.  Tickets were more affordable than Los Angeles though and performance was very good.",CIBC Theatre,June 2019,40

Hidden Gem,Fischermom,"Not too many people know about this museum and I am selfishly okay with that.  Hidden within the University of Chicago campus, this museum is more accessible than the larger Field Museum. Devoted to the study of the ancient near east, it was founded in 1919.  The museum displays objects recovered by Oriental Institute excavations in permanent galleries devoted to ancient Egypt, Nubia, Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Anatolia, and the ancient site of Megiddo, as well as rotating special exhibits. Entrance is by donation and you can rent an ipod and get narration for the exhibits.  My kids loved this museum because they can get up close and even touch some of the exhibits.

"Great theater, tiny seats",nancyk818,"Don't be afraid to get a cheaper ticket back farther or along the side. Unless the seat says ""obstructed view"" it should be fine. Theater very well set up, so even a tall person in the row ahead will not ruin your view.  We enjoyed Hamilton and the facility is great. The seats are small, so if you are 200# + you might feel a bit squished towards the end. ",CIBC Theatre,April 2019,40

Les Miserables - Awesome Staging and Production!,Carl_CC_Rider,"We were here to see Les Miserables, and this was a great theater to see it in.  The theater is intimate, and the ""dress circle"" are perhaps the best seats - you are high enough to see all the action, but still close enough to get the full effect.  Bathrooms are small, so you need to pre-plan your intermission, but it's otherwise a very nice theater.  This production of Les Miserables was excellent!  This is a classic that brings high expectations with it, but his performance delivered.  The way they used projected images on the backdrop really added richness and depth.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,October 2017,40

Not as bad as most people say...,ChrisRosenRosen,"I read a lot of reviews of the CICB Theatre before buying Hamilton tickets. The reviews were either high of very low, which was confusing... I am not the trolling type and don’t review things unless I feel there is a need to. In this case I would like to reinforce some of the more positive reviews. The theater was easy to get in and out of, the condition was very good for and old theater. Yes, the bathrooms are down starts and they are not to movie mega-plex standards, but I am there to see a show, not critique bathrooms. The show was amazing and it was a seamless experience for me and my family. Lots of reasonable parking nearby.",CIBC Theatre,April 2019,40

The most beautiful library I've ever been to,seeKristenTravel,"The most beautiful library I've ever been to. Seriously. The architecture from a distance doesn't look like it would be a library and when you see the scale up close, it's amazing to think about the contents. My best friend and I visited in April, during a week day and had to scope out every darn inch of this place. We took the old-time wooden escalators and checked out the views from every floor. There was also a spectacular art display of veterans dogs tags symbolizing the sacrifices made in war and it was so moving and so powerful. This place is filled with arts, history, and of course LOTS AND LOTS OF BOOKS!! Definitely a must for someone who appreciates architecture, history, or just some good reading.",Harold Washington Library Center,April 2016,50
Gorgeous library,Victoria K,"I am a huge lover of libraries and this one didn't disappoint. Cruised around all the floors - it is a quiet, peaceful space to get things done surrounded by books. One of the floors has jigsaw puzzles and games to play. There are displays about Chicago, book clubs and staff picks. The Harry Potter architecture with huge green owls is very cool and dramatic. First thing I did is get a computer - it was easy and I was able to focus on my work. Or if you have a laptop, there are quiet / less public spaces to hunker down in. If you love libraries, check out this one.",Harold Washington Library Center,September 2016,50
An excellent center for large conventions,BPB2012,I attended a large convention where more than 32000 delegates participated at this Convention Center which is a huge property with wonderful facilities for holding large conventions with numerous number of meeting rooms and a very huge place to hold plenary sessions. Overall an excellent place to hold large conventions.,McCormick Place,July 2017,50
High quality production,karenG8729CK,The intimate setting in this small theater belies the high quality production. The play I saw was equal to any Broadway play I have seen. I was visiting my sister who recommended the theater. She said that she had never been disappointed in any of the many productions she had seen. ,Lookingglass Theatre Company,April 2018,50
Go every time when in Chicago,SnowBankerVT,"Saw Moby Dick, Circus, and Plantation.  My very first time, I went to LookingGlass only because I could't find another show in town I liked, but LookingGlass was nearby and price was reasonable.  It was Moby Dick, not a title that inspired enthusiasm for me but wanted to see some local theater anyway.  Well it completely blew me away how good the show, theater, and ensemble was!!!  Been back two more times for two other shows, each time not caring and not knowing beforehand what the show was about, and loved it!  All three shows were very different types of shows, but excellent and memorable.  A testament to the director and the ensemble's approach to each show they choose to produce.  I would put these guys in the same league as any of the best traveling shows you see coming through your own local city.  This is a small local professional theater group choosing stories and performing at the same quality as any touring Broadway show.",Lookingglass Theatre Company,February 2018,50
Built for bikers / joggers not walkers,EsmeBennion,"Who is this for?  Speedy bikers with helmets but not for mom's with strollers or ordinary people who want to walk.  I went to walk with a friend, not jog or bike.  It was very crowded and the bike/ wheel lanes have most of the space.  The narrow blue soft jogging lane did not let us walk and talk.  The trees are planted but the landscaping is sparse. Hot, no shade. It will take time for developing drink and snacks places at street level.  Need signs for public toilets too. Maps are good but need some direction sign mid- exit and better locations.  I was trying to meet someone coming from the opposite direction and we couldn't tell where we were.",The 606,June 2015,30

Fabulous production of Aladdin!,rjrjj,"We went to the Saturday matinee performance of Aladdin, and the entire experience was fabulous! The performers were absolutely amazing, the orchestra was fantastic, the theatre itself was beautiful, and the sound was perfect. Wow! What an experience. We LOVED it that you are not allowed to record/photograph the performance, turning off cell phones -- they actually confiscated cell phones of people trying to sneak videos! Yay! We really loved Aladdin, the original songs that were not in the movie, and the way they changed some elements of the story for live theatre -- it all was perfect! Genie was played by Korie Lee Blossey at this performance, and he was FANTASTIC! So was Michael Bullard as Iago. Otherwise all the performers were the ones published, and they were the BEST! What an excellent venue for a magnificent performance. The Cave of Wonders was my favorite, and it was over the top in every way. This is a must-see before September 10!!",Cadillac Palace Theatre,August 2017,50
Amazing!,GabrielleKM,"I love ancient civilizations so this was right up my alley. Half the museum is closed until the end of July so if you go before August, you will only see half.

Pretty but crowded and obstructed view,donaldbV2703FD,I guess I’m spoiled be the Alabama Theater in Birmingham. We saw Anastasia yesterday at the Nederlander. Saw Hamilton today here.

They also have the women's bathroom on a fast-track during intermission.  There are limited view seats...but for Hamilton, at least, most takes place center stage, so our limited view seats D 15, 13, 11 and E15 were well-worth the price savings.

Beautiful location in the historic water works building, intimate setting.  Wonderful, well done. ",Lookingglass Theatre Company,January 2018,50
An evening well spent,Nancy A,"In Chicago for the weekend we were looking for an additional activity.  Although unfamiliar with Lookingglass the ads for Hard Times were intriguiging and the venue was convenient.  We are so pleased that we made that choice.  The script was powerful and the execution was brilliant:  acting, set design and execution, directing beautifully integrated.  The venue is a bit hidden, but actually easily accessible.  The facility accomplishes everything that is necessary for such a production and I'm assuming can be flexible depending on the needs of the show, which is a real plus.  We will certainly be sure to check out Lookingglass on our next trip to Chicago.  Well done!  ",Lookingglass Theatre Company,December 2017,50
Best small theater in Chicago,jm_judi,"Hard Times was a terrific theater experience while visiting Chicago. I went there twice this year, also May, and not disappointed.  Easy to find and no bad seats. They make theater that matters",Lookingglass Theatre Company,December 2017,50
Hard Times,ctisone,"The Looking Glass production of Dickens' ""Hard Times"" engendered for me a new level appreciation of Dickens' genius, as well as furthering the well-established tradition of on-stage acrobatics for which Looking Glass is famous.",Lookingglass Theatre Company,November 2017,50
Youthful energy and athleticism bring Dickens' Hard Times to life !,sanjay42k,"On a brief trip to Chicago, sought out Lookingglass Theatre because of previous wonderful experience (Arabian Nights).  Love the book, which I had never seen performed, and was not only satisfied, but wonderfully entertained!  Wonderful, mostly young actors (and a few solid veterans!) who gave it their all, including some from a local Circus school who impressively and athletically brought the story's circus atmosphere to the small stage !  A lovely evening's entertainment - love supporting this artistic gem !",Lookingglass Theatre Company,December 2017,50
Awesome Classic Theater,lauralam,Beautiful Theater that was clearly one of the nicer theaters in Chicago back in the day. It is beautifully decorated with stone walls with pretty crown molding and accents. We saw Aladdin and it was the perfect Theater for this show. ,Cadillac Palace Theatre,August 2017,50
A beautiful classic theater,JVM-Milford-MI,"We visited the Cadillac Palace theater to see Aladdin. A small theater with a capacity of about 2,500 people. It's beautiful. I recommend the LOGE seating. They have some small bathrooms on the top floor and larger bathrooms on the main floor. They also have a bar with snacks, water, wine, and spirits. Enjoy. ",Cadillac Palace Theatre,August 2017,50
Cadillac Palace Theatre,candy461953,First time to Cadillac Palace theatre. Event was Disney's Aladdin. Theatre was just beautiful. Sat in Orchestra section which had great view of the entire stage. Theatre with good acoustics and lighting. Bathroom facilities clean and no long wait. Lots of parking in the area but I suggest that you go to ones that advertise discount night rates if you go to evening performances. Entire experience was marvelous.,Cadillac Palace Theatre,August 2017,50

Hamilton Great - Theatre was just okay.,Donegal1968,We had seats on the mezzanine level. I should’ve done more research as I did not think the seats were very good. Hamilton the musical on the other hand is fantastic. Definitely worth seeing just research your seating options.,CIBC Theatre,March 2019,40
BEWARE THE SUITE PACKAGE SCAM!!,Michelle F,"I went to buy 4 tickets for Hamilton in Chicago (june, 2019) and found 4 seats in one row but it wouldn't let me purchase them as it would have left one seat empty in the row and the system won't allow that. So, I selected 2 seats at the end of one row and the corresponding 2 seats just behind them for me and my family.  All four seats were the SAME PRICE when I selected those seats.  You have to BEWARE because they scam you later by tacking on an additional ""Suite Package"" for 2 of the seats stating that they are now $40 more EACH for those two tickets.  There doesn't seem to be a way to opt out of it.  I buy the tickets because I am just happy to get a seat in the house...and nice Mezzanine seats at that!  A few days later, I call Ticketmaster to understand this better. They tell me that I have 2 suite package seats and 2 standard seats.  I told him why is that not clearly stated. He said it was.  I said No, it wasn't.  When I selected those seats, all four seats were the same price per ticket.  It wasn't until later when you are going to check out that you see that the package is added on.  If these suite tickets have an add-on, include it in the price as you are selecting because to know they are more expensive and then I would choose to select a different bank of seats.  Because let's face it, I am looking at the price of the tickets and that dictates where I choose to sit in the theater. I don't like surprises and ""non-optional add-ons"" that aren't clearly spelled out.  ",CIBC Theatre,March 2019,20
Excellence All Around In Every Way.,traveltheworld012,"Of course we came to see Hamilton, which was so very excellent in itself. The theater is really an awesome place for any production I would think. This theater is smaller than some, but that is what makes it great, more intimacy with the stage and and production. We had front row balcony seats, reasonably priced, excellent view. Acoustics seem very good. Actors were fantastic. The orchestra though totally unseen is really good. Architecture here is really special and artistic. The bar service is great. Great location, and for us only a block from our hotel. Nice Italian Village (3 restaurants) only a block away as well. I believe we will be be back to see this musical again, bringing friends next time. Hooray for CIBC and everyone who made our visit wonderful.",CIBC Theatre,March 2019,50

The world gets brought to Chicago and you don't have to worry about desert heat or any intl. probs.,Virginia M,"This is a small hidden gem on the campus of University of Chicago, which is also worth a tour thru their admin dept., but you get to see wonders from Babylon and Assyria, Egypt and Persia and all within 1 sq block.  If you chk carefully it can be a quick tour that will take you thru 1000s of yrs of history and usually you have the place pretty much to yourself.  Double check the times and try and catch a lecture and for sure hit the gift shop.  The prices are super reasonable and you get one of a kind ""souvenirs"" that you can say you picked up while you and Indiana Jones were tooling around.  Unless you get to the British Museum in London often.....this is worth it!!!!!!",Oriental Institute Museum,February 2016,40
Great Collection.,JesseWhite,"My wife and I stopped in on an overnight trip to the city in celebration of our 6th wedding anniversary. I expected to pay admission as indicated by their website, but it is actually a suggested donation. We never carry cash, so if you are going, bring a cash donation. We will next time. The exhibit was easy to navigate, there were great informational signage, and even more remarkable artifacts. We would encourage you to visit.",Oriental Institute Museum,August 2016,40

Aladdin 2017,Katie C,"My parents, husband, niece, and I saw ""Disney's Aladdin"" at the Cadillac Palace Theatre. The venue is beautiful, and the show was spectacular. My friend played the Genie and slayed it, and the rest of the cast members were excellent as well. The staff of the Palace Theatre has the process of getting audience members in the door and to their seats down much better than many Broadway theaters do, and the rows are much roomier than in most Broadway theaters. The tickets were reasonably priced.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,July 2017,50
Save your money,P888UZjeffl,"Pretty disappointed in this show.  Very much geared for kids (yes, it follows the movie).  The performances were good, but nothing great.  It was kind of like watching a college performance.  Everything was good/fine, but nothing stellar... singing, dancing, acting.  I can't give you one performance that was remarkable.  And while kids would probably like it, it's WAY too expensive to be ""average.""  Save your money (unless you can find a ""Buy 1, Get 3 Free"" offer) and rent the movie for the babysitter to watch with the kids at home and then go see a better play.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,August 2017,30
Huge clean convention center,SkysMommy4,"Very nice modern convention center. Plenty of Bathrooms but make sure you wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking a lot. No good food, Starbucks packed with a line of 17 people throughout the shows. Nothing healthy to eat. ",McCormick Place,June 2017,50
"An outstanding convention center, with plenty of space and resources",Gabriel H,"McCormick Place is probably the largest convention center in the country and building continues to expand it further. It also offers the advantage of being located in a city with plenty of hotel space, so conventions exceeding 100,000 conventioneers can be easily accommodated. The building is modern, up to date and offers multiple rooms of various sizes, including four very large lecture halls that each accommodate >5,000 persons. There are food courts located at different levels and in different areas of the Convention Center. Shuttle access to and from various parts of the city bypasses city traffic to a large extent. Audiovisual equipment is modern and works flawlessly.",McCormick Place,June 2017,50

Small but Got the Job Done,GrandCayman123,"As Hilton Honors members,  we stayed for free at the Hampton Inn which is connected to the theater.  Since my daughter was on crutches and a medical boot, it was very handy there is a door in the hotel which lets you into the theater  lobby, by passing the crowd outside.  You still have to battle the crowd, once through the connector door.   The theater is really small.  Once you are seated, it really does not matter.   We sat main floor, second to last row. There were several pillars and a sound system right behind us but, we felt we had a very good view.   Yes, the women's restroom had a long line at intermission but, what theater does not have everyone jump up at intermission?  I waited until the second half started and used the restroom.  Restroom was very clean.   Staff was very friendly.  Yes, programs and alcoholic drinks were pricey but were right in line with other theater type pricing.   My daughter thoroughly enjoyed Hamilton there.  For all she cared, she could have sat on a folding chair, as long as the play was good.   Go see the show, you will not regret it!!",CIBC Theatre,August 2018,50
"Saw Hamilton, Lovely theatre",Margaret S,"We sat in the mezzanine, right side, seats 6 and 8 (adjacent even though numbered as if they aren't). GREAT view! The two seats next to us, 10 and 12, are considered obstructed but the people there said those were also fantastic. The theatre is lovely, old and pretty and we had zero complaints.",CIBC Theatre,March 2019,50
Beautiful theater,EllieMaze,"First time to CIBC to see Hamilton. If you’re on somewhat of a budget for tickets, I’d suggest viewing the theater on You Tube to get a feel for the balcony and restricted view seats. Not too many “bad” seats, but the side balcony seats do not offer a full stage view. You may lose full visibility of one side of the stage. Doesn’t really impair the enjoyment of the play.",CIBC Theatre,April 2019,50
Excellent museum,meshef,We were in the Hyde park area; strolling along the university campus when we came across this wonderful museum and decided to enter.

We didn't have any cash (oops) so we bought a bunch of stuff from the gift shop and then had them put an extra donation on the debit card. Gift shop is very reasonable- I got a pair of earrings for $6, some soap from Syria for about $4, and a few books. Definitely take a few minutes to just browse in there!",Oriental Institute Museum,March 2017,50

Beautiful show in an awesome theater,Cannuck1964,"Alladin was an an amazing show and the Cadillac Palace Theatre  was equally beautiful. The sound was just perfect, it felt slightly cold during the show (bring a sweater) but overall it was a really good experience. Parking is abundant in the area, but of course price will depend on how long you leave your car parked and which day of the week it is (weekends are cheaper).",Cadillac Palace Theatre,August 2017,50
Aladdin was Perfect!,cdeems,Came here on a Friday night with my wife and another couple. The show is absolutely amazing. We sat in the Dress Circle with a perfect view.

Must see for those raised in Chicago area in the 1960s!!!,maryd548,"We loved this museum!!! The 2nd floor was dedicated to radio throughout the decades and had plaques for announcers placed in their hall of fame. 3rd floor had the original costumes, puppets and videos from Bozo's Circus, Ray Raynor and Cuddley Dudley, BJ and Dirty Dragon - so great to see these wonderful childhood memories!! There were also video exhibits on memorable TV throughout the decades. If you grew up watching any of these shows, it will bring back such warm memories!",Museum of Broadcast Communications,June 2017,50
Too expensive to justify,midwestDee,"While the museum does have several exhibits that those of us that grew up in the area are quite nostalgic about, the expense of visiting must be considered. It cost $12 for each of us and parking in the nearby garage was over $20 for a 2 hours at best stay. Definitely, don't bring children here! Even teenagers or young adults would be bored to death without a suitable bribe. At this point of time, given  the limited number and nature of the exhibits and the expense involved, I personally would not recommend this museum.",Museum of Broadcast Communications,June 2017,20
So Much More Could Be Done,NikkiK634,"I loved the TV in the 90s exhibit and the Radio Hall of Fame and I very glad I went, but if you don't have have an affinity for those things, or are from Chicago, this museum may not be very interesting. I imagine most children would be very bored.  The biggest disappointment  was that they were setting up for a wedding and blocking the Svengoolie exhibit.  It was strange to have people running around setting up while trying to enjoy the museum.  There's so much more that could be done with a museum dedicated to this type of content, and much better merchandise they could get for their shop.",Museum of Broadcast Communications,July 2017,30
Great place to visit for 2 hours in the River North area,GolfJim,"We took a chance on this spot and were we glad that we did. We happened to enter with a group of students so we tagged along on their tour, led by Steve, the curator. Our tour lasted about 80 minutes but Steve talked with us afterwards. They have some amazing exhibits, especially concerning radio and television. Actual brief broadcasts of the Kennedy assassination, the Challenger explosion, and 911. Other films which we didn't see. Steve did a marvelous job and the entire experience brought back a flood of memories as we experienced most of these people and moments. Probably not for young children or even young adults although our group seemed to like it. Definitely recommend.",Museum of Broadcast Communications,August 2017,50

"Off the beaten path, but very worthwhile",PattyC37,"Visited this museum on a recent trip with friends to the Windy City. One of our group was a radio geek, and his wife had suggested this as a fun, afternoon diversion. The exhibit currently showing was related to producing the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. The 3rd floor of the museum was devoted entirely to Television and a large portion to Johnny Carson memorabilia: Several of Johnny's costumes for various skits, his make-up kit--EVEN his Rolodex, which was open to Elizabeth Taylor. Lots of interactive areas where you could listen and watch various portions of the show. Our group grew up on the era when Carson was King of Late Night and we thoroughly enjoyed this exhibit. The 2nd floor is entirely devoted to radio, with some cool exhibits there--lots of old ""tube-style"" radios and AM radios from the 50's, as well as Edgar Bergen's puppets and Charlie McCarthy's little wooden Oscar. A little before our time, but classic radio and fun to see. Not a great museum for kids, as I think they would not really related to it, but if you enjoy classic TV and Radio you would thoroughly enjoy it. Reasonable cost, and do-able in a couple hours.",Museum of Broadcast Communications,January 2017,40
Mildly interesting,victor408,"If you are old enough this museum provides many memories from  radio and television.

Walk down memory lane ,Ann B,Such fun looking at all the old radio and TV memorabilia.   The fact that we recalled so much of it gives away our age but I think younger people would also enjoy learning the history of mediums they now take for granted.

Disappointing,tkitts,"I was hoping for more.  My son and I had some time to kill and we thought this might be fun but it was really a poor attempt to capture the great history of radio and television.  I suppose if you were a native of Chicago this might be more relevant, with the local shows featured prominently.  But the rest of the exhibits suffered.  There was a tribute exhibit to The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson that was mildly interesting.

Loved the SNL exhibit ,dej05,My husband and I spent the weekend in Chicago for our anniversary.  I was looking for something of interest to do that would appeal to both of us.  I discovered the SNL exhibit through online research and we decided to give it a try.  We weren't disappointed!  The exhibit was well done and offered something for everyone...from the avid SNL fan to those of us who love to see the history of some of the greatest comedians ever (even if you've never watched SNL).  I would allow about 1 1/2 hours for the experience.  We got to the museum around 10am and didn't have to wait in line.

"Loved the SNL exhibit, but the permanent museum is just ok. Pricey",Lindsay C,"As big SNL fans making a weekend trip to Chicago for a concert, we made time in our day to stop into the museum of broadcast communications to check it out. I was a little shocked at the price. It was $25 a person which is pretty steep for the size of the museum and exhibit. The exhibit itself was great, lots of really popular memorabilia, but it wasn't super lengthy. Probably took us an hour to go through it all. Which is perfectly fine, but then maybe it should be $15. After the SNL exhibit, we made our way up to the permanent museum featuring items from old tv like the Bozo show and other scary, old-timey tv characters. As 30 somethings, my husband and I made our way out of there pretty quick. Overall, the SNL exhibit is really great so if money is no issue, then definitely check it out.",Museum of Broadcast Communications,December 2017,40
SNL exhibit ,rcw923,"I enjoyed the SNL exhibit but I was not impressed by the rest of the museum. It seemed like it was geared towards locals of a certain age. The rest of the museum was just not relevant to me. The SNL exhibit, on the other hand, was very interesting.

SNL Exhibit plus Kennedy-Nixon Debate,227karenl,"The SNL exhibit is tons of fun, way more than we expected. You get to walk through two floors of SNL memorabilia and you can sit on the couch in Wayne's World etc. At the end, you can sit in a fake Studio 8H and watch a short show that looks like the live broadcast hosted by Tine Fey. Way cool. Afterwards, you can stop on the 3rd floor to see the regular exhibit on broadcasting which is slanted towards children's shows. But they have a documentary on the Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960 that changed presidential politics forever (I'm a political science major, and this was HUGE for me). I didn't realize that the debate was broadcast live from Chicago CBS station, and that very camera is in the studio along with several photos and interpretive information.",Museum of Broadcast Communications,December 2017,50
Total Money Grab!!!,chrishY5418YN,"I am huge SNL fan and found this to be one of the biggest rip off's I have ever experienced. If it was $10 a person it may be ok, but $25 a person and it was like a cheesy high school tour of pictures and snip its of skits. One room was so warm they had a person standing by in case someone fainted from the heat. Would discourage folks from going. Sad",Museum of Broadcast Communications,December 2017,10
Bring water!,Katlarko,"If you go on a warm day there is little to no shade, so plan accordingly. Multiple places to enter and exit the trail as you wish. ",The 606,June 2015,40
Great start for an urban trail - more work needs to be done,ChicagoFamilyGuy,"In June Chicago's 2.6 mile 606 Trail opened on a disused freight rail line.  It is the only trail in the city that goes east west without dealing with any road traffic and as such is a boon for walkers, cyclists and runners.  It ties together gentrified neighborhoods such as Bucktown and Wicker Park with Humboldt - a neighborhood that has traditionally been Puerto Rican but is now very much of a melting pot.  Not all the plantings are in, some of the fences and handrails are temporary and the irrigation is functional only in part ... so hoping the trail will soon be fully realized.   The on and off ramps allow one to explore lots of green spaces, distinct neighborhoods and engage in some shopping and interesting eating (particularly off the Damen, Milwaukee and Western ramps).  The 606 offers a new way of seeing parts of Chicago that have been off the tourist track.  While there are a handful of water fountains on the trail there are no toilets so plan accordingly.",The 606,July 2015,40
Urban garden pathway,MRO,"The Chicago 606 opened in June and is the latest rail to trail pathway.  The trail accommodates everyone and is accessible to those with disabilities.  There is a jogging lane, bikes and dogs are permitted.  Be aware there are no restrooms on the path.",The 606,June 2015,50
Good use of abandoned train tracks,Mary jane R,"We went on a cloudy day. There is no shade so if you go on a sunny/hot day, it would be unbearable. There isn't any parking; no washroom facilities. I believe that it had ramps to enter.",The 606,June 2015,30
Wish every city had paths like this!,luciennemay,"When our hosts mentioned that we should take a walk on the 606, I first thought they meant a highway and I was a bit boggled.  But the real 606 is a converted elevated train track that is now a paved walkway complete with entrance/exit ramps off to popular streets and neighborhoods and at least one spider & butterfly themed playground.  This is SUCH a nice way to spend an afternoon, and a great alternative to taking the L to get to your destination.  You don't notice the cars and the traffic at all as it's below you, and everyone seemed polite about sharing the space - rollerskaters, bikers, walkers, kids, dogs.  Good work Chicago!",The 606,July 2015,50
"Always a unique, amazing experience!",Catie Walsh H,"I have been to several shows at Lookingglass and they continue to amaze me.  Whether it be an adaption, or an original play, it is always captivating and engaging.  They create an intimate experience with only 200 seats total, so you feel like you are a part of the show.  Every show creates a conversation that lasts weeks.  The artists are true professionals that create unique experiences each and every night.  One of my favorite parts of Lookingglass is that I always feel like I am a part of their home enjoying a performance that was created just for me.  This is definitely a hidden gem in the water pumping station on Michigan Avenue.  For years I didn't even know it was there.  Run out to see a show now!  I just saw 20,000 Leagues under the Sea!",Lookingglass Theatre Company,June 2018,50
"20,000 Leagues under the Sea at Lookingglass Theatre",marcx2,"What an amazing performance on such a small stage. So close to the actors, almost makes you part of the play. I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago this summer.  A must see.",Lookingglass Theatre Company,June 2018,50
"Mirror, mirror on the wall...",Ronjill,"whose the best theater of all! For it's edgy, original and creative productions, Looking glass is the standard in Chicago.

We are great fans of Andrew and Lookingglass and always will be.",Lookingglass Theatre Company,June 2018,50
rides disappointing,lovetoskate,"I'm extremely  near sighted, they made me take off my glasses for the virtual reality ride, everything was blurry.  The rides are super expensive, if they are not going to let you wear glasses, they should say so before you buy a ticket!!!  Rides are very expensive.",Navy Pier,October 2019,20
Fun place ,776rajatd,"The place is beautiful, from all aspects. The entrance is like a red brick structure and once you are in, they have lots of places to shop from and there’s a food court as well. As you go up one floor (on stairs or elevator), there is a beautiful garden with fountains and trees and it’s enclosed under glass. Once you’re out, you have the giant Ferris wheel, which is mind blowing, a place to play some 3D stuff and a carousel. There is a place for a revolving swing but I don’t have the courage to sit on those things. Nice place, breezy, good food and nice time to be spent with yourself and yours.",Navy Pier,October 2019,50
Good for a stroll about,ChucknJen,We walked about and checked out Navy Pier over the course of an hour or so.  There’s plenty to do if you were to eat.  It’s fun to walk the boardwalk and check out the ships on the docks. ,Navy Pier,October 2019,40
splendid facility that provides a unique view to the city,louisd789,"Attended a conference that took place a the end of the Navy Pier. What struck me was the unique view to the city from this vantage point. It was a mild fall day, sunny at the outset and raining in the afternoon. A pleasant stop and a unique location for a conference event.",Navy Pier,October 2019,50
Good views,Amandamonkey,Navy pier is a bit under whelming. There’s not exactly too much to do. There are a few sovereign shops & eatery’s but in the whole just a pier. Nice views. ,Navy Pier,May 2019,30
Monstrosity,TyPlanter,"Too large, hard to get oriented.  Signage poor. Virtually no food choices, forcing us to UBER to Chinatown.  Unbelievable that they can't get some local merchants in there - think they'd make a killing.  Room set up was poor, with some sessions too packed and others in rooms far oversized.  One room I was moderating didn't even have a mic for me, no tech help in sight for missing presentations.  Would avoid this venue at all costs. ",McCormick Place,May 2017,10
excellent place,Jackordaz,"excellent place for a expo, little far from downtown but well located for public transportation has a hotel nearby",McCormick Place,July 2017,50
Huge place with poor guidance ,nikoin79,"Very huge complex. One might think the sign and guidance would be properly done, but no. Not that easy approach, quite a distance to the city center. Not my favorite exhibition hall. ",McCormick Place,September 2017,30
The Book House and Some of the Buzz on the Last Frontier,MaryinChicago,"This library can be visited for its architectural design and its large book and information collection.  In addition, the library center also presents lectures and discussions.  For $3.00 last June I had the rare opportunity during the Printers Row Lit Fest to listen to one of the few men alive who has walked on the moon.  Buzz Aldrin in conversation with Christina Korp discussed his latest book and his life.  This was a fascinating afternoon especially with the forward looking part about travel to Mars.  I applaud everyone who allowed this to happen.",Harold Washington Library Center,June 2016,50

Fantastic old library,andnobodyknows,"I was in Chicago for a visit and needed to get some work done, so I spend much of the day in the Harold Washington Library.  It's a beautiful old building, both inside and out, with tons of great places to sit.  If I had had time, I could have taken advantage of all kinds of amenities and facilities, but even though I didn't do that it was perfect for what I needed.",Harold Washington Library Center,March 2017,50
You get what you pay for!,Bruce H,"The most inexpensive tickets for Hamilton anywhere was in Chicago. So we booked online and got tickets in the Dress Circle Right. Good price however at aisle F you could only see the main stage and only legs on the upper part of the stage. Sound was great but when you can't see whose singing it's a problem. Overall we loved it but will pay more the next time. I would guess that if you are in rows a-c you can probably see the entire stage, After that, people in front of you and the upper deck block your view. Also, RUN not walk to the restrooms at intermission, the lines are huge and the restrooms are small.",CIBC Theatre,May 2019,30
Hamilton,kevin P,We went to see Hamilton Saturday May 11th in the show was fantastic definitely a must-see. Cast was awesome the whole show was worth seeing and I would definitely go again. We did balcony seats which were reasonably priced and the only issue that I had a problem with was the $56 convenience fee or processing fee that they had. When you click on the explanation it says to help give you a better experience. As far as that fee is concerned either put it in the price of a ticket or take it off completely I think it's just a way to up there per ticket cost. That being said the show was definitely worth seeing,CIBC Theatre,May 2019,40
Just like Broadway,JRsNeighbor,We decided to see Hamilton in Chicago versus Dallas because of the pricey. The theater is standard old school Broadway. It's old and nostalgic making it very cool. Don't expect fancy and modern when you walk in. We were in the top balcony which was still very comfortable to enjoy the show.,CIBC Theatre,May 2019,50
HIDDEN GEM IN HYDE PARK,bonnie h,"Anyone who is interested in History or Middle Eastern artifacts will find a treasure trove in this little known museum.  Right in the beautiful U of C campus. These are the treasures that Howard Carter(discoverer of the treasures of King Tutankhamen)brought to America.  The museum includes artifacts from all parts of the middle East. The artifacts range in size from the minuscule to the colossal(massive stone bull sculptures)Every thing is well organized and informative.  They have one of the best permanent Ancient Egyptian collections to be found.  This is not a dusty dark museum, it is a light spacious museum with state of the art interactive media.They have lectures and programs.  They have movies and special programs for teachers and children. They also have a gift shop called The Souk which I usually visit to get my inexpensive Jewelry fix on. ",Oriental Institute Museum,March 2017,40

Fascinating and arcane,Hakluyt,"We used the audio guide via an Ipod which I have to admit was not very user-friendly, and a coffee machine would have been nice for when our heads were full of archaeology, but apart from that we had a wonderful time.",Oriental Institute Museum,September 2017,50
Grand Old Theatre.,birtleman,We saw Irving Berlin's White Christmas which was a great production.  The theatre is very ornate and very clean and well maintained.

Love seeing shows at this theater,tangokilo12,"We see most shows that come to Chicago, and it's always a pleasure to see them at beautiful The Cadillac Palace Theater. The seats are much more comfortable than some other theaters in Chicago, and there is much more leg room, too.  Additionally, the temperature in the theater is kept at much more comfortable level than others, which is a bonus.  The theater is nicely appointed, and the staff are always friendly and willing to provide aasistance. ",Cadillac Palace Theatre,December 2017,50
It Rocks!,djz032070,"We love this theater!  It was very grand with high ceilings, columns and much marble.  We had a great view on the 2nd floor right up front and center.  It just feels grand and opulent.  The seats, however, were uncomfortable...small and lightly cushioned.  Prices are typical, way overpriced.  School Of Rock was fantastic!!!",Cadillac Palace Theatre,November 2017,40
Palace Playing Beautiful,irina g,"There were some singular miscasts, and some stretching pauses and poor sound projection in low-action dialogues.  I am sure, it can easily be corrected. Overall, this colorful show justifiably got genuine appreciation from the audience and big rounds of applause. It is a well-staged, high-quality production, and our whole group enjoyed Beautiful very much!",Cadillac Palace Theatre,December 2017,50
"Beautiful Theater, Great Show",Tom A,"Visited theater this week for Beautiful. The theater itself is old style opulence, very ornate and enjoyable to visit. Now to Carol King musical Beautiful, got last minute discount tix through Hot Tix, a true bargain at $47 all in, main floor center 20 rows from stage.  An excellent show, led by Sarah Bockel and an excellent cast. Fantastic music that had the entire audience moving to the songs they have enjoyed over the past 50+ years.

SNL 5 star the rest not so much,BCombs67,"Visited for the SNL experience exhibit and was very impressed. Loved the amount of props and details from the show. Even how it was arranged for you to experience ""a week"" in the life of a show. Well worth seeing. The rest of the museum was mostly focused on Chicago area broadcasting and had limited appeal to someone outside the area. Not horrible, but nothing too attention grabbing. Visit before the SNL exhibit leaves.",Museum of Broadcast Communications,February 2018,50
Live from Chicago it's SNL,ChicagoScott1,"Great SNL exhibit with costumes, behind the scene info and props.  Very cool to see 40+ years of SNL.

SNL experience,katiel112,We happened upon this place while enjoying some night life near by. The SNL experience was amazing! It wasn’t crowded during the week and had all sorts of interesting information and artifacts. ,Museum of Broadcast Communications,March 2018,50
Fun for a local Chicagoan :),alwayswants2travel,"I thought this place was fun! In my opinion, this place is probably more enjoyed and appreciated by someone who grew up in the Chicago area (like myself). I say that because it seems the major attraction of this museum is the Bozo, Gar and Ray exhibits. The SNL exhibit was also fantastic! So many costumes, scripts and props to see. We really had a lot of fun!",Museum of Broadcast Communications,March 2018,50
worth checking out...,phantom12345,"this ""trail"" is fairly new...I am from California and it was written up in a local magazine, thus I decided to check it out.

"Beautiful Scenery - Heavily Trafficked with Walkers, Bikers, Skaters, Runners",Hans M,"I nice bike trail in the heart of the city.  However, it is not a fair description to call it a leisurely ride.  Walkers, moms with strollers, people stopped to look at the streets below make it a bike ride where you need to stay VERY focused on what you are doing.  This was my experience on a weekday at 10:30 AM.  I can't imagine what this path looks like during a weekend.  Well, I could guess and for sure I don't want to be there.  Having said all that, it was a good experience but not worth repeating coming from the north suburbs.",The 606,August 2015,30
Great for AM Leisure Cycling,luv2skiChicago,"My wife and I rented bikes form a nearby Divvy station for a nice ride up and down the 606.  Great views of neat homes at the Eastern end.  On the way back we took the ""exit"" for Milwaukee Avenue and dropped the bikes at a station to visit the Wicker Park neighborhood.  Just take it slow on the 606 - since it can get crowded.  If you've been to High Line in NYC, this is much narrower and not as nicely appointed.  But it's still pretty cool.",The 606,August 2015,50
The 606 Trail,Mary L,"An awesome addition to the city of Chicago! any runner for a visit must try this trail. It is an old railroad track that travels above a number of Chicago neighborhoods spanning from Ashland Ave to Lawndale Ave. From Bucktown to Humboldt Park. These areas are regentrifiying and worth the visit! The trail is 2.7 miles one way with a number of scenic stops along the way. So live in Chicago or just visiting it, the 606 is a must. Also if you exit at Damen and go North to Cortland Ave ,then East 1 block you can visit MOLLY's . The bar of THE CHICAGO FIRE tv show.:-)",The 606,August 2015,50

A different theater experience beyond our expectations,timmL7529VK,"While visiting Chicago, we had the opportunity to see a few shows.  In addition to seeing a few big shows, we wanted to see something different from our ordinary theater experiences.  After reading the description of the Lookingglass Theatre's approach, we decided to give 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea a try, and we were thrilled with the experience.  The intimacy of the being so close to the stage and actors was unlike anything we've experienced before, and even the kids were impressed.  We had a wonderful experience, and the cost was a fraction of the other shows we took in during our stay.  Unequivocal recommendation.",Lookingglass Theatre Company,June 2018,50

Loved the Dog Beach!,halfwitt,We took our daughter and her dog back to school in Chicago in August.  We were looking for some fun and inexpensive things to do and discovered Montrose Dog Beach!  We had our beagle with us too.  Our daughter's dog absolutely loved playing in the water with several other dogs.  The beagle isn't real sociable so she watched.  One thing that annoys me about dog parks is the inconsiderate people that do not clean up after their dogs - Montrose Dog Beach was very clean!  The beach is also very secure so there is no need to worry about your dog wandering off.,Montrose Beach,August 2015,40
One of the nicer Chicago beaches,Allen21096,"Montrose Beach is one of the largest and nicest beaches in Chicago.  It does not get nearly as crazy as North Ave. Beach and there is plenty of parking in the morning, at least.  It is also home to a dog beach and there is a bird sanctuary at the southern end, which bird lovers will enjoy.",Montrose Beach,July 2015,40

Dirty and disgusting beach,HoosierMama40,"This was our first experience with any of the Chicago beaches. The water was nice and clean but I was shocked and disgusted by how dirty the beach was. There was garbage everywhere. Dirty diapers were strewn by the boardwalk. I was so grossed out, I wouldn't even take off my shoes! I am used to the nice, sandy beaches of Michigan and Florida. This was a huge disappointment. This is our last trip to Chicago for the next 5 years, I am sure.",Montrose Beach,September 2015,20

Fabulous Small Theatre,Kristin M,"This is our second time to see a performance at Lookingglass.  We love this small theatre in a beautiful building.

There are many types of restaurants, attractions, and shops. There are indoor and outdoor dining facilities. There  are sections that are indoors and there is the outdoor walk along the lake. It would be easy to spend the entire day visiting.",Navy Pier,October 2019,50
First Time Navy Pier Visit,Karen F,It was defintely a cool place and I would recommend it for 1st time Chicago visitors! The famous Ferris Wheel is a MUST - views and experience are worth it!!

It was cold so that didn't help but it's an historic Chicago spot so do it but you may not need that much time there.,Navy Pier,October 2019,40
The Lake and Boardwalk,Vinay M,Magnificent view of the Lake and city lights. Very nice walk with good eating places. The ongoing construction makes it look bit ugly. We visited Offshore Rooftop bar. Very nice happening place.,Navy Pier,October 2019,40
"Great place to visit, less dining choices",rx92700,"Great place to visit while in the Chicago area especially when entertaining friends from out of town (country).

FUN!!,STrezise,"Back from the international housewares show.... what a fabulus place for a convention. Great to be able to stay in a nice hotel (Hyatt Regency) attached to the Convention Center, so did not have to brave the WIndy City!

LIVE Reggae at Montrose Beach every Wednesday during the summer!,lugan7,"JamDock Reggae Wednesdays take place every Wednesday at The Dock @ Montrose Beach during the summer months.

This is a seasonal event and runs from the end of May to the beginning of October. The Dock has a large patio with a full restaurant and bar. You can either hang out on the patio which fits about 400 people or you can just hang out on the beach and vibe out. The coolest thing about this unique experience is that it is FREE, all ages, and family friendly. DJ Shottas, a local rising star, is the captain of the ship.",Montrose Beach,June 2015,50

Came to see Hamilton - Great Views,Jeff P,"If you're coming to CIBC, it's likely to see Hamilton. This was our first time to this Theatre, and I have nothing but positive things to say about the process of getting in, getting to our seats and, most importantly, the sightlines and sound system. All were as you'd want them to be. I liked the location relative to our hotel and what we wanted to see while in Chicago. I'd definitely come back for another show here.",CIBC Theatre,May 2019,50
Hamilton and History,Global275990,"We loved Hamilton of course. Everyone does. But our experience was enhanced by experiencing the play in this beautiful setting.

Intimate theatre with difficulty leaving the dress circle,jppalooza,"This theatre is very basic.  However, we had tickets in the dress circle and there was one way up and one way down for everyone....which was probably easily over 250 people.  It took quite a while for all of us to file out.  Yes, there are 4 emergency exits for fire in that area, but just don't be in a rush to leave after the show or try to use the restroom at intermission. Not much of a gathering space in the lobby area. ",CIBC Theatre,June 2019,30
A Wealth of Knowledge,aaronm243,"My teenagers learned much about the Ancient Near East and enjoyed the museum. There is much reading to do, but the writing is accessible and you can learn so much.

Lovely nigh at the theater,Corine S,My husband and I were born and raised in Chicago. We live in the suburbs now and rarely get to the theater. We planned an evening out for dinner and a show. We saw Love Never Dies - the sequel to the Phantom of the Opera. We were very impressed with the architecture of this Chicago treasure. It is a wonderful venue for a musical.

The sets and costumes, acting and singing blended with professional orchestra was a winning combination for a delightful night out.

"An Awesome day with ""Love Never Dies""",elephanttrkker,Andrew Lloyd Webber's sequel of Phantom of the Opera was absolutely fantastic.  The music and production was superb.  The story was very easy to follow.  Took our 13 year old grand twins girls.  We watched the movie of Phantom before going to the theater so they could better follow the story.  Plus listened to the music so they were better prepared to catch all the details.   Catch this show as it travels around the US -- going to San JOse and LAs Vegas next,Cadillac Palace Theatre,March 2018,50
SNL Event at Museum of Broadcast Communications,rdbrooke,"There are 2 floors worth of SNL interactive media and displays.  Most wigs/costumes from the early days.  Video clips.  Discussion of how the writers come up with stories and how they hope to get their bit aired.  A third floor has much of the radio and TV equipment from days gone by.  Also, old commercials and TV shows.  I really enjoy seeing the evolution of the equipment.

You can hop on or off at any of about a dozen stops and enjoy what each neighborhood has to offer. This really is one of the best FREE things we have going on in the city.

All tenderly cared for by the Friends of the Park.  The beach is HUGE!  And shallow so families can frolic in the surf...even with little ones.  Bring sun screen and a picnic.  And, if you are lucky, you may get to sample some of the amazing rancheros grilling all over the place.  Very diverse and fascinating view of how Chicagoans spend a Sunday afternoon.  And the view of downtown Chicago from the seawall is breathtaking.  Easy bike ride up the lake from downtown.  About 5 miles...and every step of the way offers a real visual treat.

Cheeky and Wonderful ,alleyraven,"I recently saw Lookingglass’ adaptation of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Cheeky, sympathetic, funny and adventurous, the play was wholly engaging from beginning to end. The set was a marvel of creative ingenuity and engineering that did its job, and left plenty of space for the imagination. Lighting and effects were equally accomplished. The cast put energy and life into a well crafted script. All the actors were good to superb. Not a week link in the entire cast. The techs in the booth were spot on.

Chicago at it's best,Scott S,"As a born Chicago native you grow up with the Pier as a part of your life.  Always bringing visitors, family or tourists to its doors.   It has always been great and now it is becoming more of an attraction again for locals.  Bringing the local flavors of Chicago dining and drinking, theater, and fun to the Pier.

Maybe not a tourist trap after all,AlexB10499,"You could make the case that Navy Pier is Chicago’s biggest tourist trap if you wanted (and I heard things to this effect a few times during my trip to Chicago), but I’m not sure that it meets my criteria. The Pier is Chicago’s most visited site and is home to a few significant permanent attractions, like the Children’s Museum, the Shakespeare Theater, and the Ferris wheel, all of which I would say are perfectly legitimate attractions. If anything, people probably view Navy Pier as a tourist trap because it’s a place many tourists want to see, and because of that you’ll find some standard gift shops and trinket-sellers whose presence you associate with tourist traps. I may not be the best judge of this, because I visited the Pier at night, when many of the stores were closed and the crowds were gone. What I can say for sure is that it’s an ideal place to cool off on a warm night – the Pier sticks more than half a mile out into the lake, and the cooling breezes sweep right off the surface of the water. With great views of the city skyline to boot, I would probably encourage any first-time visitor to stop by the Pier at some point.",Navy Pier,September 2019,40

The actor did a great job of staying in character.  I was not impressed with the usher coming by 2 times to retrieve the shoe, it was distracting and people pay a lot of money for the show.

My favorite beach in Chicago ,thesrivastavaji,"During Summers this beach comes to life and enjoys with the people visiting it. The beach is well maintained and can host thousand of people. The water here is very clear and the shore is pretty long to enjoy with family and friends. On a very good sunny day you can spent your whole day here. Reaching here should not be problem, the public transport will make you walk at least half a mile, while a taxi and uber can bring you pretty close to beach. This beach hosts many annual feats and function. I will recommend this beach for couples, families, dogs and what not. Go and enjoy with it.",Montrose Beach,July 2016,50
More Chiacgo feel,katherine c,"In my opinion better than some of the other beach farther south.  This baech offers a little more Chiacgo culture and has a cute place for drinks at eats at the Dock.  Dog friendly as well, there is often live music. ",Montrose Beach,July 2016,40
Great beach,BruceM285,"We came here because a friend recommended it to me. We needed to kill a little time and were traveling through Chicago with our tent trailer and two dogs. There is an awesome dog beach there which is all fenced off and leach free. Parking was easy and didn't cost anything. After some beach time we visited a restaurant at the other end of the beach which was also dog friendly with water dishes for the dogs. It is easy to get to as well, just get off 41 at Wilson and your there basically.",Montrose Beach,July 2016,50
Excellent Theater Experience,Walt3667,"Saw the production 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea at a matinee production and found it to be excellent.

fun time,epichon,We saw Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It was a very fun experience. My Son who is 13 very much enjoyed the performance. I liked the intimate aspect of the theater. It was quite well staged. I was especially impressed with the use of puppets in the story line. I also thought adding the female perspective made it fresh.,Lookingglass Theatre Company,September 2018,50
Excellent little theater,480jay,"We loved every minute of ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea."" This was the second time we've included the Lookingglass Theatre in a Chicago visit. Both productions provided an original, well performed experience. Previously, we saw ""Treasure Island."" My wife and I are long-time, frequent visitors to Stratford, Ontario, where we take in multiple plays per visit. Their production of ""Treasure Island"" a couple of years ago wasn't nearly as good as the production put on by Lookingglass.

Fun place to visit but the parking lot is horrendous,amanda7200,"I love Navy Pier, go every year. The Wild Jet boat ride is my favorite thing and every one should do it. The fireworks are also awesome. Its a great place to people watch, such a variety of cultures and people it's fantastic. The views are fantastic and there's always something to do and great food and drink. However... They MUST fix the parking garage situation and elevators! We are owed this as Navy Pier is no cheap place to visit and parking is very expensive and so we deserve to be able to pay at each level and on the way out without hassel and we deserve elevators that function. Be prepared if you park at Navy Pier, which I recommend you do NOT park at Navy Pier, but if you do, expect to walk flights and flights of stairs at the end of your day to get to your car, or wait for up to 30 mins for an elevator that may not even be working.",Navy Pier,July 2019,40

Best show at a beautiful old theater in the heart of the Windy City,154patriciaa,"Hamilton! Finally & fabulous! Need I say more? And the fact that it was in the 1,800-seat CIBC Theater in the downtown Loop just added to a wonderful experience.

World Class Archeological Museum.,Lance H,The Oriental Institute is truly a world class Archeological Museum. The collection is overwhelming in it's scope and quality. A Chicago must see!!!!,Oriental Institute Museum,July 2018,50
I'm really here!!!,John G,"Great museum divided into regions and organized within each division by theme and period of time.  Some of the large stone sculptures are very impressive.  After about three hours straight the exhibits start to become less distinct.  It would be even better, if they had a way to connect the divisions through culture or language.  It would also be nice to have seen more on languages than just Summerian and Akkadian and how the people migrated.  Nonetheless, the museum is not too large (e.g., it's not as physically large as the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History), offers a lot of unique material and information, and is clean and temperate.  If you like museums and anthropology, you will be very glad you visited here ",Oriental Institute Museum,August 2018,50
Unusual collection,Chuck_Ma,I have been here several times and each time I notice things I missed.  This is a relatively small museum but the collection is unique and very interesting.  You can tour it in a few hours & it is time well spent.,Oriental Institute Museum,August 2018,50

We loved everything about it--the music,the acting,the storyline.  It was funny,heart warming and entertaining.  We loved it as much as Hamilton and it's only a fraction of the price.  If you have a chance to see it don't pass it up.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,July 2018,50
Good Theatre,taylorashby,"Overall this theatre brings in a variety of shows every year with generally good casting and selection. The seats themselves are spacious for an older theater, and there is plenty of legroom in between the rows of seating - particularly in the orchestral section. Bring a sweater, the theatre is kept on the chillier side for the performers but overall very comfortable. Seating on the upper decks is more cramped, but manageable. Young children are not admitted to many shows, but because these are full length theatrical productions that is understandable. Seating in the orchestra section or on the main floor is accessible without stairs. Hearing aids are provided, and the ushers are more than happy to assist those who might want assistance finding there seat. The dress code varies slightly based on time of show (afternoons are more casual than evenings) but generally speaking no one is turned away. Most people wear jeans and a nice top as the low end and dress up slightly in dresses/skirts with flats or maybe a pair of low heels in the evenings.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,July 2018,40
A walk down memory lane,mym2bw,"Full disclosure, my husband and I only went to the SNL experience. I am a pretty big fan, and so I enjoyed just about every minute of it. The experience walks you through a week of creating a show and then the experience of a live show. The memorabilia and information about the behind-the-scenes development of the show was the best part of the experience. The “actual show” was probably the most lame, although I adore Tina Fey. For me, SR and now it’s a lot like listening to old music. It immediately takes me back to the time and place I first saw that particular show. Four generations of my family love the show, starting with my dad and I watching it when I was 10 and culminating now with my 15-year-old grandson loving it. The tickets are high at $25 apiece, and if you can find a Groupon or another discount way to purchase them I would recommend it. But to a fan, it is a fun and memorable adventure.",Museum of Broadcast Communications,September 2018,50
"Not bad, SNL is interesting!",305KMD,"The regular collection the other floor is kind cool - definitely go if you love tv shows. Not near as interactive as SNL.  Mostly reading and walking around, but you can see some Seinfeld stuff, some Simpsons stuff and some puppets, as well as cool older video cameras and tv floor models.

Recycling at its best!,Samanta E,This walkway above the city has been re-purposed from old railway tracks.  It's only about two and a half miles long but I think it is lovely to get a different perspective in the city.  Great way to swap between the neighbourhoods and I imagine it will improve massively as time goes on and all the plants and trees grow and flourish.

Walk Above the Traffic,ReyNardG,"A former elevated rail line converted into a combination walking, jogging, biking path.  Well landscaped.  It is an out and back straight walk if you stay on the path - 5.4 miles (2.7 miles each way) if you do the whole trail.  Also called the Bloomingdale trail by some locals.  Some parks are accessible off the trail, but there are no restrooms.  The designated walking areas are two narrow strips on the lateral edges, so be careful about speeding bikes when you spread out a little if walking with a group of two or more.  Several areas have small oases off the path with benches.  A great way to get some exercise away from car traffic in the Bucktown/Logan Park area.",The 606,May 2017,50
Nice autumn walk on Lake Michigan,GreenKona,"With its sandy area approximately 1km long and up to 200m wide this beach offers enough space for many visitors but also for different sport activities. We were there on a sunny September day and we saw lot of dog owners and several people taking a walk. The water was already too cold for swimming and water sports. Although it probably looks much better in summer and is a great relief for citizens of Chicago on hot days, in autumn, it does not score much more than average. If you walk further south toward Montrose Harbour, you will be awarded a magnificent view on Chicago skyline in the distance.",Montrose Beach,September 2015,30
Nice expansive stretch of beach along the lake,mooresy2,This beach has a section where dog owners do take their dogs but for the most part this section of the lake front has a very nice expansive sandy area for laying out or people watching.  There are facilities that are open in the summer and can get very crowded in Summer.  ,Montrose Beach,October 2016,40

Interesting makers lab!,sarahe832,"I went here because my friend wanted to go when we visited the area so I dragged along. The main entranceway stank of urine but once you got further inside that was no longer noticeable. The winter garden was disappointing, there are a couple of trees & a lot of empty space but the makers lab was really impressive. I’ve never heard of these before but they had Cricut machines, 3D printers, sewing machines & various other things which you can use for free/very low charges. Staff on hand will help you with what you need & there’s a cool display of things that have been made there.

Focusing on artifacts related to ancient civilizations,Taylor B,"I love history, mostly Civil War history. But I minored in Ancient History at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign and have a large collection of books on ancient Greece, Egypt and Rome in my library. So you can imagine that I enjoy annual visits to the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago. Located at 1155 East 58th Street, it was established in 1919 as a research center for ancient Near Eastern studies and archaeology museum. Founded for the university by professor James Henry Breasted with funds donated by John D. Rockefeller Jr., it conducts research on ancient civilizations throughout the Near East, including at its facility, Chicago House, in Luxor, Egypt. The museum, on the southeast corner of 58th Street and University Avenue, east of the University Quadrangle, in the Hyde Park community, exhibits an extensive collection of artifacts related to ancient civilizations. In the early 20th century, Breasted dreamed of establishing a research institute, ""a laboratory for the study of the rise and development of civilization,"" that would trace Western civilization to its roots in the ancient Middle East. The Oriental Institute, housed in an unusual Art Deco/Gothic building that was dedicated in 1931, is the answer to Breasted's vision. The museum has artifacts from archeological digs in Egypt, Israel, Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran.  Notable works in the collection include the famous Megiddo Ivories; various treasures from Persepolis, the old Persian capital; a collection of Luristan Bronzes; a colossal 40-ton human-headed winged bull from Khorsabad, the capital of Sargon II; and a monumental statue of King Tutankhamun. In 2011, the scholars at the Oriental Institute completed publication of the 21-volume Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, a basic cultural reference work that was begun in 1921 by Breasted. One of the most fascinating objects on display are the Achaemenid clay tablets, from Persepolis, capital of the Achaemenid Empire, which were discovered by archaeologists in 1933 and date to about 500 BC. The tablets give a view of daily life, itemizing such elements as the daily rations of barley given to workers in nearby regions of the empire. Curiously, each tablet is about half the size of a deck of playing cards and has characters of a dialect of Elamite, an extinct language understood by perhaps a dozen scholars in the world. Fascinating stuff to a historian, a way of life at the Oriental Institute.",Oriental Institute Museum,November 2018,50

The museum hosts artifacts of the eastern civilization, and also hosts the famous Egyptian ""Book of the Dead"". It is not very large, so you won't get tired walking around the place, looking at artifacts.",Oriental Institute Museum,September 2018,50
"Ancient Babylon, Assyria and Egyptian history plus other lands!",raerav24,"Our friends brought us here after they had visited the prior week. It's a smaller museum focusing on ancient cultures and history from Bible times. We are Jehovah's Witnesses and our friends had taken a tour with one of our sisters from the area who gives the tour along with focusing on the scriptures and how this history relates. It is fascinating to say the least! The walls of Babylon where Daniel was. The statues of Sennacherib and the temple grounds of Assyria were fascinating. The old artifacts and seeing Jehovah's name on old tablets, so cool. It's just the right size museum too. Doesn't take very long to go through so you are not overwhelmed. Also, it's free! And in a beautiful area of the city, so pretty to just walk around the neighborhood there, too.",Oriental Institute Museum,November 2018,50
Thoughtful and profound,Patricia M,"Extensive display of collections. The garments. statues, swords and art works were just remarkable. Love this spot.",Oriental Institute Museum,February 2018,50
Yes Please!!!!,Kymm M,This Macy's inside of the Water Tower Place gave me life once again. We shopped in there for hours to the point where the other stores on the outside were closing. We went on every level of the store which has a lot of levels and had a field day. I can't wait to go back.,Water Tower Place,July 2018,50
Visit for American Girl and Lego store,MissBuffalo,"We visited Water Tower Place with the goal of shopping at the American Girl Store, dining at the American Girl café, and checking out the Lego store as well.  The mall was easy to find, seemed clean, and had everything that we were looking for.",Water Tower Place,July 2018,40
Not what we expected,DMJA21,"We literally hadn’t been here in years.  Our memory was of a high traffic, multi story, upscale mall.  When we were there on early Sunday afternoon the shopper traffic was pretty light, in sharp contrast to the crowded sidewalks on either side of Michigan Ave.  There was high occupancy on the 8 floors, but few of the upscale specialty shop names we expected to see.  It is no longer the destination mall it used to be.",Water Tower Place,July 2018,30
Not as I remember it!,ProfessorOT,We visited the Water Tower Place to shop at Macy's.  Our last visit focussed on shopping at the American Girl Store.  Macy's had some good sales and the store is well organized.  We enjoyed the water feature in the mall and the options for eating.,Water Tower Place,July 2018,30
Enjoyed our visit! ,Mlb4u31,We didn’t realize there was a mall on the mile until we were looking for a restroom and thought this was a food court to be surprised to find a 7 level mall! The mall is super unique with several levels and a unique mix of local and national stores. Lots of restaurant choices too. ,Water Tower Place,August 2018,40
Beautiful Chicago theater ,gretinad,"We came here for the first time and saw the broadway show Tootsie. The theater is beautiful, the staff attentive and helpful. Tootsie is a great show, this production was really outstanding. The actors were fantastic and the stage scenery was ornate and varied a lot. We really enjoyed the show, not a minute of boredom. The theater offers discount parking nearby, also lots of nice restaurants in the area.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,September 2018,50
Great Show,JustKelly2,"Saw Tootsie last weekend with my husband and our son, who lives in Chicago.  The Cadillac Palace Theatre is a beautiful theater. The show was great, very entertaining!  The seats were comfortable and even at the last minute we got seats for a reasonable price.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,September 2018,50
An impressive & iconic Chicago theatre,Allen21096,"If you only come to the Cadillac Palace Theatre, only to see the production, you are missing half of the beauty for the evening.  The Cadillac Palace Theatre is probably one of the most beautiful theatres in Chicago.  The architecture and the ornamentation is unbelievably grand.  The seats are comfortable and wider than most venues.  There are restrooms where you need them, stairways or elevators, coat room and concession stands.  The staff at the ticket window was very helpful in getting the tickets.  The in-house staff on the night of the production was also friendly and efficient.  One thing about the production that we went to, there is a strict rule about re-entering the theatre if you need to use the restroom that is enforced, though they have a large monitor in the lobby that you can watch until you go back in.  We saw ""Tootsie"" and it was an excellent and fun production.  Don't expect it to follow the movie exactly, as it is different - hope that is not a ""spoiler""!",Cadillac Palace Theatre,October 2018,50
Tootsie was Incredible! Not the best for young kids though,DSHBOLDLY,"We recently visited the Cadillac Palace Theatre for the new release of Tootsie. The theatre is stunning and seems to be right out of a Great Gatsby scene. It is worth seeing a show here at any point. We saw Tootsie, which was hysterical. But, there were some parts and language that seemed to be a little much for kids. We would go back and see it again. ",Cadillac Palace Theatre,October 2018,50
Palace for Tootsie,irina g,"So, if not for this show, the theater itself of course would've been rated as excellent, as it should be.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,October 2018,40
Harassed and racially profiled with my biracial children,concernedmom2boys,"We were just out to buy a Father's Day gift and spend time with family who were here for the National volleyball tournament at Navy Pier.  My teenage white niece was about 5 feet in front of my sister when we entered Water tower and she was not stopped by security while my biracial teen boys were right next to me and they were immediately stopped.  My children continued to be harassed and were stopped 5 times within 1 hour.  My niece decided to walk around by herself to see if anyone approached her and not one security officer said a word to her.  This is not security this is racial profiling and discrimination.  This is supposed to  be a world renowned city that wants to attract visitors from all over the world. I suggested to stay home.  I live here and it made me want to leave, so sad to say about an establishment in my own city.",Water Tower Place,June 2019,10
Shopping mall,AMohsen,"It is located in the already shopping location ""North Michigan Av. street"" and it contains additional stores like Adidas, the body shop, Sephora, pink, Victoria secrets, Lacoste, and many other stores.",Water Tower Place,May 2019,50

Good shopping mall,MrsWayfarer,I also liked the food shops and cafes here.,Water Tower Place,May 2018,30
Was okay but not thing to rave about,Whatup1989,"Let me say that we went here as a result of being rained out and needing something to do.  Was recommended this place and landed here.  The place is a big mall on several floors.  Depending on your preferences, you will be disappointed.  For people over 35, Macy’s is the main draw but everything else is primarily for 34 and under or people who want to manage that number.  Visited with family (two teenagers) and my daughter was the only person who got something...enough said.  ",Water Tower Place,June 2018,30
Welcome Summer!,barbaraw805,"Great day to shop (Monday) not crowded and fun for all. Took a 4, 16, 17 years old and they had a ball. Shopping, people watching and seeing all the new clothes for summer.",Water Tower Place,June 2018,40
Looking Glass Theatre,lorettamontelongo,We took my mother to the Looking Glass theatre to celebrate her birthday.  This was our first time.  The venue is small and intimate.  It was amazing.

Nice Mall,mariomva,"This is a nice mall, not too many shops, but it is easy to get around. The sports museum and Harry Caray's pub are fun to visit.",Water Tower Place,June 2018,50
Lots of historical items from old TV and radio shows as well as a nice collection of SNL items,GARuss,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first heard of this museum since I'm not very familiar with Chicago radio/TV history but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the museum housed a rich collection of items from all sorts of local and national TV shows (news shows, children's shows, dramas, documentaries, etc.). I especially enjoyed the recreated set pieces and costumes from Saturday Night Live. If you are a fan of television and/or SNL then this is a must-see. ",Museum of Broadcast Communications,May 2018,50
"Interesting but if there a VISITING EXHIBIT adds to the ""must go""",lovetoexplore123,"I must confess I visited the Museum because Saturday NIGHT LIVE was the Special Exhibit and I really wanted to see it- well worth it. That exhibit was outstanding.  After,  I was done with that tour I did visit the rest of the Museum, I thought it was rather dull. I think they need to make it more interactive - engaging for kids -- The whole setting seemed rather blah. ",Museum of Broadcast Communications,October 2018,30
A great trip down memory lane,wcavalli,We payed $5 for the general admission. It was $20 dollars more if you wanted to see the SNL floor. I grew up in Chicago so I was very excited to see Cuddly Dudley from Ray Raynor and the Bozo collection. They even have son of Svenguli! I could easily spent the day just watching all those old tv shows that don't air anymore. We also enjoyed the small theater that was running Laugh In.,Museum of Broadcast Communications,December 2018,50
The Saturday Night Live Experience was excellent!,Brian P,Never in a million years would I think to visit a broadcast museum... but the Saturday Night Live exhibit brought us to the Museum of Broadcast Communications.  If you are a Saturday Night Live fan or just enjoy radio and tv this place is worth the visit!  The SNL exhibit walks you through a week of creating the show.  It provides great insight into the process and the props/costumes shown were great.  Just fantastic!,Museum of Broadcast Communications,December 2018,50
Albany Park Walking Tour,LC0717,Decided to do the Albany Park Walking Tour and learn more about the neighborhood since it was free. It turned out to be a very informative tour and I even discovered there is a waterfall in the area where people actually went fishing as weird as it sounds. The weather held up and I enjoyed learning about the neighborhood.,The 606,September 2016,50
Lovely way to spend a few hours,MSH444,Look at the map before you go - there's plenty of free side street parking available along the various entrances.,The 606,August 2017,50
Great trail for walking/running/biking,Kevin_and_Emily,"My wife and I visited her sister in Chicago on Labor Day, and she had just moved into a condo that sat right along the 606 trail.  We went for a walk that night and I went for a jog the next morning, and I was impressed!  The paved path is smooth with plenty of room for walkers, bikers and runners.  There is a ""shoulder"" on both sides that has a thin rubber layer on it which is good to help lessen the impact on your joints when running.  There are also many access points along the trail, some leading to parks, and also a neat sculpture made of tires.  There was an Aldi not too far from where we were staying and we were able to use the trail to walk to the Aldi and back to get some groceries.  There were always many people using the path no matter what time of the day it was.  The path was also very well maintained, and I saw several grounds crews working on the landscaping alongside the trail during my morning jog.  I just have to say I really love it when a city provides avenues to improve transportation on foot or bike, and I would enjoy having a similar type of trail close to me in my own town.",The 606,September 2017,50
Favorite Trail in Chicago,averyoffthegrid,"Really cool elevated trail/bridge that connects a bunch of parks across West Town and Logan Square. Plenty of stops to get on and off the trail and it offers some cool views of the city. It’s great for jogging, biking, walking, or just lounging around. ",The 606,November 2017,50
fun trail but watch out for bikes,denisemT3534YA,"This trail is awesome.  As a gardener, I must say, the landscaping is superior. There are a bunch of great attractions just off the trail, too. There's a really nice dog park at Damen Ave., and maybe the best coffee shop ever, Ipsento on Milwaukee Ave. On any temperate day, and there are a few, this is a great place to get exercise and see a couple of great neighborhoods. You can bail and go to Lemmings on Damen, for a nice, cold beer when you've finished your walk.",The 606,October 2017,40
"Boring Air Over Water ""Show""",turbotony,"Yes Boring!  !0 am to 3 pm Sat & Sun, Crowds, Heat, Rain, Parking, Buses/Trains. Dogs, Cigarettes, Babies, & Port-O-Potties...do I need to go on?   If you've done the Taste of Chicago Thing a Few Times, put the Airshow in the same Category.   Too many people, too much traffic, too many kids/babies/dogs, too many smokers, too much heat/rain, and too many talking people.  And, do you really think you can see what's happening miles up in the sky from your crowded position.  No matter where you are, you'll miss at least 50% of the show.   Oh yes, once in a while, some jet will buzz you, reach that sonic boom type level, but really, you can't see jets going 2/3/500 mph.  Just catch that smoke trail.   Better to buy their video on line, with close ups, pilot interviews, even cockpit cameras.   We had a reasonable north Ave Beach position, within an hour, 6 groups surrounded us, & as the day wore on, they kept creepin closer & closer. The 3 pm rush to leave was organized Catastrophe.  Better to make friends with someone who has a boat, go out on the lake, & chill out, but you still can't see most of the action.  They hold the Thunderbirds for last.  They should be 1st, at 10 am, cause many people won't stay all day.  The crowds will be less, transport easier.",Chicago Air and Water Show,August 2016,20

An Orgy for Plane Junkies,Zoxil,"My 14 year old son is obsessed with planes. He has been learning to fly for the last year so my wife and I have been learning about all things airplane.  When we learned that the Chicago Air Show was happening the weekend before work required us to be in Chicago we changed our plans so we could be there.  We stayed at the Residence Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile which was walking distance to the center of the Air Show which happens off North Avenue Beach. It is a long walk but I cant imagine getting any closer with the crowds.  We got there early and rented lounge chairs and an umbrella from the Boucher Brothers stands and that was a Godsend.  The first day was overcast and not as crowded but the second day was packed. The North Avenue Beach location lets you hear the announcers and there are lots of port-o-potties and food stands nearby. I don't disagree with the other reviews here... if you are not obsessed by aviation this could be dull. It takes some time between ""acts"" as planes have to clear out before paratroopers can jump in... and vice versa.  The highlight of the show are the Thunderbirds, the precision jet team from the US Air Force, but for folks interested in flying, there are lots of things to be amazed at!  How do you fly straight up and get your plane to hover pointing straight up without moving? If you have young kids who get bored easily, this could be a real long day.  If you are fascinated by things that fly, this can be awesome! My son took lots of photos (some are shown here). He used a 70-300 mm lens that was sufficient to get some great shots!",Chicago Air and Water Show,August 2016,50
Big mall on the north end of Magnificent Mile,luckyguy130,American Girl & Lego store were out targets in here with young kids. Both stores did not disappoint.

Amazing view of downtown Chicago ,O6378WFannag,It is an amazing place in the middle of the city. From here views f downtown are just spectacular.

Could be very crowded and it is sometimes very hard to find parking here in the middle of the day on weekends. ,Montrose Beach,July 2017,50
Perfect dog beach,natesg,Really impressed with this dog beach.  We typically go on weekdays to avoid the weekend crowds.  Our dog is obsessed with the water.  So nice to have a fresh water beach.  She has been to a few dog beaches on Florida vacations and we were always concerned about how much salt water she might drink.  We typically hang on the left side of the beach because it seems more calm for smaller dogs.,Montrose Beach,July 2017,50
Montrose Dog Beach is top of the line,Emma T,"We went to Montrose Dog Beach on our way out of the city and it was amazing! It is completely fenced, clean, and the dogs had so much fun!

Eat a good breakfast and skip lunch as the food is expensive and few options. ($5 for a 12 ounce bottle of Coke -ouch. It would have been $30 for the kids to have a soda.  I let them dehydrate.

The theater, OTOH is in need of refurbishment.  The alignment of the seats is horrible, (at least in the Dress Circle level) you're looking at the back of the head of the person sitting in front of you.

Great for ancient history geeks,Hisun,"As befits it's location at University of Chicago, this museum is a deep dive into ancient history, requiring a full reading of the detailed signage for full appreciation of the artifacts.

Miss Saigon - row E,Flyer272776,"The theatre itself is stunning. I hadn’t read the theatre reviews before going, but have read them since. We didn’t have the same issues with sound and sight. But this was all from row E. we could see and hear everything. The show itself was fabulous, the actors put everything they had into it. The bathroom lines were the only complaint. ",Cadillac Palace Theatre,December 2018,40
Intimate venue. Great to see “Miss Saigon” again after almost 30 years,ImmerWandern,"We paid for and availed of the “Suite Service” offered by the theater.  This gave us access to a room in the basement where we could hang out 45 minutes prior to showtime and have snacks and drinks. There was an open bar and the bartender had already poured flutes of sparkling wine or champagne for us. Beer, wine, mixed drinks were available too. Platters of small sandwiches and a cut-up vegetables with dip provided the accompaniment to our drinks. We hung our coats there, and we had our own bathrooms. We had similar offerings during the intermission with the addition of sweet pastries. It was not cheap at $40pp. However it would be worth it for a special occasion just not to have to line up for drinks and the bathrooms as well as to have a calm place for quiet conversation.

Miserable Experience,Richard N,"We we're told months ahead of time that our 2 year was welcome and we could keep him on our lap without a ticket. On the night of the show the security staff said he had to have a ticket. No biggie we bought it and continued on. 10 to 20 minutes into the show we we're ejected because he was ""disterbing the back stage staff and other guests"" From my point of view he was clapping when the audience clapped and laughing when the audience laughed. I really saw no reason to curse at me and forcefully remove us without any warning.",Cadillac Palace Theatre,December 2018,10

Very congested ,Lam4184,"Water Tower used to be basically a shopping mall and I think they have evolved into more of specialty/touristy type mall, which is fine. The American Girl store is probably the main attraction and they have a great spot called Food Life for lunch. My biggest complaint during a recent visit was that it must have been over 80 degrees inside the whole place when the weather outside was in the 70s. It was so hot we just wanted to leave; I probably would have stayed much longer and spent more money if it had been cool and comfortable. ",Water Tower Place,September 2019,30
My Favorite,Kymm M,"I love this mall so much. The first two times I came, I only stayed centered in Macy's but this visit I went and got popcorn from Garrett's and we looked around in Sephora and a few other stores.

They play a lot of clips of some of their funniest skits so makes for a really enjoyable tour.  It is very interesting to get a look at the work that goes into the show. If you have been watching this show since it started in the 1970's, it will bring back a lot of memories. It was not crowded at all on a Friday afternoon so it was easy to view all the exhibits.

Recycled Railroad,Bill L,"The 606 is a 2.7 mile skinny park on a former railroad right-of-way running through several northwest neighborhoods.  The park was created as a result of the gentrification of the area and has caused an acceleration of that gentrification in neighborhoods at its western end.  The park consists of a concrete pavement center with cushioned running tracks on either side.  Landscaping consists of a variety of small scale trees, bushes, grasses and flowering plants.  The scale of the plantings allow you to see the neighborhoods and nearby residents to provide eyes on the park as an unintended extra level of security; like all urban places, security has become a way of life.  The path is shared by runners, rollerbladers, scooter riders, walkers, buggy pushers and, unfortunately,  bicyclists.  I say unfortunately because the path is too heavily used for the fast riding bicyclists and major injuries are inevitable. But all in all, The 606 is a welcome addition to its neighborhoods. ",The 606,August 2018,40

Awesome show,Allen21096,"The Chicago Air & Water Show is a regular every August.  This year they had the Navy's Blue Angels and a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, among many others.  This event is probably one of the most well-attended events in Chicago.  Traffic and parking is always an issue, so some homework is necessary to make the day go much better.  The best areas to see the show are from Fullerton Ave. to Oak St. Beach along the lakefront.  Believe me, though, you'll see the planes setting up for their paths from other areas of the city, as well.  One interesting thing to note is that on Thursday and Friday, the air show participants practice and the crowd is nothing like the Saturday and Sunday crowd.",Chicago Air and Water Show,August 2017,50

Always a fun weekend in the city,dvkremk,Once again we enjoyed the Chicago Air and Water Show this past weekend.  It is always held in mid-August.  Best views are by the North Avenue Beach where they have speakers to hear the commentary on the performance.  Anther good viewing spot is Oak Street Beach.  We are lucky to have a condo that we can see the planes going buzzing by.  This year the Thunderbirds performed.  They rotate with the Blue Angels as the finale act each year.,Chicago Air and Water Show,August 2018,50

Beautiful but why sell food in the theater?,mizzelle,"On a recent visit my enjoyment of seeing Hamilton was made more difficult by people all around me unwrapping candy and munching on popcorn throughout the show. This was not a ballpark!! Many theaters ban food and drink, yet at CIBC they were walking the aisles selling items before the show.

Frankenstein was so original ,139nathaliep,We picked this theater in the neighborhood of our hotel in Magnificent Mile and it was awesome. We saw Mary Shelley Frankenstein and it was very original.

Love the Lookingglass!!,Elaine H,"We've been to a number of plays at the Lookingglass, and if you're looking for truly creative, immersive, visually arresting productions, make tracks to the Lookingglass.  First of all, it's SO conveniently located - the historic building itself is fascinating and worth the trip alone! and since the theater is small, seating is very comfortably intimate.  You'll see everything - every nuance on the actor's faces, every detail of the set design.  It's truly theater worth seeing!",Lookingglass Theatre Company,November 2019,50
What a delightful production for the whole family,KismetWoods,We went with another couple couple and just marveled at the costumes and production. We thoroughly enjoyed it.

Great conference center! ,372jl,"I have been here before for meetings and had more meetings recently. The place is huge, with meeting rooms of all sizes.

Wonderful hidden gem!,msnowo,"A friend and I went here to kill some time before other museums opens. It open at 8:30! It was wonderful! You get to take your pic with a million dollars, design your own currency, and learn how to spot a counterfeit bill. There’s a nice section that they added on Alexander Hamilton that explains his connection to the first national bank plus includes quotes from the play. It’s also playing at a theater that’s about four blocks away! It was a lot of fun for two middle-aged women so I will definitely be back with my two children.

Nice to see where B. Obama studied,liloo-19,I found in the Internet the info that one of the American Presidents B. Obama studied in Law School of the University of Chicago. And since I’m from Eastern Europe we don’t have the jury in our court and it was also very interesting to see the court hall representing the american law system. Also it was curious to compare the library - we don’t have personal spaces for students. At us all students are preparing at a random free table so they don’t leave their belongings at the library tables. The college building itself is very beautiful as long as Rockefeller Memorial Chapel that can be seen from the library windows.,University of Chicago,January 2018,50
Stunning,Tom S,"I finally got to see this place after my daughter graduated from there. The grounds were stunning, and put the campus of Harvard in the shade, as far as I'm concerned.

With at least five short, daily masses during the week, it provided a much-needed respite from the grind of work. It’s a welcoming place for Catholics and non-Catholics alike, and simply sitting in the quiet space of the church surrounded by colorful stained glass and soaring arches of carved wood is peaceful and centering. For those with a special interest in art, history, and architecture, detailed information about many of the unique features of the cathedral can be found on the official website, along with a labeled floor plan.

Bad Rap,David D,In our travels through the Midwest we added the White Sox to our list of major league parks visited. All we'd heard about the stadium by supposed baseball pundits was it was a terrible place to attend a ballgame. We easily arrived at the park and found parking easily right across the street from the field and at a very reasonable price. Plenty of ChiSox fans were tailgating and having a good time. The staff was nice and the concessions were good. I enjoyed the Chicago Dog. We sat in very reasonably priced seats in the upper deck with a great view of the field with great views of the downtown skyline from the ramps to the upper deck on the left field side.

My favorite theatre in Chicago!,Cheri N,"I love going to the Oriental for shows. It is hands down, the most beautiful theatre in the city. My husband and I were recently there for The King and I. My only complaint was that there was a huge speaker in the middle of the stage (I don't recall it being there before, but it could have been different seating) but once the play began, the speaker was forgotten. I'm thrilled that the place is still as beautiful as ever and I can't wait to go back for more shows. As for The King and I...the singing was outstanding, especially the actress who portrayed Anna! The acting was a little lackluster. The cast looked like they were weary, and since it was close to the end of their run, they well might have been. Overall, we were very happy to go. It's been years since either of us saw The King and I. We were able to get tickets just an hour before the show at a discounted price, and it was well worth it!",James M.

So much to see and do--even if you don't want to do anything,Taylor B,"My wife and I couldn't ask for more. We live three blocks from North Avenue Beach. Our condominium overlooks the beach and Lincoln Park and the Outer Drive. When one million people fill North Avenue Beach and its surroundings to watch the annual Air & Water Show in August, we observe the planes from our dining room window. On hot summer days, we take walks along the beach, from North Avenue to Oak Street. Or we take a cool dip in Lake Michigan. Or we just watch the bikers and joggers and walkers while soaking up the sun. It all makes for a full weekend...relaxing on North Avenue Beach, strolling through Lincoln Park Zoo, sampling the produce at the Farmers' Market in Lincoln Park, standing on the bridge near the south entrance to the Zoo and enjoying a picture-postcard view of Chicago's skyline, standing on the bridge over the Outer Drive and observing the traffic going in and out of the Loop, watching kids playing volleyball on the beach or soccer on the new artificial surface in the park, eating at the Beach House on North Avenue Beach or at one of many restaurants at the Zoo or on nearby Clark Street and Wells Street. If you arrive early, really really, you might get a parking space only steps from the water. More realistically, you can take a bus or bike or walk. Unless it's the weekend of the Air & Water Show, the beach isn't overly crowded because there is so much space. And, remember, the view of the Chicago Skyline and Navy Pier from the North Avenue Beach, and all the way from North Avenue to Oak Street, is like a Norman Rockwell painting.

"Beautiful theater, great productions",GlenSco19,"Our most recent visit was to see The King And I, but we have been going for the opera series for years, along with these Broadway end-of-season offerings the past couple of years. Everything is always top of the line, from the singers and actors to the orchestra and conductors, as well as the stage sets, costumes, lighting, and more, it really feels like a special occasion every time you are there. And that is on top of what you have with the building itself: a beautiful old theater, well kept and renovated over the years, with great decor and wonderful acoustics. Tickets are not cheap, but with what you are getting, this is well worth going to for a special occasion at the very least. Dressy attire recommended.",Lyric Opera of Chicago,May 2016,50
Not just for Operas!,TracyM188,"My husband and I saw the King and I at the Lyric Opera and it was a great show and venue. Very clean, seats were comfy and staff were very helpful.  As you can imagine  at intermission, the restroom line was enormous but he staff made it go 4-5 times quicker than without their guidance. Definitely take in a show here if you get a chance.

Great Station,Danielle W,I found that Union Station was big enough to serve me yet small enough that I didn’t get lost. I liked the assortment of restaurants for travelers to choose from. I also utilized the shops in Union Station. I liked that it was clean and nicely kept. I liked the Great Hall in Union Station. It was great for people watching. I would like to use Union Station again.,Union Station,August 2018,40

Amazing University,jeffreyhunt,A must see destination.,University of Chicago,June 2017,50
If you have a car and some extra time a stroll through the campus is worth it,bkegel,"While not necessarily a tourist destination the Uof C is a nice way to spend a few hours on a sunny day.  The campus itself is beautiful (this is where President Obama taught law).  There are some nice sculptures at the end of the Midway as well as by the library.  You can see where the first nuclear reaction happened.  The term ""Monsters of the Midway"" comes from the Midway Plaisance and the University of Chicago's football team, not the bears.  The area is steeped in history, so if that's your thing UofC is worth the visit.  While you are there you can check out the quintessential Frank Lloyd Wright house The Robie House, it's on campus.  If you are lucky you might run into a noble laureate, a Supreme Court judge or even and ex-president",University of Chicago,June 2017,40
Beautiful campus,PHehir08,"My son was fortunate enough to be accepted and attend Chicago.

Makes you feel like a child again!,SuzanneManhattan,"My three year old son loved this place so much that two visits occurred in one week.  There are so many activities that welcome kids of all ages and interests.  He spent about an hour playing with other kids in the Chicago Fire Department area that includes boots and coats to put on, a pole to slide down, a fire engine to play on, a room to crawl through with ""smoke,"" and a fire hydrant with hoses.  In another area, kids can dig for dinosaur bones.  Transitioning to another area, it is set up like a camp complete with a stream and birds chirping.  One area with way too many kids is the grocery store/kitchen set up space, but he enjoyed that, too.  The museum also has some fairly physical activities to challenge their skills and agility.  I had so much fun just watching him experience it that I can definitely see us returning on future trips.  Make this is a ""must do"" on your plans for a Chicago visit!  We took a city bus to get there from downtown, and it was easy (no transfers).  Before you go, you might want to check the schedule because one day we visited, the evening was free.",Chicago Children's Museum,March 2017,50
Outstanding,ADolores,While in Chicago we were looking for something a two year would enjoy.  The Children's Museum fit the bill.  Our granddaughter loved all the hands on exhibits.

Beautiful place to see a show,Charlie F,We spent three nights in Chicago and on a whim decided to see Something Rotten at the Oriental Theater mainly because the place was so appealing outside.  We had no idea just how beautiful this place was inside until we arrived Saturday night.  Wow!!  This theater was gorgeous inside.

Beautiful Beach!,AWATERMAN09,"We visited North Ave Beach while on a girls trip this past summer.  The beach itself was beautiful with lush sand and little boardwalks to allow you to walk on the sand without burning up your feet.  The water itself was quite cold, but on a 90 degree day in July you certainly needed it.  We had lunch and drinks on the ship there.  The prices and food were good - only downfall was the lack of shade there.  Had the day not been so hot it wouldn't have mattered, but the day we went was blistering hot.  A huge PRO is the self service water there.  Service was good, but the bathroom situation was less than desirable. We took a quick Uber here from our hotel and think we paid less than $20.

They were imaginatively directed and delivered with a modern audience in mind.  We had a 45 minute lunch break and could order a nice wrap and other food items in advance.  I did this and was not disappointed.  The theater is located on Navy Pier and there are a number of options for meals or snacks before or after a play.  As a visitor, you can check with the box office or HotTix for ticket availability.  There are other interesting plays produced besides those of Shakespeare.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,September 2016,50

The gift shop is stocked with many wonderful items.  There is not a place to grab a snack, but there are restaurants within a short walking distance to continue the Mexican experience.

Parking is a little difficult but not impossible to get. You may have to walk a few blocks.

Lots of interactive things to take part in and it was so nice to have opportunities to be provided with things to take away with you - shredded dollars, photos, etc. It was very modern and informative as well as focusing on the history of currency.

Kiddie Musuem,22sylc,"Yes I understand this is a children museum but it should be called a ""baby museum"". Exhibits are more for toddlers not for 8 year old like my children.

Just don't ,juanchodaccach,So disappointing - really ... spend your money outside at Ferris wheel and that area by the pier. This was really a bad children's museum.

Beautiful Theater despite the show,Nancy M,"This is a beautiful iconic theater that is absolutely stunning inside.  We sat in the upper balcony so it was a long way to the stage and the person in front of me made it a bit hard to see without constantly changing my position.  The sound was good, however.  The ushers just point you to your seating area and then you are on your own.  We saw Escape to Margaritaville which is all Jimmy Buffet songs with the basic philosophy of one of the songs which is to ""get drunk and screw"". The leads had excellent voices and did a good job with their parts but I confess I am neither a fan of this music nor its basic philosophy.  The set was very well done and added to the lackluster story line. Not recommended for children.  enjoy the theater but I would recommend a different show.",James M. Nederlander Theatre,November 2017,40

Beautiful theater and great show,Tina W,My sister and I attended Escape to Margaritaville On 11/19.

Oddly enough we were to see Hamilton - the Play and made the connection between him as the picture on the US $10 bill and the story line of the play.  Give it 40 minutes and you'll walk away glad you did.  Warning - it is a US Government building so you do have to go through a short security scan/bag search. ,Money Museum at the Federal Reserve Bank,March 2018,40

Wonderful Museum,Cheryl H,"Be sure to get directions to this museum because we had a little trouble finding it.  Having done so, we absolutely loved what we saw there.  In addition to exploring Mexicanidad in much of its complexity by way of historical artifacts, the museum focuses specifically on the experiences of Mexican migrants to Chicago.

Feel like you lived in the days of Shakespeare,rosebudoh,"The Navy Pier has developed so much since years ago when I used to walk along it's empty concrete walkways.  This Shakespearean theater is truly a great experience of theater in the round.  The stage juts way out into the audience, actors enter and exit down the aisles, and there is really no obstructed/bad viewpoint.  It's built to look just like the theaters in Shakespeare's time with multiple levels and banisters.  We enjoyed seeing Shakespeare in Love and the play was terrific.  Price is very reasonable considering Chicago prices and like I said, there is not a bad seat in the house.  Check it out if you have the opportunity but don't count on eating/drinking anywhere on the pier after the show cuz most places close down after 10 pm.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,April 2017,50

The Chicago Lyric Opera is a short walk from both Union Station (Amtrak & Metro) and Ogilvie Transportation Center (suburban Metro trains).  Lots of restaurants nearby or at the Opera House (expensive).  First Balcony tickets are a good value.  Less expensive than the main floor, but still not too far up.

The house was a huge distraction,RonBlumenthal,Mozart's Magic Flute has beautiful music expertly played at the Lyric Opera. The 1791 opera was updated to a 1960's Cape Cod house that rotated constantly during the 3 ½ hour production. I'm sorry I never saw the opera in its original setting and costumes. I found the house and Disney like characters an irritating distraction. Except for the Queen I found the voices less than stirring or inspiring. It was disappointing. ,Lyric Opera of Chicago,December 2016,30

It is great for younger children 6 and under, not really meant for bigger kids. I loved the small sized toilets as I always have to lift my little up to use the toilet and wash her hands she was happy to be able to do that on her own. The one thing I would suggest is hand sanitizer dispensers by the areas. Other than that it makes for a great time with the little ones. ",Chicago Children's Museum,July 2017,50

The costumes/puppets are fantastic, the actors are great, the energy level is through the roof, and I cannot imagine anyone who wouldn't enjoy this play completely.  Six of us liked six different characters the best.  Everyone is that good.  But buy your tickets RIGHT NOW as this show closes 8/24.  DON""T MISS IT!",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,August 2017,50
Super family entertainment,arlenet36,"My granddaughter and her 2 girls (12 and 9) and I saw Madagascar at Chicago Shakespeare at Navy Pier last month.

It was a wonderful afternoon at the theater for the whole family.   We loved it!",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,August 2017,50
Best Children's Theater Productions,msp526,"Madagascar was our 4th children's production we have seen at this theater in the last five years. We are always so impressed with the level of quality with the sets, the music, the costuming and the acting. These shows are not just for children to enjoy, but truly made for the entire family. We look forward to this every summer. Highly recommend!!",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,August 2017,50
I LOVE CST!,Minda P,"I have seen two shows at the CST, and both knocked it out of the park. This past weekend I attended opening night of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" and it was fantastic. The acting was excellent and the new framework created for the play was perfect--the addition of the suffragette theme was truly inspired and inspiring. I traveled 3 hours to see this show, and it was well worth it.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,September 2017,50

Beautiful Exterior Filled with Typical Stores,AKAshon,"I came across this building after crossing the Michigan Avenue Bridge. It was near the Trump Tower and stood out due to its white terra cotta, classical architecture. When I went inside the building, I was disappointed with the modern stores that he occupied its main floor, including a Walgreens. It would’ve been better had they retain the integrity of the building and what it stood for, rather than modernize it.",Wrigley Building,February 2018,30

The Wrigley Building,andrewsC7868UF,My favorite building in Chicago. The Wrigley Building is a Chicago landmark with tons of history and wonderful architecture.

Uber lot close to ballpark & easy to find after game. We were supposed to use Gate 5 to enter, but couldn't find it!! We did exit that way & were dumbfounded to find you walk across a skywalk to cross over the street below...lol. Nice to see many Indians fans in the stands that night.",Guaranteed Rate Field,August 2018,50

Nice Venue,06BB,"I hadn't been to Guaranteed Rate since it was US Cellular Field. They have done a lot of renovations and it is a very nice ballpark. My friends and I were in the box seats on the 1st base line and could see everything fine. Looks like all of the seats have great views. Parking is easy and only $20 which is reasonable especially considering how close you are to the park. There are plenty of food option in and around the park too. Once the team gets better the atmosphere will be even better, but if you want to catch a game at a reasonable price head to Guaranteed Rate Field.",Guaranteed Rate Field,August 2018,40
Great Park!,lindseyjagboy1,Attended a game on 8/18 with my 11 year old son.  Rode the Red Line to the game - public transit was very easy to use.  Waited 5 minutes or less coming and going.  Great seats.  Watched batting practice before game.  Best part was the Nun throwing out the first pitch - she nailed it.  Attendant made my son’s day by giving him a ball as he was the first child in our section.  Food was delicious.  Wonderful experience!,Guaranteed Rate Field,August 2018,50

"Chicago's best opera venue, a grand palace.",R Bruce D,The Lyric is a wonderful venue and joy to visit.  However the quality of the productions seem to have been sagging.  It is well known there is some issue with funding and I am sorry to say it shows in the staging and perhaps casting as well.  I hope they will be able to bolster their organization to be able to reverse the trend.  Very strong leadership is necessary as it seems this is where the weakness lies.  The Lyric should be world class.,Lyric Opera of Chicago,February 2017,30
Great Music in a Lovely Space,MaryinChicago,"Lyric Opera has put together another great season with lots of variety.  Especially nice was ""The Magic Flute"" production recently  The opera was imaginatively set in the mid-20th Century but the music was faithful to Mozart's score.  The staff were polite and offered excellent assistance.  Check with the box office if you are just in town for a brief period of time.  The venue also presents some other excellent musical performances..",Lyric Opera of Chicago,January 2017,50

I googled lyric but was routed to a broker who did not disclose that they were a broker and did not disclose they were marking up the tickets.  Be careful before you buy because Lyric has aligned with a very dishonest company called Ticket Fullfillment .  They are in fact a reseller who marks the tickets up.  Do not buy your lyric tickets on line, call and buy them over the phone.  Verify that this is not a resale and the tickets are not being marked up.",Lyric Opera of Chicago,March 2017,10

Mostly Good Station,Sliphorn,"I had been through this station many times and they have updated things well.  I had a sleeper car so it was open to me to hang out in the Metropolitan Club room.  It is very good and a major improvement.  It has two stories so you can hang out more privately on the upper floor.  Things that could be better include not being able to check bags while waiting for one's train.  You just leave it in the storage room and hope no one snags it.  It also is very annoying that you cannot bring food from a restaurant into the lounge and was chased out twice.  If you are paying a lot for the sleepers, you should be welcomed in with your own food.  This is a great improvement however.",Union Station,January 2019,40
A pleasant surprise after visiting Penn Station in NYC,Trekking T,"I spent several hours here waiting for a train back to NYC. The interior is beautiful, spacious, CLEAN and well patrolled. Not a single panhandler or homeless person (that I saw) during my visit. I had access to the Metropolitan Lounge, which was great. Able to charge my electronic gadgets and use WIFI while enjoying a snack. Busy but large enough that I was still able to find a quiet corner away from TV noise. I explored a bit and enjoyed the graphics and displays in the Great Hall. Good signs for trains, excellent staff, clean restrooms. A very pleasant place to wait for a train.",Union Station,December 2018,50
A grand space to wait for a trail and engage in people watching,Taylor B,"My wife and I have had the opportunity to experience the grandeur of Union Station on only a few occasions over the years--like Amtrak trips to Denver and St. Louis. And we've also met friends who were coming and going. The interior is beautiful, spacious, clean and well policed. It is a grand space to wait for a train and engage in the lively art of people watching. Located at 225 South Canal Street, Union Station was built in 1925 as one of the last grand American railway stations. At the time, Chicago was a national railway hub, connecting the east and west coasts of the United States. Railroad moguls wanted to create a new, large railway station befitting Chicago's status as America's railway hub. They wanted the station to make an architectural impact, similar to New York City's Grand Central Station and Washington's Union Station. In the end, they designed a complex incorporating two different buildings on either side of Canal Street, connected to each other by a tunnel. The west side building contains the large waiting room, known as the Great Hall, with a 112-foot-high vaulted skylight, marble floors with long benches and marble walls with large Corinthian columns. On the east side of Canal Street was the concourse building, a glass vaulted walkway modeled on the concourse of the now demolished Pennsylvania Station in New York City. Unfortunately, the Chicago version was demolished in 1969 and replaced by office buildings. Today, Union Station remains the only passenger railway station in downtown Chicago. Dearborn Station was closed in 1971 and Central Station was closed in 1972. Union Station, which handled about 100,000 passengers daily during its heyday in the 1940s, handles as many as 40,000 today. It has two sets of tracks, 10 leading northbound and 10 southbound. It is estimated to be capable of handling more than 700 trails in a single day. That's a lot of people watching.",Union Station,January 2019,50
"Three Union Stations, in three days.",O1994GOjohnk,I was traveling by train from DC to LA.  I had a stop in Chicago.

They had $1,000,000 displayed in 1’s, 20’s and 100’s which was fun to see. We both learned a lot about the history of money. It is a small museum but really is worth the trip.

We thought we would merely check out the lobby of the Federal Reserve Building but when we walked in we were surprised to have an officer approach us for Photo ID and then he ""TSA'd"" us!

Went nicely with the evening performance we attended of Hamilton.",Money Museum at the Federal Reserve Bank,September 2018,50

"Great displays, but definitely geared towards kids.",Louise M,"We love visiting scientific museums and such, and the planetarium was on the must see list.  It was nice, had some great displays but is in need of some repairs.  A lot of the displays had chipped paint and scratches, so it looks like upkeep isn't great.  We enjoyed what we saw but felt a lot of it was really geared to more of a children's audience, and there were a lot of school groups there when we visited.  The movies were especially made for a younger audience.  I'd love to see areas specifically for kids, and others more for adults.",Adler Planetarium,April 2019,40
Very educational with lots of fun,Natasha D,Surprised at the amount of exhibits and the amazing feeling and information of their shows. My 5 year old as well as my 16 year old greatly enjoyed it all.

Amazing Summer Dance Series ,loribob67,"We stayed across the street at the Blackstone with a view of Grant Park. They had their summer  dance series going on. Every afternoon they had a different public dance on a big dance floor in the park. We tried Bollywood dancing, line dancing, salsa and ballroom. The concert with the salsa music was fantastic and ended up dancing with a stranger as everyone is there to mingle and dance together. They had drinks for sale or bring your own picnic and chair. This was a highlight of our trip and only steps away from our hotel. ",Grant Park,August 2018,50

Different than Expected,KMH359,"My husband and I brought our two children (3 & 8 yr old). I think most of the trip was above the 3 year old's head, and the 8 yr old enjoyed a large majority of the exhibits but still couldn't follow many of the experiences. Pro: They have a really great children's area however which I would have hoped we would have found sooner; large variety and times of shows; staff very helpful and pleasant. Cons: Map was extremely difficulty to navigate (lots of people helping each other navigate the planetarium); many elevators or different levels were ""Out of Order"" and stairways were difficult to find. I would recommend this for either older kids (probably 10 and older) or just expect the average younger child to get bored quickly. Otherwise great for adults as I wish I would have had more time to view exhibits on my own. ",Adler Planetarium,March 2019,40

While waiting I got to see the security guards horse playing and almost get themselves hurt thankfully no guess was hurt.  When we entered we then went to another line up at our aisle and a short wait till we entered the theatre itself.  Very nicely decorated and ornate in its plaster work.  Our seats were on the floor just right of center and we had a great view of everything.  The dragon at the top of the stage was awesome.  Show was a great rendition I like this show because there are several things about Dorothy and the Elphaba that when its revealed really surprise the audience.  The look on the some faces when its revealed is precious.  This was a small company on a smaller sized stage but the cast did an awesome job.  Really enjoyed the show and the theatre.

A GOOD advantage was they had police on patrol. It may have seemed like alot of people the day we went but its a Big Beach.   One big disadvantage was some areas had garbage left on the beach.

Great theater experience,GregOakPark,My wife and I saw Red Velvet. Small intimate theater. Great actors. What a story - apparently not just Shakespeare plays but also plays related to Shakespeare. This was about first black actor to play Othello on London's main stage. Very accessible and captivating and enjoyable and thought provoking. Definitely suggest. Well worth the price of admission!,Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,December 2017,50
Intimate theater,debrab6591,We loved our experience at this show. Saw Red Velvet and all of the actors were fabulous. The theater was very cool (in the round) and there’s not a bad seat in the house. ,Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,December 2017,50
Q Brothers’ “Carol” was a Tour de Force,douglasl739,"After the show, walk back to the main doors of Navy Pier to hail a cab or drive your car out from the Navy Pier Parking Lot. A cab stand is advertised in the parking garage, but that has never worked for us: cabs are not sent back. Just walk to the front as you talk about the show and you’ll be on your way.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,December 2017,50
A must for fan of theater,Matt S,"    The whole experience exceeded every expectation we had and we can not wait to go back.

Out of this world,epbookraider,"My cheesy title is the only way to describe this museum. We bought the All-Access pass and it was worth every penny.

"Parker says ""Total class.""",ParkerSturbridge,"This tall, white wedding cake used to dominate the Chicago skyline.  And although it's no longer the tallest, it's by far one of the classiest buildings anywhere.  Situated right on the river by the Michigan Avenue Bridge, she can be viewed up close or from afar.  Spectacular at night too.  It's actually a complex of two buildings so take a walk in between the two and have a coffee at Peet's.  Get an up close look at the carvings and intricate exterior work on the building.  A 'must see' in Chicago.",Wrigley Building,June 2018,50

Very nice stadium.,IrishSurfer,"This was our first visit to see The White Sox.  We were part of a wedding party and we were winning.  Then it rained.   Really rained.  Eventually the game was called on account of rain.  When it starts to spit rain, head for cover.  The food was good except the margarita smoothies; waste of money.  Mine had virtually no alcohol.  Stick to beer.  We all had a great time.",Guaranteed Rate Field,September 2018,40
guaranteed good time,MelissaWP,"As Sox fans, we come here frequently.  It's easily accessible via driving or public transportation.  Parking is plentiful and relatively affordable compared to other ballparks and sports venues.  Food is delicious with a wide variety of options.  If seated in the 100 level you can walk around the entire park.  If seated in the club level, seats are extra comfortable and there is the option to go indoors if too hot or too cold.  Great giveaways such as $1 hotdogs on Wednesdays, bobble heads, Sox attire, etc.  Some Friday nights there is an awesome 10-minute fireworks display set to music.  As a designated driver you can sign up at the Guest Relations desk to get a complimentary soft drink.",Guaranteed Rate Field,September 2018,50
Nice shows,Kaumudi P,"Also, the view of Chicago are amazing from here!",Adler Planetarium,May 2018,40
The first planetarium in the United States,Taylor B,"When planning a trip, I think it's wise to do some research in advance. How many days do you need to stay in a city or area in order to see all of the attractions? For example, I advise that Gettysburg and the Grand Canyon are three-day visits. So are Denver and Colorado Springs and Washington DC. Until now, I never thought about Chicago because I live here. I see it every day. But how many days do you need to see all that Chicago has to offer? At least three, maybe more. So many museums, so many historical sites, so many sporting events, so many restaurants, so many shopping and sight-seeing opportunities. The Museum Campus, which includes the Adler Planetarium, Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum, is a day all by itself. The Adler is a public museum dedicated to the study of astronomy and astrophysics. Founded in 1930 by Chicago business leader Max Adler, it was the first planetarium in the United States. Located at 1300 South Lake Shore Drive, on the northeast tip of Northerly Island, on the shore of Lake Michigan, east of Shedd Aquarium, the Adler's mission is to inspire exploration and understanding of the universe. It was designated a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It is home to three full-size theaters, extensive space science exhibitions and a significant collection of antique scientific instruments and print materials. In addition, the Adler boasts the Doane Observatory, one of the only research-active, public urban observatories. The view of the Chicago skyline from the Adler is considered one of the most photogenic in the city. Architecturally, the Adler is a  masterpiece. For its design, architect Ernest A. Grunsfeld Jr. was awarded the gold medal of the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1931. Another trivia note: the Adler boasts the largest and most significant collection of historic scientific instruments in the Western Hemisphere. Opened in 1977, the Doane Observatory is the largest aperture telescope available to the public in the Chicago area. With its 20-inch diameter mirror, the Doane can gather over 5,000 times more light than an unaided human eye, allowing guests to see celestial objects like the Moon, planets, stars and galaxies that are trillions of kilometers, if not light years, away. Aesthetically, the largest of Adler's domed theaters, the Grainger Sky Theater, offers audiences unique shows using the most immersive, technologically enhances theater experience ever developed for a planetarium. The dome itself measures 21 meters across. A visit to the Adler affords visitors a unique opportunity to learn about the secrets of the universe unlike any other. Yes, for unexplained reasons, perhaps because it covers a subject so foreign to most people, it probably is the least visited of all the major museums in Chicago.",Adler Planetarium,November 2018,50
Lots to see and learn,operalover939,"We went to one film, Planet Nine, and then poked around. There are lots of exhibits on several floors, and when they closed the place at 4 pm there were a number of things I hadn’t seen yet. The other members of our group could also have spent more time. A bonus is that you get a wonderful view of the Chicago skyline. Highly recommended unless you’re allergic to astronomy.",Adler Planetarium,November 2018,50
Neat place to take kids,kfsvc78,Very educational place for kids. Interactive also. General admission is reasonable you need pay extra for the show but I  think the basic tour alone was enough for my family.,Adler Planetarium,November 2018,40
Great place,tony-ElH,It’s a great place to see both the sky and city line of Chicago. Plenty os space to walk around and enjoy the view. Dinning is also a good option for groups,Adler Planetarium,November 2018,40
Awful parking ,LostALot22,Arrived at the park at 230’for a 310 Cubs/Sox game.  Traffic was just jammed.  The lots were inadequate. At 315 my kids got out and walked.

Good and Horrible Experiences on the Same Day,NikaJunie,"Now the negative: without this lounge, my experience on February 28, 2019 would have been intolerable. There was a complete computer failure that day, beginning with the morning rush. Trains were delayed as much as nine hours, if they went out at all. As other reviewers have mentioned, the layout of this vast station is somewhat confusing. By the time my delayed train was called, people were literally standing shoulder-to-shoulder throughout the station, except for in the lounge. I could not make my way through this dense crowd before my train left the station and redcaps could not assist passengers. I never did leave Chicago that day. When things go wrong here they can go very wrong. I hope other travelers do not have an experience like mine.",Union Station,February 2019,30

Beautiful Old Building!,rbwildcat,"We took the METRA commuter train from Aurora, IL into Chicago for the day.  We were a little overwhelmed and felt like fish out of water once we arrived at Union Station.  Lots and lots of people and we felt like we were the only ones not knowing what we were doing!  However, once we navigated our way through the mass of people, we loved the historic architecture of the building -- very, very beautiful!  We found a very friendly Chicago police officer who helped us with directions and we were able to take off on foot to explore the area.  It was equally crazy when we left Chicago later that evening with commuters going home, but we made it on the right train and got to our destination!  If you're traveling into Union Station or just exploring downtown Chicago, it's worth taking some extra time to look around the elegant, grand building!",Union Station,March 2019,40
Who knew the federal reserve could be such fun?!?!,leecypoo,"I am not a fan of museums. I am usually bored quickly. The interactive exhibits and activities are a blast.I learned a few things.

Whoever heard of a museum in a bank?,Taylor B,"Chicago has many world-class museums, dedicated to history, art, science, archaeology, space, mammals, marine life, medicine and architecture. But a museum in a bank? Devoted to making money fun with zany exhibits such as a cube containing a million one-dollar bills? Welcome to the Money Museum at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Located at 230 South La Salle Street, the museum is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Guided tours are offered each day at 1 p.m. Go through the Fed's front doors on La Salle Street and look for the museum on your left. Admission is free. All visitors must show a photo ID, walk through a metal detector and have their bags x-rayed before entering the museum. It includes a free kiosk, which takes a guest's picture in front of a million dollars in $100 bills. A million dollars in one-dollar bills and a million dollars in $20 bills are on display. The museum has been known for giving out bags of shredded money as souvenirs. The exhibits cover a mix of academic, hands-on and outright fun. Watch the movie about the history of the Federal Reserve. Counterfeit money is displayed next to real currency to test your skills of observation. And you can see the million-dollar cube. Opened in 2001, the museum offers visitors an informative and interactive look at the important role of the Federal Reserve in maintaining a healthy, growing economy. The 5,600-square-foot space features a functional interplay of elliptical forms, curves and diagonal walls to create a space that invites visitors to explore. How about the disused elevator shaft that has been filled with over $50,000 in coins, creating a cartoonish well of monies? Did you know that the bank regularly shreds around $10 million a day? More importantly, learn about the Fed's role in helping banks run safely and soundly as you take the perspective of a bank manager in the museum's ""Banker Challenge"" game. Don't miss the Hamilton exhibit. Learn about Alexander Hamilton, the man who was the first Secretary of the U.S. Treasury and understand how his vision led to the eventual creation of the Federal Reserve System. Or the video that shows how money is processed. Or the exhibit that enables a person to e-mail a bill of any denomination with his or her face on it.

Fascinating small museum,operalover939,"Located within the Federal Reserve Bank building, this is a fascinating small museum mostly devoted to the monetary and banking history of the United States.

One of Al Capone's rivals was shot outside this church and you can still faintly see bullets holes - you have to look very close and know where to look.  A lot of people think the visible hole is from a bullet but it is not - it was where the mass bulletins were hung.  The actual bullets hit the area around the date (AD 1874, above the cross).  We went inside the church as there was no mass going on - what a beautiful church!  It was also a nice break from the crazy heat outside.",Holy Name Cathedral,June 2018,50

Good Mostly for Ages 3-6,Ddrw,"We visited this museum recently with our 7 year old granddaughter on a Saturday morning. It was very, very crowded. LOTS of strollers parked everywhere. The quarters are somewhat cramped, particularly with so many strollers all around. Although our granddaughter likes ""childrens"" places (museums, etc), she was not very fond of this one because most of the exhibits and activities are designed for younger kids (3-6 maybe).

Currently there is an absolutely terrific exhibit called ""Design Chicago"" which highlights the contributions of Mexico as well as Mexican immigrants to the art and architecture/design of Chicago.  There are wonderful examples of sculpture and painting/prints by Mexican immigrants and just as importantly there is a wonderful presentation of the interaction between American artists and Mexican artists either through travel to Mexico, or the influence of the Mexican Revolution, or productive artistic relationships between Mexican immigrants and Americans.  This exhibit also explains the role of Hull House and its founder Jane Adams in encouraging artistic expression of Mexican immigrants.  It also shows the influence that the Mexican Revolution had on civil rights movement.  There are terrific pieces here that you would not ordinarily see.  An exhibit from the permanent collection demonstrates the variety of artistic expression in Mexican and Mexican American art and is well worth seeing.  There is street parking.  It is within 2 blocks of Ashland Ave and one block of 18th street so that you can probably get there by public transportation, however a car to taxi are probably the easiest way to get there.  You can find good Mexican restaurants along 18th street, east of Ashland.",National Museum of Mexican Art,May 2018,50
Impressive free enrance museum,Josien_Dennis,This is a museum you should visit while walking around in Pilsen. Such a nice musem with free entrance. There were 3 exhibitions while we were visiting and all had great pieces of art and paintings. Probably 1hour visit is ok.,National Museum of Mexican Art,June 2018,50
"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes...",FloridaTravellingmom,"Macbeth is a great play, but I didn't know anything about The Yard at Navy Pier. After getting feedback from TA, I decided to take the plunge, and then lucked out,, 2nd row back from stage in the middle popped up, and they hadn't been there when I looked previously..so glad we went! Actors were great, occasionally going on the main floor and speaking from there. Even my not enthusiastic husband enjoyed the play! The theatre looked like the Rose Theatre in London. So glad we took the chance and went!",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,May 2018,50
Macbeth,Q6550PJ_,"In order for this production to be truly successful, the director must find a better actress to play Lady Macbeth.  There are plenty of such actresses in Chicago — it is a mystery why he didn’t choose one.  It is also a mystery why he allowed the actors to use a confusing jumble of Scottish and American accents.  As it is, I can only give this production of the Scottish Play three stars out of five.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,May 2018,30

Macbeth: Amazing Production,Leslie W,"It was our first time in the Yard section of the theater.  While my sight line was ok from the first balcony, I had to sit a bit crooked in my chair to see the full stage.  Though it feels less intimate than its companion theaters in the complex, it is certainly classic for the genre.  .",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,May 2018,50
Stunning!,SMallrich,"While a college student, I was fortunate to see many productions at the former location and have fond memories of those shows. Decades later I came across an article about the Teller-Posner MACBETH, my favorite play to teach and direct, so I had to make the trip up to Chicago from Southern Illinois to see it. I was thrilled to step into this marvelous new theater and was left breathless by the production, truly the best I've ever seen (and I've seen the Scottish Play many times!) The staff was delightful, all eager to chat excitedly about the show; the lighting and sound and set designs were gorgeous, and the acting was superb. Bravo!

Nice ballpark in a bad part of town. Easy to get to and very safe!,chadalenduff,"The ballpark is also in a sketchy area on the South Side that isn't really incredibly safe. You feel 100% safe though with lots of CPD Officers in the area handling crowds and all on Gamedays and as a result, I have never feared for my safety. Also, with the high crime areas around the ballpark, I would recommend paying the extra money and parking in the Team Parking Lots that are monitored by surveillance cameras, unless you want a flat tire when going back to your car parked in a neighborhood.",Guaranteed Rate Field,November 2017,40
State-of-the-Art,WorldTravelers1999,"We attended one of the White Sox and Royals games back in the Summer. The ticket prices are very reasonable and facility itself is one of the nicer stadiums that I have seen. You can tell that the organization has put a lot of pride into their field. I was amazed to see that such a nice field was placed in a not-so-nice area, though I didn't feel unsafe at any time.

I sure do hope 2019 will be a better year for them. the park is easy to get and parking is everywhere, it is wheel chair friendly, and price is just right. I try to go at least 3 times a year, so far I have not brought them luck as they lost when I was there. maybe this coming year I will bring them good luck, as they sure can use it. check out the website as it gives you all the prices and deals they have, also who they play at home games. so make a day of it and maybe someone can bring them luck, I hope they have a better year in 2019.

"Excellent, provided you have seats near the stage",operalover939,"The operas we attended were excellent (Die Walkuere) and very good (The Pearl Fishers), and this time we could easily see them. The hall very attractive but also big  and almost barn-like. Three years ago we made the mistake of getting seats in the Mezzanine, which, like much of the house, is too far from the stage. This time we had seats in the front orchestra for both productions, and we felt much happier with our choice. As for the operas: we particularly loved Christine Gierke as Bruenhilde and Eric Owens as Wotan in the Wagner opera, but Matthew Polenzani as Nadir and Mariusz Kwiecien as Zurga in the Bizet work were also very fine.",Lyric Opera of Chicago,November 2017,50

World Class,mariagZ1086JM,The Lyric Opera of Chicago is a world class opera company with a world class building.  I love hanging out in the lobby during intermission and watching all the well-dressed people. We ate at the Pearson room on the first floor. The server Nico was fabulous!  The food selection is limited since it is inspired by the operas. I loved the Wienerschnitzel for the Wagner opera and the barbecue pork for Pearl Fishers. The sippy  cups for liquor you can take into the opera house now are a great idea. ,Lyric Opera of Chicago,November 2017,50

Friendly staff and a lot of amenities inside with lot of security and restaurants and the like. Very clean throughout as well. Right across the river from the Willis Tower,Union Station,April 2019,40
A visit to Chicago,TravelKnitter,This station can be a bit confusing and so you have to ask someone how to get from point A to point B OR if you have time in between trains walk around to get  a feel of where things are located.  I got a chance to go to the Metropolitan Lounge which was a nice area to lounge in between your trains.  Snacks and drinks are available and the ladies at the front desk are very helpful,Union Station,April 2019,40
I was pleasantly surprised,Angelaingermany,I took Amtrak train from Chicago to Champaign and was really happy to see how clean and organized everything was.  No stress for me what so ever.

Good for kids,BFDStein,"I stress: great for kids and interesting for adults. But if you have limited time in Chicago and don’t have kids, I’d probably skip this one. While it’s a terrific planetarium and architecturally interesting, it’s exhibits are not particularly unique to Chicago as a city. You can spend more time in the Field museum or at the art institute and see more things there that you can’t see anywhere else in the world. With that said, if we lived near Chicago, the planetarium is probably one of the places we’d go to often. Definitely one of the biggest and best planetariums we’ve been to with a lot of great artifacts. Spend a little extra for a show. ",Adler Planetarium,June 2019,30
A great place to take your kids,Steve G,We visited the planetarium and had the chance to go through the whole building and attended two shows that were available to see.

"""Chicago's front yard""",Taylor B,"Grant Park, popularly referred to as ""Chicago's front yard,"" is a 319-acre urban park in downtown Chicago that dates to the city's founding and contains some of the city's leading attractions. Named in 1901 to honor President Ulysses S. Grant and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993, Grant Park is bordered on the north by Randolph Street, on the south by Roosevelt Road and McFetridge Drive, on the west by Michigan Avenue and on the east by Lake Michigan. Located within the city's central business district, the park's most notable features are Millennium Park, Buckingham Fountain, Maggie Daley Park, Petrillo Music Shell, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum Campus which includes the Field Museum, Adler Planetarium and Shedd Aquarium. It annually hosts some of Chicago's biggest festivals, including Taste of Chicago, Chicago Jazz Festival, Chicago Blues Festival, Grant Park Music Festival and Lollapalooza, a popular multi-day, multi-stage festival of rock concerts. If that isn't enough, the park also includes a section of the 18-mile Chicago Lakefront Trail, the Grant Park Skate Plaza for skateboarders and BMX bikers, two marinas that provide moorings for 1,000 boats, the 18,000-square-foot Grant Bark Park for dogs to get their exercise, 16 softball/baseball fields and 12 tennis courts.

My boys who are 4 and 6 were bored. We went through everything in about an hour and SO MANY things in the various exhibits were broken or missing and this entire museum was a big disappointment. The workers that we encountered were not very pleasant either. My husband and I are both teachers so our admission was only $5.95 each thank goodness! Our family of 4 paid $42 and it was a big waste of money. Such a bummer- Chicago is full of other fun things to do- take your money elsewhere. ,Chicago Children's Museum,April 2018,20
Pricey but fun,akey1101,"I think this place is a bit overpriced; Navy Pier parking is expensive and, even with the ACM reciprocal discount admission was still a lot. (Definitely check out the Field Museum or the Museum of Science and Industry with your toddlers first.) I would say that a 1:1 adult-to-kid ratio is pretty important here since there are several levels and the different exhibits definitely appeal to different ages. There are some nice gated areas for the younger kids--a ""neighborhood"" area and a ""camping"" area, both of which my kids enjoyed. The water area was lots of fun. There's a climbing area that was a blast for the four-year-old. I also thought the arts-and-crafts area was especially impressive; they had an age-appropriate and flexible project going on, with lots of supplies available but also the opportunity for kids to conduct experiments with pre-made projects, which was nice for the limited attention span age group.

It's a terrific venue even if you don't go swimming,Taylor B,"My wife and I live on Chicago's Gold Coast, three blocks from North Avenue Beach. It's a frequent destination on warm, sunny days for a couple of retirees to stroll into Lincoln Park, cross the pedestrian bridge, then walk along the beach and watch adults and children swim (if the water isn't too cold) or play volleyball or barbecue or play checkers or chess or just sit in the sun. Our favorite pastime is to sit on the rocks overlooking Lake Michigan and gaze at the spectacular Chicago skyline, from Navy Pier to Lake Point Tower to the Hancock Building to the Drake Hotel to Oak Street Beach to Lake Shore Drive and beyond. It's a picture post card unlike any other city. North Avenue Beach is at its best in August for the annual Air & Water Show when thousands of people show up to watch the two-day event. When the water is warm enough, swimmers have a holiday with clear water, sand and concessions at the North Avenue Beach pavilion. Parking is available--if you arrive early. But many sun-bathers prefer to take the convenient North Avenue bus, which exits only a block away from the beach. No matter what the weather, the beautiful view is always there.",North Avenue Beach,July 2017,50

We will do this again! Man, miss it already!",North Avenue Beach,August 2017,50

Quick Side trip,Katie P,We did the Lagaunitas brewery tour and still had some time. The museum is not too far and it's free.

A jewel in the city,4thFrog,"We visited the National Museum of Mexican Art with our teenage children recently. What a gem! First, there is no admission fee, so it's a budget friendly experience. It's located in the Pilsen neighborhood, which sports several beautiful murals and authentic cuisine. The museum itself is fairly small, maybe 3-4 gallery rooms. The pieces on display range from paintings to beadwork to sculpture. They deal with a range of topics and were really thought provoking. The museum has a decently-sized gift shop and when you check out, the cashier tells you where the art pieces originated from. My husband had a casual and enjoyable conversation with the director of the museum as he waited outside one of the galleries. One of the gallery displays was about the gentrification of Pilsen, which really got me thinking about the areas in our city that are experiencing renewal and gentrification. I sure hope the process does not make Pilsen lose its colorful flavor and am thankful to the museum for highlighting the possibility.",National Museum of Mexican Art,August 2018,50

Wonderful Experience at The Yard,Swambo118,"The recent production of “Macbeth” was apparently the first Shakespearean production to be performed in the new facility called The Yard.  It is a beautiful facility and the show was magnificent!  Ushers did seem unsure of how to seat people (especially the predominantly elderly audience present for the matinee I attended) in the middle seats of the long rows.  If you have trouble getting by other folks, you may want to take this into consideration when choosing seats.  Also, I did not mind having a lid on my drink in the theater, but it was not a lid that I could drink from, so I had to remove the lid to drink.  This seems counterproductive to the lid’s purpose.  I would also recommending taking an Uber or Lyft to Navy Pier and then allow yourself to enjoy the lovely walk to the venue.  Parking can be difficult.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,June 2018,50
Loved MacBeth. Did NOT love the seats!,Lindym1234,"DO NOT buy tickets for Upper Gallery Row B, section 7, seats 50 +. The seats are uncomfortable, and obstructed view. They do not tell you that they have an obstructed view anywhere when purchasing tickets. We felt like we were literally sitting on top of the row below us.There was no where to put your feet, except for a railing. There was a huge park-style railing in front of us which obstructed our view, unless you hang over the railing with your upper body.  These seats were a little more than the cheapest, at $62.00 each.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,June 2018,40
Beautiful theater,KatySportsGirl,They do a lot with the stages. We really like the new theater that just opened. Avoid sitting high up in the old theater.  It is reasonably priced.

If you walk around the outside walls, there are stones from all over the world, embedded all around the building.  These range from the Great Wall of China, to St. Paul's Cathedral, to Ankor Wat and every famous place in-between. There must be well over 100 stones with plaques that say where each is from.  If you go inside  the building there is beautiful lettering high on the lobby walls, with famous quotes about democracy and freedom of the press.

A Red Sox fan’s take on Guaranteed Rate Field,John A,"My wife and I have just finished our vacation in Chicago by attending a Red Sox-White Sox game at Guaranteed Rate Field. The fact that Boston won 9-2 might affect my review, but it was an interesting experience. The subway ride on the Red Line is convenient and uneventful.  People say, “ the subway on the south side ?”  The people in Chicago are wonderful.  They are friendly, helpful, and comfortable in their city.  The park is clean, perfectly maintained, and fun.  The food concessions are everywhere and good.  The fans are here to have fun and are not too serious about the baseball. NOTHING LIKE FENWAY.  This is not a religion to these folk. It’s all about the food and drink, like the rest of the city.  We had a great time and had great conversation with the people sitting around us. They should all experience a game in Fenway.  Loved it.",Guaranteed Rate Field,May 2019,50

Nice Ballpark,Bosox61,"While it lacks the old time feel of the former Comiskey Park, the replacement Park is still an upgrade. The biggest drawback is that unlike Wrigley there is literally nothing next to it to eat and drink at. Still the ballpark has all the food amenities and beer selection of its north side rival inside.  Tickets are much easier and cheaper to get and the hassle factor considerably less.  Wide concourses, and plenty of concessions and restrooms keep the lines down too.  Nice Ballpark. ",Guaranteed Rate Field,May 2019,40

We stayed at LaQuinta and could walk.  There were many parking garages close.  Drinks were pricey - as one would expect at the opera.  We purchased the cups to we could take the drink in ... it added to the price but was an inexpensive souvenir.  We sat in the first balcony - row C - we could see very well and the super titles were easy to read. We also had a great view of the orchestra.  The seats were a bit tight for anyone who needs to stretch out their legs - so be prepared ... especially for a 3 1/2 hour opera! People wore everything from gowns to jeans - we were comfortable in dress clothes.  All of the staff was very nice and friendly.  Great place to see a show!,Lyric Opera of Chicago,February 2018,50

The Tribune is gone--but not the historic relics,Taylor B,"As a retired newspaperman who worked for the Chicago Daily News and Chicago Sun-Times when Chicago was a four-newspaper town, I never dreamed that one day the Chicago Tribune would not occupy Tribune Tower. It's like the Cubs not playing in Wrigley Field or the Yankees not playing in Yankee Stadium. But the iconic building still stands, giving locals and tourists an opportunity to admire the magnificent neo-Gothic skyscraper and the  many rocks and bricks from a variety of historically significant sites that have been incorporated into the lowest levels of the building and are labeled with their location of origin. Located at 435 North Michigan Avenue, the original Tribune Tower was built in 1868 but was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The current building, designed to be ""the most beautiful and distinctive office building in the world,"" was constructed between 1923 and 1925. It is 462 feet tall with 36 floors and ornate buttresses surrounding the peak of the tower. They are especially visible when the tower is lit at night. American artist Rene Paul Chambellan carved images of Robin Hood and a howling dog near the main entrance to commemorate architects Raymond Hood and John Mead Howells. He also contributed his sculpture talents to the building's ornamentation, gargoyles and the famous Aesops' Screen over the main entrance doors. But the highlight of the building is the brainstorm of then publisher Colonel McCormick, who requested that Chicago Tribune correspondents bring back rocks and bricks from important sites throughout the world to place in the lower levels of Tribune Tower. Today, walk around the building and note stones from the Alamo, the Great Pyramid, the Taj Mahal, the Parthenon, Notre Dame de Paris, Abraham Lincoln's Tomb, the Great Wall of China, Independence Hall, Corregidor Island and the Hagia Sophia. In all, there are 149 fragments in the building. In recent years, additions included a stone from the Berlin Wall, a rock from the Moon and a piece of steel recovered from the World Trade Center. Tribune Tower was declared a Chicago landmark in 1989.",Tribune Tower,September 2018,50

We saw the exhibits, and while the moon stuff based on Apollo and Gemini missions was interesting, there was not enough to see to fill the time.

If your kids are older (our daughter is 10) or you are expecting serious science exhibits like the ones in Boston or other big cities, you will be disappointed. This museum is very small and definitely geared towards kids 1-6. That said, kids that age seemed to love it and it was nice that the activities were all themed to Chicago and its attractions (e.g. the Lake, the architecture, wind, etc)",Chicago Children's Museum,July 2018,30
Expensive for what it offers,engped,This is a good refuge for a bad weather day but the price asked for tickets does. It measure up to what they have to offer.,Chicago Children's Museum,June 2018,30
a beautiful treasure to see!,sheenazzy,this is a beautiful old theatre. We were there for the Pretty Woman -pre-premiere of the musical. The buildings decor is spectacular! the staircase is breath taking! my friends and I were in awe of the beauty throughout this place. It is well kept and clean. The experience was impressive. We had a great view from our seats. My suggestion is check  your view before you buy your seats because some spots are blocked a bit. it's handy to get to by taxi..There is lots ofshopping and great food nearby too,James M. Nederlander Theatre,March 2018,50
Historic Place,matjaz2002,Just walk by and take it in. It is beautiful building. ake the time to see and explore the architecture nuances of this glorious place. Built in the 1920's. Wish we had time to see a show there. The show was playing was about Cher and we weren't too excited by that so we skip. Maybe next time.,James M. Nederlander Theatre,August 2018,40

Nice beach by Lincoln Park,wilslisa,We went to this beach after walking around Lincoln Park Zoo. It gets pretty busy on a sunny day but we managed to find some open spots to lay out by walking further down the beach. There’s restaurants and bars but no alcohol on the beach. ,North Avenue Beach,May 2018,50

Worth a Visit!,barb777,"This is a great museum! You can find wonderful art here by such talented artists. They usually have a Carmen Lomas Garza on exhibit, which is always a treat. It is especially interesting during the Dias de los Muertas exhibit-gorgeous! They have a nice gift shop, too, with very interesting items for purchase. Chicago is lucky to have this hidden gem of a museum.",National Museum of Mexican Art,May 2018,50
Vibrant!,lobstaluva,"Vibrant is the first word that comes to mind when describing this delightful museum.  The brick facade is interesting with its design.  Inside there are photographs, murals, sculptures, paintings, artifacts, pottery, and anything else connected to the Mexican culture, much in vibrant beautiful colors.  There are signs of explanation that are very helpful.  We especially liked the History of Mexico that was broken into five sections, pre-Cuauhtemoc to the present. There is a neat gift shop and bookstore.  One of the largest collections of Mexican history, this little gem of a museum is free!!",National Museum of Mexican Art,September 2018,50

What a Gem of a Museum in Pilsen,Lisa W,Mexican art and ofrendas are a beautiful part of the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago. A walk through all the galleries requires at least an hour. ,National Museum of Mexican Art,October 2018,50
Brilliant museum embedded in its community,EratosthenesCyrene,"This is such a wonderful museum. We go there every year for the Dia de los Muertos ofrenda exhibit and usually once or twice a year in addition. Admission is free which makes it easily accessible for school and community groups in the area, but we always get a membership which both helps support the museum and gives you a discount in the spectacularly good gift shop. The shop and particularly the Christmas Mercado are probably the best ways in the city to buy high-end craft art from Mexico or made by Mexican American artists. The permanent exhibit is very strong and the two smaller rotating ones are often excellent and politically smart. The larger rotating exhibit is where the ofrendas are in Oct/Nov and hosts eclectic exhibits the rest of the year. Definitely worth a visit for art lovers visiting Chicago (esp. in Oct/Nov) and mandatory for anyone interested in Mexican American art and culture. Fantastic neighborhoods (Pilsen, La Villita) on either side mean you can spend the day checking out murals, eating fabulous food, and supporting local businesses.",National Museum of Mexican Art,October 2018,50

Excellent Theatrical Experience,Rita K,"We are visiting from the east coast where we attend Hudson Valley Shakespeare performance annually.  We also have seen wonderful Shakespearean performances in NYC on Broadway and in Washington,DC. This past month we were treated to a spectacular performance at the Navy Pier and have to say that the cast, costumes, staging, etc were all world class! And the theatre itself is a magnificent venue. This is a great resource for the city of Chicago and one worthy of repeat visits!",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,October 2018,50
"Nice, small venue experience ",trtraveltheplace,"We saw Peter Pan here and it was a very cool show. Make sure you use parking for the theatre, it’s a nightmare around Navy Pier otherwise. Plenty to do around the theatre. Make sure you don’t get seats at the corners of the theatre. You can see the “peninsula” of the stage but not most of the typical stage. A lot of the action is out on the peninsula, but there are still some things you miss. Very nice and helpful staff",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,August 2018,40

A special bridge in a special city,RonWamberal,"Chicago has so many wonderful bridges and this may not be the best or prettiest.

Sox won the opener in the bottom of the 9th and rallied to win the night cap after giving up 3 runs in the first! Nice way to spend the evening, even if it was a bit chilly, 50 degrees at end of game but the rain held off until the drive home! Really nice selection of dining options, had to get my Vienna hot dog fix and of course a churro for dessert! Great last night in town",Guaranteed Rate Field,May 2019,40

"Great Food, great atmosphere, kid friendly ",ChadHT,"I love taking my kids to see the White Sox here. Coming from the NW burbs, it’s an easy drive unless it’s rush hour. The food is fabulous. My personal favorite at the park would be the Elotes(corn off the cob). They have an enormous craft beer selection and so many fun activities for kids. A lot of people say that you should stay away from the upper deck but the upper deck behind home plate is a great view and is usually inexpensive. ",Guaranteed Rate Field,July 2018,50

Beautiful venue and a fantastic experience.,JMO63,"We saw Jesus Christ Superstar at the Lyric Opera and what a wonderful experience. We sat in the dress circle, row C and our seats were perfectly centered with the stage. I wish I had gotten seats a bit closer to really see the actors faces, but their voices truely displayed their emotions. The seats were very comfortable and I am a larger person who didn't feel smashed in. We ordered the cheese plate and drinks to ge ready at intermission and there they were all set up and ready. Very nice touch. The Lyric is a beautiful place and the staff is great and welcoming. Took a while to get a taxi when we left which did surprise me, but that was a minor detail.

AMTRAK Lake Shore Limited Dining Is a Deal Breaker,Lorie D,"It's my understanding that coach had a different menu of items they could buy...like bagel with cream cheese...which we would have preferred. I can't stress how bad and misguided the meal service was. It's really sad that one of the good things about Amtrak has been totally ruined by corporate types who probably don't even take the train. It's not fun to be on a train where you can't get off and there's nothing to eat. Next time, I'm flying.",Union Station,July 2019,20

Sales Prevention,Nicknurse1,"My wife and I live just several blocks from Macys on State Street and are regular customers. Until today (1-9-19) our experience has been excellent. We stopped at Macy's to buy fine jewelry. We saw signs everywhere on the sales counters and in the display cases indicating a sale was coming and customers could select an item ""Today"" to be paid for when the 50% off sale begins in a couple of days. The problem was the Macy's wasn't really offering the ability to do that for two more days despite their signs. When questioned about it the sales associate said she would check with her manager. The manager said they had forgotten to put a date on the more than 20 ""Today"" signs spread throughout the fine jewelry department. When asked if a date was going to be put on them the answer was no! It seems Macys is more interested in sales prevention than anything else!",Macy's on State Street,January 2019,10

The Magic of Marshall Field’s is Gone,GuinnessChicago,Colossal disappointment! We went to Macy’s for lunch and to see Santa as we’ve done for many years and it was nothing compared to years past. Each year they’ve reduced things off the menu and raised prices and service has declined but this year they’ve told us Macy’s has sold the upper floors and there was loud construction noise Coming from the 8th floor above. So much so you couldn’t talk or hear the music AND then Santa Land where there were several decorated rooms with ornaments etc. was one small room. I think there are more ornaments in the Orland Park store. Next year we’ll see Santa and take a peak at the tree and eat someplace else. The beauty of Marshall Field’s is nothing but history now. ,Macy's on State Street,December 2018,10

There are 3 levels of exhibits which give a fine history of the people, places, and things of astronomy.

Fourth largest children's museum in the United States,Taylor B,"The first time one of my two daughters visited Chicago, I took her to the Museum of Science and Industry. She loved it. Recently, when my two daughters and my five grandchildren visited Chicago, they insisted that the first place they wanted to visit was the Chicago Children's Museum. They loved it. Located at Navy Pier, it is one of the anchor tenants of the most popular tourist attraction in Illinois. The museum, which opened in 1995, covers 57,000 square feet of exhibition space and includes three floors of educational exhibits, public programs and special events. It is the fourth largest children's museum in the United States and serves more than 650,000 people each year. While the museum has an admission charge, it currently provides free admission to children 15 and under each Thursday from 5 to 8 and all day on the first Sunday of each month. In 2012, the museum announced it had agreed on a new, 90-year lease with Navy Pier. The agreement calls for an expansion of the museum's presence by nearly 50 percent, from 57,000 square feet to 84,000 square feet). There are so many activities for children to get involved with, including the water park, the arts, the videos, the playground. Remember when you were a kid? In the 1940s, there wasn't a Chicago Children's Museum to play with.",Chicago Children's Museum,November 2018,50
many things for kids to play,ELKW,"we have a 3 and 5 years old boy, the 5 years old boy can spend the whole day in it, playing different kinds of things, while the 3 years old one fall into sleep at the last 1 hour.  The children museum has a wide variety of things (including waters, games, cars, supermarket, building, camping, fishing, rope climbing, etc.), covers the needs for a wide range of kids. i think from 0-10 years old would have enjoyment in it. It also has some special things occasionally, need to see it's daily schedule. Also, there is an art center, you can so some art in the room, but need to get ticket in advance (no extra cost). The museum admission fee may be quite expensive, but you can go there at free time, and you can also get some free tickets (may be from library), but the parking there is also expensive, but the annual pass would include the parking fee.",Chicago Children's Museum,November 2018,40

This is one classy theatre with such detail and beauty that if you live any where near Chicago, you must visit it sometime.  The acoustics were wonderful and since it is much more intimate than some of the other theatres in the city, we felt like we were experiencing something very special.

Small museum with wonderful breadth,gettin_there,"I love small museums, and this one does a terrific job giving you an overview of the art created in Mexico and by Mexican Americans across the U.S. Even with a moderate sized collection, they do a wonderful job of introducing you to all kinds of cultural production, whether it's tejano, chicano, Latinx, etc.  The displays are very professional, beautifully installed and lighted. The shop is famous as a cool place to shop. If you really read every label and spend time with every artwork, you could spend an entire afternoon here. It's also possible to glance at some pieces, look hard at others, and/or visit just the special exhibits, and have an excellent experience of an important Chicago culture. The special exhibitions I saw were very small, because some of the artworks were very large. they were very political and thought-provoking. I was very pleased I had decided to seek out this museum. One tip: I had been walking a lot and my feet were very tired when I got there. You have to ask for a folding chair if you want one, and leave your ID in exchange for it. I didn't think of asking until I had been there a while (and it was actually suggested by someone else in my party, or I might now have thought it was possible.) So, ask, if you need that kind of assistance.",National Museum of Mexican Art,December 2018,50

A Gem on Navy Pier,RJK_Chicago,"Frankly, given the high quality of the performances at this theatre, and they are not all Shakespeare, I am surprised that this theatre isn't even more popular than it is. Over the past few years, I find that the quality has done nothing but improve. When I first moved to Chicago in 1975, theatre was not great, in my estimate. Since then, little by little, it has improved in every locale. Now we have theatre not only in the city, but also in the suburbs. The suburban growth is solely due to the success of the in-city venues. The Shakespeare Theatre on Navy Pier has a decided involvement in this. Just last week, we saw the play, ""An Inspector Calls,"" which is done by a world famous director, Stephen Daldry, and is a traveling theatre group from the UK. It is an amazing play. Take note of this theatre.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,February 2019,50
"Location, location, location...",517allisont,"Once inside the Pier, the theatre was not at all easy to find. The directional signage to it was practically non-existent. I'm good at navigating my whereabouts, but leaving the theatre to go back to find a cab was confusing and just as problematical as locating the theatre. There should at least be a sign at the bottom of the stairs announcing this was the way to access the theatre floors.",Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier,March 2019,20

When I visited there were some beautiful floral displays around the various floors, and a beautiful butterfly display hanging from the ceiling. The shop is immaculate as you walk around and the choice of goods available makes it difficult to resist. The ceiling is spectacular.

Used to be Marshall Fields.  Sad that they did not keep the name let alone the service,DeepDishorThin,"This used to be Marshall Fields' flagship store on State Street.  I miss it.  And I miss the level of service that Fields provided.  I wish the Macy's company kept the name and treated this location as special.  Instead, it is just another ho hum Macy's.

The Friendliest Confines,MacBrasel1970,"South side pride is highly evident at this unsung cathedral of the game. Every staff member of the stadium is nicer and more friendlier than the next. This stadium replaced the oldest professional baseball venue in MLB, but it still has the iron archways and the scoreboard with fireworks and pinwheels from the Bill Veck era. The delicious food choices ranged from traditional hot dogs, beer, and popcorn to tasty Mexican dishes, bratwurst, and pizza and burgers. There is a lot of inviting open spaces into which you take an enjoyable stroll during the game as well, but you’re always in view of the game action on the field. It’s simply a beautiful and relaxing place to watch the Chicago White Sox’s games. Although it may not be the baseball stadium you always hear about in the Windy City, this field has a ton of character and has some of the most friendly and helpful people working there.

A riveting production of Siegfried,operalover939,"The building is by no means our favourite opera house: it is too big, it is not configured like an opera house, and the public areas are cramped.

Burkhard Fritz in the title role, Eric Owens as the Wanderer, and Christine Goerke as Bruenhilde headed an excellent cast, while Sir Andrew Davis conducted an orchestra that was in top form.

It is actually tough to describe, even for me a somewhat seasoned writer like me, smile.  The show captures your heart with its magic.  One of my favorite moments was discovering the blue prince chair and the pink princess chair, complete with tiara; the chairs are for family photo memories, on the first floor.   The kids department on the fifth floor had whimsical characters dressed in kids' clothes.  On the seventh floor, there was a mermaid inside the lagoon garden, adorable.

A great piece of historic architecture.,GenotheViking,It's getting harder to get a great view of this wonderful building with all the newer construction surrounding it but it is magnificent.

It was closed, but walked around the lovely campus, and visited the Museum of Oriental Treasures -- not what's it's called, but close.

I was in awe,davidtova,"I loved the atmosphere, the occasional coffee shops, the book stores, and just walking around. But you need to give yourself a goal or two. For example, visiting the musuem of the Oriental Institute, or the Smart Museum or the Rockefeller Cathedral or countless other nooks and crannies. Take your pick; plan a visit and jump off the tourist itinerary for a day.",University of Chicago,May 2019,50

Impressive building and shows,John S,"My favorite part of the visit was seeing all the antique telescopes, astrolabes and other equipment that were on display.

Cool,hunslet49,"I really didn't know what to expect so I couldn't be disappointed. Yes, there is quite a lot about manned space flights but this is what really fascinates people. It amazes me that you can find so many people that are willing to be blasted into space in such a cramped and uncomfortable looking vehicle.There is a fair bit about the planets but they can't go into too much depth as that would be boring.

"Very welcoming,",John C,The congregation was very welcoming. The church was beautiful. The history and architecture of the cathedral was amazing. It was a  beautiful mass.,Holy Name Cathedral,August 2019,40
"Beautiful building, crowded neighborhood",Mark37Chicago,"The ceiling of the cathedral is beautiful woodwork.  Worth it just to see the ceiling and other decorations.  This is a pretty typical north side of Chicago neighborhood, which means it is perfectly safe if you know cities and keep your eyes open.  Parking can make you cry. Don’t ever just assume you are going to find a spot.  There are some parking garages nearby, but they can be expensive.  I have only ever been here for special occasions (confirmations, etc.) so not sure what it is like for mass.  I am sure there are lots of ways to get here on public transportation.  I was born and raised Roman Catholic.  You shouldn’t worry about being here - we don’t have ID cards.  If you stay for a mass, it might be very different from a Protestant mass.  The only thing the church is picky about is they only want Roman Catholics in good standing to take communion.  But again, there are no IDs and no one will know.  A fair number of people skip communion because they don’t consider themselves in “good standing.”  You won’t stick out if you skip it (happens every mass in RC).",Holy Name Cathedral,April 2019,40
be sure to tour the architecture,FlyerInMinn,Went to Mass there.  Didn't have time to tour the architecture. Note the red cardinal's caps in the ceiling. Unique crucifix.  Currently construction occurring across the street (2019),Holy Name Cathedral,September 2019,40

Such for for kids,maui315,We went with an 8 and 11 year old.  They both loved it but the 8 year old could have spent the entire day here.  We stayed several hours.

Kind of boring for ages 7+,holly9816,This is a nice museum but not at all worth the $100 (admission + parking) we spent for our 7 and 8 year old. They were bored at almost every exhibit. The climbing net thing and water works were about the most fun they had there. Great museum for really little children though! ,Chicago Children's Museum,June 2019,30
Nice Museum,Mulhimaam,"The Children's museum which is a four story building at Navy pier can be a great alternative when the weather is raining outside. it is a nice place where kids can learn and play at the same time.

Absolutely Exquisite,cathcole,"Saw Anastasia here. Exquisite restoration of an old cinema from the 1920s. Staff was very professional and very organized...I noticed and appreciated them. Because the theatre was originally a cinema, there really isn't a bad seat in the house except perhaps for the rear floor seats under the balcony. We sat in the Loge Right (Row D), and the seats offered a perfect view of the entire stage at not too great a distance (and not the most expensive).

Stephanie was able to move us to wide open chairs to watch the 2nd act.  I was able to enjoy the 2nd act with my teen and breathe calmly.  Stephanie didn't have to do this for me.

Once it starts, the energy is high throughout. Great ladies. Now, please note, this is NOT for children. NOT.  And to the lady whose daughter sat on her lap and kicked the back of my seat for 2 hours - next time, put child in her own seat. Really though, not for anyone under about 15.

Taking the red line in and out of the stadium is fantastic and makes going to the game hasslefree. The stadium is nice, but sort of bland.

Do not underestimate the less expensive seats,Mamiya7,"We saw Handel's Ariodante at the Lyric Opera last night. We have attended performances here for many years, but we did not have great depth in opera when we first began. Two of our friends who were devoted fans of opera, had their season tickets in the upper balcony where the ticket prices were very reasonably priced. They could have afforded tickets close to the stage, but they believed the sound is best in the upper balcony. They sometimes have some great packages for the upper balcony. The one down side is that it is harder to see, and taking binoculars or opera glasses  is recommended. ",Lyric Opera of Chicago,March 2019,50

There are some gems hiding in here - a beautiful stained glass ceiling and the wood paneled Oak Room, but you have to look a bit to find them.  Make a reservation for a personal shopper.  It is FREE.  The shopper sets up a private room for you ahead of time with the clothes already waiting to be tried on.  A lot of fun.  The shoppers know the sales.

Free and high quality,AlexB10499,"Not every traveler is going to say that a museum about the U.S. monetary system was the highlight of their trip – I wouldn’t say it myself – but I think we’re well-served when we take the time to visit a specialized museum like this one and become “experts” on a particular topic. Museums like the Money Museum were created by people who really are passionate about specific subjects (in this case, the economic history of the United States), and work hard to share their interest with other people who may never have had an occasion to learn about the Federal Reserve or money in general. Nonetheless, this is a free specialty museum in the heart of Chicago’s Financial District. The entrance is on S LaSalle St, down by its intersection with W Jackson Blvd; you have to pass through security to enter, as it occupies the ground floor of the building which houses the Chicago Fed. Once inside, you’ll have a chance to look at historic American coins and bank notes dating back as far as the Colonial days, get to see interactive explanations of how money circulates through the economy, and even pick up a free bag of shredded money. It’s free! On a rainy day, this is a great way to spend an hour out of the weather and learn something new.",Money Museum at the Federal Reserve Bank,September 2019,50
Informative and Fun,Jodie G,"My husband likes to collect coins so I thought he would enjoy this museum. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

Steeple: 245 feet high.  In October 1871, Holy Name was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire.  In 1874 the cornerstone for the new church was laid.

I didn’t feel like the drinks were outrageously priced. $11 for a cocktail. Candy was expensive, but it’s cheaper than the movies. The staff helped me get a booster seat for my daughter and showed me to my seats. If you’re seeing Cats, my tip is Orchestra level, aisle seats! Also, bathroom before show and at intermission only.

The permanent collection is small but very well curated and really provides great context for Mexican history through masterworks of art.  The contemporary works were equally relevant and impactful even for those of us who sometimes struggle with contemporary works! The Day of the Dead exhibits were heartwarming but also very contemporary and chilling (the mass killings in El Paso).

There's one upscale restaurant on the Pier, ""Riva's,"" but its extremely ""upscale"" prices ($55 per entree, for example) is a challenge.

It opened in 1924, stands 425 feet tall, and is clad in white glazed terra cotta, which causes it to almost gleam in the light. It has incredible decorative elements, meant to reflect Italian and French styles from centuries past. Located right at the entrance of the Magnificent Mile (if you’re approaching from the Loop), the Wrigley Building is an icon of the city and is hard to miss.

Taking in its beauty, I took in the beautiful shades of white of its terra cotta.  It was originally the headquarters for the Wrigley chewing gum company.

The MLB experience for next to nothing,AlexB10499,"The home of the Chicago White Sox! Nowadays this is actually in the older and smaller halves of MLB stadiums when you rank them by opening date and capacity. The White Sox are not as popular as the Cubs, who have a longer history in the Windy City and play in the venerable Wrigley Field ballpark. In my opinion, the best thing about Guaranteed Rate Field is how cheap the bleacher seats are. I paid just $7 for my ticket! (Maybe I shouldn’t be saying this, but given that the White Sox are in the bottom third of MLB teams for attendance and that there were so many empty seats to choose from, I was able to sit in a great spot a couple rows behind home plate without issue). If you’re in the city during baseball season and love the game, but don’t want to pay Cubs prices, you can get better seats here than you’d get in your home ballpark for a fraction of what you’d normally pay.",Guaranteed Rate Field,September 2019,50

Conducted by Sir Andrew Davis, who is superb and the wind players are soloists in a small chamber group, so it is nice to watch and the acoustics were so good we could hear each player, including the bassoons and harpsichord. The chorus was excellent and the performers were all world class. They sang without amplification, which improves the vocal quality. Even were we were sitting, we could hear all parts well, although I had to turn up my hearing aide slightly for the tenor. The acting was fantastic and the set changes inspiring.

Fun Public Sculpture,Neta_Avivi,"Located in Millennium Park, in Chicago's Loop area, Crown Fountain is an interactive work of public art and video sculpture. The fountain consists of two 50-foot glass block towers which constantly project video images.

They have fun facial expressions, smiles, and finally, it looks like they're about to whistle and out comes a stream of water to get everyone wet! It doesn't soak the whole area, just a few feet in front of each tower, so you can get out of the way if you don't want to be drenched.

On the sides facing each other are projected faces pulled from a library of thousands of Chicagoans.  Periodically, water briefly jets from the mouths (as seen in the picture).  Watching the faces is almost as interesting as watching the water",Crown Fountain,June 2019,50

"Lots of Shopping, Food Places, Convenience Stores Very Busy",travelwrld44,"Of course it's always fun to walk around downtown shopping district of Chicago. There are so many restauarnts, department stores, speciality stores that are on the street or right off the street that are fun to wonder around within and see stores that aren't necessarily anywhere but in big cities.  Some discount stores have reasonable prices but there are also several designer outlets with skyhigh prices.  The area is a tourist attraction.  There are police everywhere.  There are also bums, beggars, hustlers etc. too...So enjoy & be safe!",The Magnificent Mile,October 2019,40

More than a dome,mohead,"Went to check out the dome, but found the whole building so interesting. Had a nice chat with the lady at the information desk. She told me how she used to come to the place when it was a library and how the city wanted to tear it down. When you see the level of detail and all the hand-laid mosaics you'll wonder how anyone could consider tearing it down. My favorite place actually was the old front lobby with famous authors' names all in mosaic in the ceiling.....a snapshot of the late 1800's literary scene plus famous Greek authors as well.",Chicago Cultural Center,April 2019,50
Nice but ok if you have to miss it,Lori G,"This is nice to visit, but not a must-see in my opinion.  The Tiffany glass dome is incredible and the interior features impressive, but that's about it.

Hidden gem in downtown,BruinsFanNJ,Stumbled upon this hidden gem in downtown Chicago only minutes from Mag Mile. There is currently an exhibition on the gilded era which is quite interesting. The museum itself is not that big and can be enjoyed in less than two hours. They have a tour for $5 additional fee to the admission.

We passed by the fountain earlier in the morning because it was pouring down rain. I was totally amazed at the amount of people still out there taking pictures. Later the rain stopped but it was still very overcast and I got my Photo Op which Is what I came to do. It would have been so much better on a clear day because it's on the Lake Front. The Ferris Wheel at The Navy Pier you couldn't even see it and The Willis Tower Glass Protector on The Observation Area kept cracking during my visit. But not a total lost being in a city where the food is TREMENDOUS!!!!! ",Buckingham Fountain,June 2019,50

Then for a lousy, limited lunch, another 40 bucks. We took the bus from Union Station, so there were no parking fees ( thank geezus). It was a good museum, but not as good as the Oklahoma State Aquarium, which costs a fraction of the price, and has more interactive, modern, and CLEAN exhibits.

Recalling the way it was in The Gilded Age,Taylor B,"It is a stretch to say that the Richard H. Driehaus Museum is a ""hidden gem"" when the large and fashionable mansion is situated on the corner of Wabash and Erie on Chicago's Near North Side, near the Magnificent Mile, the very epitome of The Gilded Age. But I sense that most people who walk past the building every day are totally aware of what it is. Located at 40 East Erie Street, the museum is housed within the historic Samuel M. Nickerson House, the 1883 residence of a wealthy Chicago banker. Designed by one of Chicago's most prominent architects, Edward J. Burling, the three-story mansion took four years to build and cost $450,000. Upon its completion in 1883, it was reportedly the most expensive and elaborate private residence in Chicago. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and designated a Chicago Landmark in 1977. Although the mansion has been restored, the Driehaus Museum does not re-created the Nickerson period but rather broadly interprets and displays the prevailing design, architecture and decorating tastes of Gilded Age America. The interiors are replete with marble, onyx, carved exotic and domestic woods, glazed tiles and stained glass. On display are original furnishings from the Nickerson era along with American and European decorative arts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including art nouveau furnishings and a number of works by Louis Comfort Tiffany. The museum is named after its founder, Richard H. Driehaus, a Chicago businessman, philanthropist and art collector. Many works from Driehaus' private art collection are on display. The Nickerson family lived in the mansion from 1883 to 1900, then sold the house and property to paper magnate Lucious George Fisher, who lived there until his death in 1916. From 1965 to 2003, it was leased by the College of Surgeons. In 2003, Driehaus acquired the building, restored it, established it as a museum and opened the building to the public in 2008. Since acquiring his first Tiffany work in 1978, Driehaus' collection has grown to include over 1,500 objects, including Favrile glass, vases, furniture, accessories and stained and leaded-glass windows. Among the museum's collection of furniture is a suite of carved neo-Empire maple chairs by George A. Schastey & Co. of New York, one of the original decorators of the Nickerson house, a rare Chickering and Sons grand piano from the Driehaus collection and a Nickerson-era Herter Brothers extension dining table of quarter-sawn white oak. The Main Hall incorporates 17 types of marble as well as onyx and alabaster in its design, which gave rise to its nickname ""The Marble Palace"" in the late 19th century. The museum offers guided tours daily. Theme tours offered on a seasonal basis include a tour of the servants' quarters, a walking tour of the surrounding neighborhood, often referred to as McCormickville, and a discussion of how the Nickersons and other Gilded Age Chicago elite socialized and spent their leisure time. For a hint, see the ballroom on the third floor or tour the second floor, formerly the living quarters of the Nickerson family.",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,November 2018,50
Spectacular!!!,urbanrunner25,"This mansion just blew me away!  The front entry way and hall is filled with 15 kinds of marble that the most spectacular entrance I've ever seen.  The whole ground floor has been restored and is really beautiful, with parquet floors throughout, woodwork, decorative fireplaces and mosaics.  The upper 2 floors display art from changing collections. The tour was worth it as well and explains the house, the previous owners and the era in more detail.",Richard H.

Gilded house,heatheraU4102BA,"My husband and I visited the Driehaus Museum the other day to see the Treasures of the World’s Fair exhibit. We bought the guided tour tickets and were taken on an hour long tour filled with all kinds of history about the house that was built in 1883. We learned a lot about Chicago history and influential individuals  from the Gilded era, as well as facts about the people who built the house. The interior is exquisite, which you would never guess from seeing the outside. The Treasures of the Worlds Fair exhibit is only one room, so it’s not as large as I had hoped, but there were other small exhibits we saw along the way which made up for it. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and helpful, and even tipped us to the fact that the nearby Newberry Library had a World’s Fair of 1893 exhibit, and that it was free, which we promptly went to and checked out.

Beautiful and interesting,r297pl,"There are four floors full of fish, reptiles and other creatures that live in watery environments. Each separate exhibit in the various halls have posted information about what is in that habitat. I loved looking for the different creatures and learning about them from the interactive displays and other informative postings. Everything was bright and easy to read. The underwater experience on the lower second floor is not to be missed!  I swear the beluga whales were playing follow the leader as they brushed against the glass and hit the same item on the water’s surface one after the other. The dolphins looked like they were having a good time racing around and making leaps out of the water. The penguins wattled on land, but swam quickly and sleekly. I had gotten a free wheelchair because of my disability ( they keep your ID until you return the chair) so I didn’t go pet any creatures at the petting stations but had a good time watching the kids. I also learned a great deal about how we effect these critters and their environment. The postings tell how we have hurt them, helped them,  and how we humans can make things better. I even got some respect for the snakes and gators!  Don’t miss the outdoor galleries; the views are spectacular. I didn’t do any 4 D experiences because I forgot about the time difference and was back on the main floor before I realized I had two more hours before closing. I slowed down and enjoyed that floor, especially the Caribbean exhibit in the center. I never saw such huge turtles and fish before. That biggest creature is the human diver, by the way. Wish I could have gotten in, too!  The popcorn smelled good but I didn’t try it because I thought the food was over priced. There are plenty of staff around willing to help and answer questions when you need them. They seemed quite knowledgeable and were all very outgoing. The picture deal seemed great to me and I wish I had more time to browse in the gift shop. I haven’t tried the link to get the male statue in the fountain to speak, so I hope it works when you are out of town. I had a good time for three hours and will remember it for years!

There was an older blonde lady that came running at us shouting ""No, only one at a time"" over and over.  It embarrassed us and made us feel horrible.  We almost turned around and just left.  I wish I had of gotten the woman's name looking back.  There was another girl there that had to look through my purse - I'm guessing she had something to do with security.  She was also VERY rude to deal with.  Other than that we had a fairly good time.  We probably won't go back though - even with free tickets for Illinois residents.

Crown Fountain fun,Tony P,"Each and every time I visit Chicago, I always find the time to go downtown.  One of the reasons is the Crown Fountain.  I love watching people of all ages play and frolic in the water on a hot Summer day.  It is especially fun to see the faces that appear on the monoliths.  One day, I hope my face will make it there.  It was ingenious how they decided to have the people purse their lips and make the water spurt out of their lips.  Such a fun place for us to cool off and for people from all walks of life to spend some time together.  A cultural Mecca for all to embrace.",Crown Fountain,June 2018,50
Interesting?,Rebekah A,This fountain was directly in front of my hotel so I stopped to see it.  I'm not sure how far I'd walk otherwise.  It's interesting?  Different.  It was far too cold to touch the water in May but it would be nice in a hot summer.,Crown Fountain,May 2019,40
Night walk is a must,AllyB46,"If you are in Chicago, make sure you do the River Walk at night. IT becomes a canyon of light and is even more impressive than during the day which is hard to beat. Plenty bars along the route although very pricey by Chicago standards and also very safe feeling with security and numerous points. A must for your visit.",Chicago River,August 2019,50
Architect cruise- Chicago River,Nina044,We did the recommended 90 minute architect cruise along the Chicago river. A must. We learned a lot and got some great pics despite us also seeing it on our Hop on Hop off tour which was fabulous also and would highly recommend.,Chicago River,August 2019,50
Summer in Chicago,Michael R,One of the most amazing things to see in Chicago is the River and the bridges that connect the city. Its the lifeline of the city.,Chicago River,July 2019,50
Sue the T-Rex,Rudy F,This is a great museum. We spent an entire day there and still didn't get to see everything. The highlight was visiting Sue the T-Rex. This exhibit is very well done. It's entertaining and educational.,Field Museum,September 2019,50
Exceptional experience ,gruvgirl,"Where to start...this is one of the finest examples of a natural history museum in the country. From the replica of the pyramid to the largest collection of dinosaur bones in the world, it's incredible. ",Field Museum,September 2019,50
 Go Again!,PeggyN944,"Marvelous entrance, great exhibitions could get lost in here for hours! I’d go again and again. Lots to see and marvel at. Make sure to recite the prayer for the mummys as you go into the crypts! ",Field Museum,September 2019,50
Field Museum - must see,pavelsB3814EB,"I think this is one of the best science museums in US. If you are interested in natural history this is the place to go and don't forget your kids, nobody will be disappointed. Hard to say how much time you need there, it can be just couple hours or whole day, and even whole day won't be enough to see everything. There is always more to see than you have time. Great building, sometimes hard to find parking but that's OK. So far didn't have enough time but during my next visit will definitely watch some of their 3D movies. I think it's a good place where you can go with the family. Probably would be a good idea to come there first thing in the morning so you can skip the lines before the museum gets crowded.",Field Museum,May 2019,50
You’ve got to see the new Sue! You’ve got to see Jurassic Park! Dinosaurs everywhere!,Litedoc,"Dinosaurs everywhere! When you walk into the Field Museum there is the new Sue dino-soaring above you!

Must-See-Must-Do,KimInToronto2019,"A tourist really must do the river walk .. and/or river cruise.

I don’t know what to title this.,T7438FAsarah,"I have never been here, and it does not really seem like the the of place that interests me. If you are interested in these types of places then I am sure you would like it here and should go here.",Chicago Cultural Center,June 2019,50
Great place to visit and it’s actually free!,EzraMildewDesireJr,Great place to visit and it’s actually free!  This is my second time there and they have changing art in the galleries. The two times I’ve been there of the art they’ve had on display has been fabulous. But regardless there are two Tiffany stained-glass dorms that are free and open to the public to view. Absolutely stunning. I love the old architecture. Definitely a place to revisit when I return to Chicago .,Chicago Cultural Center,June 2019,50
Exquisite historic building,Susan P,"We came here as an afterthought after visiting Buckingham Fountain and Cloud Gate and having lunch at the Gage.  Wow!  The vintage details in the former library are exquisite.  Despite preparing for events in both rooms where the domes are located, the staff allowed us to view the domes,  Also, there was a veterans' art exhibit in the rotating exhibit room which contained haunting art.  The Cultural Center should be part of your plan (and of course the price is right).",Chicago Cultural Center,June 2019,50
A great way to see the city and exercise,Z7229JMmartins,One can get lost in the moment so I advise strongly to chose the correct part of the path if you are walking - STAY OUT OF THE BIKE LANES!!,Lakefront Trail,June 2019,50
Beautiful trail to exercise on,Kathy C,"Whether you are by the zoo or uptown, I believe this trail extends over 20 miles. The walk along the beach in Uptown was gorgeous and there was plenty of room to cool off in the water or hang out on the beach or just along the lakeshore. Families and other groups had picnics while the trail was used for walking, biking and skating. Great place to walk the dog, too.",Lakefront Trail,July 2019,40
Sightseeing,BillyS002,"A wonderful facility on the lakefront. There are cycle paths and pedestrian paths, all within view of the skyline of Chicago. The views are fantastic, whether you look inshore or out to the water where there are boats aplenty.",Lakefront Trail,July 2019,50
We make it a point to spend some time walking the trail on every visit,CarpeDiemDFW,"It is such a beautiful place to take a long walk, run, ride, or even swimming laps if you are brave enough to jump in that very cold water ;).  The view of the lake is beautiful as is the view looking back at the city.",Lakefront Trail,June 2019,50
Highlight of Our trip,Julian140,Spent 2 days cycling up and down the 18 mile trail..Fabulous... loved the southern section.. really away from the City. Got Bikes from Biken Roll in Randolph Street.. check out on line bargains.. 4 bikes cost us less than £75 for the day,Lakefront Trail,June 2019,50
A Hidden Gem,Christine O,"This is a remarkable museum--both the house and its contents are a joy to behold. Mr. Dreihaus, quite rightly, was given a lead article in Preservation News a decade or so ago when he opened the museum. He has poured money into preserving and opening to the public an historically and architecturally important Chicago landmark. The exhibitions and the permanent collection, as well as public programs are noteworthy. The location, in the middle of the major shopping/tourism district, is fabulous. A must-see for folks interested in Chicago culture.",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,January 2019,50
Fabulous Restoration,Bonnie B,"Their art shows or exhibits are small scale, but seeing the restored house makes the trip worthwhile.  Just a top notch, no expense spared type of job. ",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,January 2019,50
Wonderful mansion,palisades76,"This is an outstanding mansion/museum. As soon as you enter the door you will be impressed. We spent two hours visiting, which included the hour-long guided tour (worth the additional $5). Before or after the tour you are allowed to wander around at your leisure. ",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,January 2019,50
Incredible Experience,Sydney H,"I have been to Chicago many times, but never had made it to the Driehaus Museum.  After visiting I feel like I didn't really understand the city before, and I wish I had gone here sooner.  Our guide was extremely informative and I felt like I had traveled back in time.  The interiors were just stunning, and each room seemed more fantastic than the last!",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,August 2018,50
Married with Children flashback,Dash7372,"For those of us who remember Married with Children, this gorgeous fountain is must visit.

Iconic Chicago landmark,porterseamus,The Fountain never gets old!  Beautiful part of a magnificent park in the best city in the world.  It's a must-see.,Buckingham Fountain,June 2019,50
Iconic Chicago landmark,PLGSLG,"This fountain is magnificent and reminds me of the fountains found in Versailles, France. Ideally located in the center of Grant Park along the beautiful Lake Michigan. A must see during your summer visit to Chicago.",Buckingham Fountain,July 2019,50
Love and Marriage...,leighzzini,Got to see the fountain that started on Married with Children! Since it’s summer there were many outdoor events around the area but luckily it wasn’t crowded when we went. It was hot and not much shaded sitting area except in nearby cafes that required your patronage to sit and enjoy the view. We just grabbed some ice cream and continued walking about.,Buckingham Fountain,July 2019,50
OK,joewho4,Was able to park just steps away for less than a dollar.  Pretty impressive with a view of the skyline and Lake Michigan.  Most don't know  it is named after the former lead guitarist Lindsay Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac,Buckingham Fountain,July 2019,50
Really fun if you like fish,HDS1,"My wife and I have visited Chicago frequently since our son lives there.  I went to the Shedd alone, because she's not a big aquatic person.  It was great fun.  The main structure consists of a central area with a large tank representing a Caribbean reef with hundreds of fish in it.  I was lucky to get there during feeding time, which was fun to see.  Coming off from that central area like spokes on a wheel are areas showing the Amazon River, the Great Lakes (lampreys are disgusting), and other rivers and lakes.  From there you can take an elevator to the ""Wild Reef"" which is a larger space for more ocean fish.  Once you take the elevator back up, you can go downstairs to the 4-D Theater, which buffets you with wind and spritzes you with water as you watch a movie.  The whales, dolphins, and sea otters are also on this level, and you can watch the dolphin show, which consists of smooth water, then dolphins exploding out to leap 10 feet into the air.",Shedd Aquarium,August 2019,50
Dated,dianne d,"After visiting Atlanta & Monterey Aquarium, the Shedd seemed a little sad by comparison.  Yes, it has a lot of the same stuff, but it feels very confined, dirty and it smelled terrible on the lower levels.  The exhibits are small, some very colorful, but nothing spectacular.  Save your money and visit the other museums instead. ",Shedd Aquarium,September 2019,30
Pricey but high quality ,timmcgeary,The admission fee is a little pricey for for non-residents. But it was a fun time.,Shedd Aquarium,September 2019,40
Under the Sea,Susan P,"Penguins, belugas, dolphins, seals, otters, birds. There is more to see than fish at the aquarium, and there is a lot of those creatures to see as well. Entering the aquarium, you are wowed with an exhibit of the Caribbean reef. From the center of the building you can move out to visit various ecological sites that include rivers and lakes, the polar zone, the Amazon, the Great Lakes, the oceans, and more. With the price of your ticket, you can also enjoy a presentation of leaping dolphins, affectionate beluga, scampy otters, and more. It's a bit on the pricey side, but the animals have gotta eat.",Shedd Aquarium,September 2019,50
VERY Expensive and Disappointing,Me2412,"Did not enjoy our trip to the Shedd Aquarium, it seemed to be a very dated sad aquarium.  Very small displays of most fish/animals, very average and just ""ok"". Our pass included one 4D movie, which we could not hear for all the children screaming and the random special effects i.e. bubbles flying through the seating area and puffs of air seemed forced and did not enhance the experience.  At $40 for admission I would save your money and go buy yourself a good deep dish pizza and skip the Shedd Aquarium.",Shedd Aquarium,September 2019,20

River Architecture Cruise,Baldyangel,"80 minutes and extremely interesting - now an architecture geek. Took loads of photos, but missed the boat load of hotties in bikini's going the other way, had to act reserved in front of the other travellers - did make my wife smirk though watching my frustration!",Chicago River,September 2019,50

Don't miss the Wildlife Photos,dianne d,"We loved the hydroponic gardens hanging in the ceiling, but someone need to post info about it or train the staff to talk to guest about it.  One employee told us they were all air plants.  Most of the exhibits are old and in need of updating, but the the Wildlife Photo exhibit was worth the admission price.",Field Museum,September 2019,30
Natural history at its best,rdsw,"The Field Museum is always a highlight for a trip to Chicago. All ages enjoy displays of nature, including animals according to habitat, and the always impressive “Sue” and other dinosaur skeletons. The fossils, gems, and mummies are favorites of ours. The cafe serves great, pricey, lunches and refreshments.",Field Museum,September 2019,50
A Walk with Sue at the Museum,Susan P,"Sue, the largest and most complete T. rex fossil found, has top billing in the museum, followed by those Lions of Tsavo, immortalized in the movie The Ghost and the Darkness, but there is so much more to see! The Evolving Planet exhibit takes you through the evolution of earth from its beginnings; the Animal Halls depict various species in dioramas of their habitats; Inside Ancient Egypt which goes beyond the regular fascination of mummification and monuments to everyday life in a marketplace, Cultural Halls which describe life in countries of Africa, the Pacific Islands with a Maori Meeting House, China, and more; Tiffany stained glass window exhibit.; and views into Working Laboratories in which conservators, scientists, and paleontologists are at work. Take at least a day to see it all.",Field Museum,September 2019,50
Enormous and impressive ,Bearwife,"We spent a half day at the Field and emerged footsore, but were still only able to catch the tremendous dinosaur/six extinctions, gem, and jade exhibits.  This is a great museum and worth multiple visits.  ",Field Museum,September 2019,50

Mish  mash,H M,"If you start at Oak Street on the north end and head south to the river, you’ve reached the end—but not the end of what’s worth seeing on Michigan Avenue. Keep going, you’ll reach Millennium Park on the east and a glorious array of limestone buildings on the west—best viewed from the bridge on Monroe St., linking the park with the Art Institute.",The Magnificent Mile,November 2019,40

"It's magnificent if you're a retailer, if you're not, you're getting ripped off",Kevin O,"Here's the truth: Having lived in this city for 15 years I can promise that anything you can buy in a store on the Magnificent Mile can be purchased at a local mall or shop not located near there for greatly reduced prices. Case in point: When FAO was open  they had Star Wars figures for $18 each, you could purchase the same thing for $4.99 at the TRU at the Brickyard Mall. Sure the prices are high due to high costs of rent but if you're a smart consumer you'll take your money off the mile and shop elsewhere, try Milwaukee Ave, try Damen, try Devon, etc..The Magnificent Mile is a tourist trap designed to fleece the pockets of the rubes, simple as that",The Magnificent Mile,August 2019,10

GREAT Wednesday Recitals - FREE!,James M,Always on my Chicago visits I attend the Wednesday recitals at 12:15 p.m.  The highest compliment is that I don't even need to know the program - the quality never disappoints.  The recital hall is on the 4th floor underneath a magnificent Tiffany Glass dome.   These recitals are very popular and have a loyal audience of several 100.  I recommend arriving 30-45 minutes early for the best seat choice.  If arriving later you may find seats on the sides or standing room.  These recitals are a delightful Chicago experience.,Chicago Cultural Center,July 2019,50
Beautiful Free Venue,BonnieT159,"I attended the new Chicago Mayor’s Pride Celebration here, and I truly enjoyed the venue. The rooms are beautiful, and the domed ceilings are spectacular. Even though the event was private, the rest of the building was open to the public, as it usually is. There are free concerts here on Wednesday afternoons (I think) and other events to enjoy for free. Definitely worth the visit. ",Chicago Cultural Center,June 2019,50
See the architecture!,kandiss2014,"This is a free activity - except that it's not really an activity. If you have an extra 15 minutes, come inside and see the two beautiful domes and building architecture. This building seems like a ton of wasted space, as there really isn't much here except large open rooms, but I suppose it is great for events. ",Chicago Cultural Center,July 2019,30

Beautiful,L H,"Can't beat this paved trail when not crowded, but it's treacherous otherwise. Despite finally getting separate biking/walking paths, chaos still reigns when cretins abound: wandering into oncoming 30 mph cyclists, standing at merge areas, not supervising children/pets adequately, littering, etc. Cyclists who should know better don't signal/alert others as they pass, stop without warning, cut people off, etc. On busy weekends, it seems every 3rd person is too busy engaging in self-absorption to obey simple traffic laws. The only problem with common sense is it's not common.",Lakefront Trail,June 2019,30

An interesting visit,fran b,We visited and thought the house was a beautifully restored old Chicago mansion. I would  say the prices for going through were a bit pricey. We were interested in the exhibit from the Columbian Exposition. The house was decorated for Christmas which was beautiful as well ,Richard H. Driehaus Museum,November 2018,30

"Beautiful house museum, great view into Chicago in the gilded age. ",615louisel,"We have spent tons of time in the Art Institute over the years and were looking for something new. I found this museum on TripAdvisor and we really enjoyed our visit.  I recommend the tour and you should get tickets in advance. Our tour was full on a Friday afternoon. Our guide was great and had excellent knowledge of the house, the families connected to it and the history of Chicago in the gilded age. The house is amazing and also serves as an art gallery for visiting exhibitions.  The original owners used it as an exhibition hall for their collection which has since been donated to the Art Institute ( they were founding members). The beauty of a house museum, especially on a tour is that you really can see the whole museum in about 90 minutes, the tour is one hour. This is walking distance from the Magnificent Mile, so if you are like us and want to get in a bit of culture in the middle of the great shopping  and dining, come see this gem of a House Museum.

Relaxing place to stop ,149stuartc,The fountain is a great place to stop and there are plenty of benches. There are rest rooms and a small cafe selling drinks and ice cream.

Just across the road is the lake shore which also has great views of the city.,Buckingham Fountain,August 2019,40

Separated by regions such as Carribean, Great Lakes, Amazon, Pacific, etc. with everything from giant octopus and crabs, piranha, sharks, buluga whales and many species of fish from pet store type to giant predators. There is a also a 3d movie included with the admission.  this attraction is Included with the City Pass.",Shedd Aquarium,October 2019,50
Best seen at night,Mike G,"We took a boat trip at dusk and I think the best way to see this very busy river is at night, it seemed to be alive with activity but watching the buildings change as the sun set has to be best way to see the river and cityscape. ",Chicago River,September 2019,50
Beautiful walk,spandanisin,"Chicago River Walk was an amazing experience. Gorgeous views day and night, shops and restaurants aligning the banks, and boats in the river keeping pace.",Chicago River,September 2019,50
One of the best city riverfronts I've ever seen,Halo44,The downtown area of Chicago completely comes alive because of the transformation of its riverfront. Sit on the steps shaded by trees and watch the boats go up and down. At nighttime it comes alive when they project paintings on to the facade of the huge Mall Exchange building. Lots of places to eat and drink and spectacular views. ,Chicago River,September 2019,50
went on the cruise....,L A S,We did the architectural river cruise - and it was a blast.  So much to see - and we had a great tour guide as well.  The view is beautiful and there was a lot of history behind the buildings etc.  Well worth the price..... a must do!!,Chicago River,September 2019,50

Way too big to see in a day,53heatherb,"The Field Museum is awesome, but it's enormous, so decide in advance what you want to see because you'll never cover it all in one visit.

Also on the firat floor is an Ancient Americas exhibit, really fascinating but so extensive that you could spend an entire day just on that--and if this is a.subject that interest you I would highly recommend that you do so. Then of course there are the dinosaurs. If you have kids, you MUST see those! Don't leave Chicago without at least one day at The Field.",Field Museum,September 2019,50
"Big place, really interesting",NicanorRosario,Place is actually big so take your time walking it all,Field Museum,December 2018,50
Too much to see!!!,Susan F,Start at the top and work down. Spend the extra few dollars for the special exhibits. Eat before you go and take a snack or two- you will be there all day and food is expensive. As 2 60+ couples we were entertained and educated. ,Field Museum,September 2019,50
Amazing!,limaalphawhiskey1986,Anyone who is enamored with nature and history should check this place out. There is so much to see. Any subject someone might be interested in can find an exhibit here.

But it wasn’t too bad navigating the crowd.  ,Field Museum,September 2019,50
Shopping in Chicago,jbree17,"Walking along the Magnificent Mile is a fun thing to do, especially if it's your first time in Chicago.

Amazing,MosseTurku,This was my first visit to Chicago and I fell in love with the Riverwalk at first sight. Walking along the river was just amazing watching the skyscrapers on the opposite side with restaurants and docks underneath. There was also a lot of open air restaurants and bars along the Riverwalk and it was nice to sit down with a beer and watch the different looking tour boats running back and forth. Early one morning I went for a run with my son along the Riverwalk and we weren't the only ones in spite of the rainy weather as it seems popular amongst runners. During the day it's a bit difficult to run due to the crowd. It was easy to continue to the lake front all the way to the Shedd Aquay.,Chicago Riverwalk,October 2019,50

The Trail is fun for the entire family with a variety of individuals on the trail. we used the DIVVY bike rentals which were good 3 speed bikes, but there are several bike rental shops in the area, if you prefer that route as we did not have helmets and I am sure you could get helmets where you rent bikes, just not at the DIVVY rental areas.

For the price, this a great little zoo, although some of the exhibits feel a bit dated. There were too many cement-based enclosures and not enough naturalistic habitats for the animals to live in. Animal sightings were a little spotty given the weather, but what we did see was varied and interesting, our favorite being the sloth (because sloths rule!).",Lincoln Park Zoo,April 2019,40

A Gilded Age Gem,metrochica,"Seeing the Richard H. Driehaus Museum was a highlight of our trip to Chicago. It is a visit back to the early 1900s visiting the Nickerson Mansion, which was called the Marble Palace back in its day. Thank goodness this gem was resored because it is absolutely stunning. The marble, the workwork, the tiles, and glass (Tiffany or otherwise) are just amazing. Hard to believe how it was recovered from a mix of water damage and over a century-worth of soot and grime. Kudos to the professionals who brought the mansion back to life. We did a self-guided tour as things were well marked. I bought the book on how it was restored, which has great information and wonderful photos. Also, loved the Yinka Shonibare exhibit which was very interesting. Make sure to watch the short video of him explaining his artistic vision and inspiration on the second floor.",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,May 2019,50
A great Find,Susan K,"We just happened to be walking past this Museum House and are glad we stopped in for a tour.

The museum is always looking for new, interesting, and important exhibits, so it is worth revisiting to review and discover facts about our earth's history. SUE has been moved upstairs where they have created a more dynamic, less static display, SUE's world, which conveys SUE's life in what became South Dakota into a more colorful and moving presentation.  We also saw a wildlife photography display that was quite interesting.  Oh yes, then there are the beautiful plants hanging from the ceiling in the main hall.  Ask about them.",Field Museum,October 2019,50
This is my favorite museum in Chicago!,crunch6,We loved being at the 125th Birthday Gala!,Field Museum,October 2019,50
Fascinating exhibits galore!,John S,In the end the end the Field museum is fantastic with the only drawbacks being that it is too big to see in one day for a tourist as well as the previous comments about it closing too early and the dim lights and hard to read text. I look forward to visiting again someday to see what is new.,Field Museum,October 2019,50
Great Museum,MeTonyBC,"being from St Louis, we have great museums and they are all free.  Therefore, paying to go was a challenge.  However it was well worth.  You will need a full day and most likely two because there is soooo much to see.",Field Museum,February 2019,50
"Really neat, but almost overwhelming",Andrea K,"The displays inside the Field Museum are really neat, educational, and well done.  The displays are not very hands on or interactive, although there were plenty of things to touch.  (I was not necessarily expecting or needing hands on or interactive, but I'm just sharing my observation for others that might have that expectation or need.)  It can be a little overwhelming because there is SO MUCH STUFF!  But, all of the dinosaur and taxidermy displays that I saw were stellar.  We enjoyed sitting in the Audubon's art room, although that area was smaller than I expected.  The gem display was beautiful, and there was a nice, informative staff member in the gem area sharing stories and fun facts about the gems.  We paid for the basic entry which did not include some of the special exhibits or movies, but it still gave us plenty to see in the museum.  The layout of the museum on the map seems simple enough, but we found ourselves getting lost or missing exhibits at every turn.  We somehow even missed ""Sue"" and had to turn ourselves around to find her display.  (Worth it!)  Be prepared to pay to park $20-$25 at Soldier Field or nearby, but the parking was very close to the museum and easy to find.  Exploring this museum was something I've wanted to do for years, and I'm glad we finally made it.  It is fascinating, even if you don't see all of it!",Field Museum,October 2019,40
It’s free!,222MargaretC,"A pleasant surprise while walking the Riverwalk we came to Lincoln Park Zoo. It is free but we did donate $5. We saw zebra, kangaroo, tapir, primates, flamingoes while we walked around . We were heading to a cubs game so we didn’t stay long so I’m sure we missed a lot but hey it was free! There was a nice restaurant there to have lunch and vendors with face painting , ice cream.",Lincoln Park Zoo,August 2019,50

Great city zoo ,bluechippm,"During our world travels we have seldom come across such a lovely attraction that is free. Easy to get to location, well laid out, good environment for the wild life. A real treat for the residents of Chicago and visitors to the city. Certainly worth 2 or 3 hour visit, we loved it ",Lincoln Park Zoo,September 2019,50
What I learned from our monkey cousins that my little girl thinks they a men not gorillas,Laurel S,"I had the most fun at the zoo,  roaming around like a grown up teenager. But I came into the gorilla dens and was amazed by our animal partners.  They were so beautiful and splendid families.  They sat quietly with their babies, or fed them when the awoke.  They played and swung on the ropes.  BUT...what got my total interest was the Father Gorilla in the room.  He was sitting alone against the wall playing with the COMPUTER.  He was playing games and responding to light questions and gladly too credit for his ability.  I sure love out cousins.",Lincoln Park Zoo,September 2019,50
Nice but probably overrated,932mikea,"A walk down the street is pretty much par for this event. Stores to stop in and shop at, and we found a museum along the way that was free but small. We toured this on way to visit the Drake Hotel.",The Magnificent Mile,August 2019,30

Well worth and hours walk but ear elsewhere,Andrew R,"The river is fascinating and it always has been but now you can walk along the water. Being neophytes to the river walk we had difficulty choosing a restaurant since all looked mediocre and our beer company lived down to that status. I am Chicago grown and breed and you can’t find a properly prepared hot dog something is terribly wrong. Thus the comment, eat elsewhere.",Chicago Riverwalk,September 2019,50
Rain or Shine it was worth the stop,yellowbirdVermont,There had been a lot of rain in the preceding day and drizzle in the morning.  The water was high but the spot was definitely worth the experience.,Chicago Riverwalk,October 2019,40

The ones with animals were very nice and the flowers and plants throughout the zoo were very nice. Be sure to go all the way to the back of the zoo so you can see downtown.  It's a beautiful picture opportunity. ,Lincoln Park Zoo,August 2019,40
Free! Where can you visit anyplace this great at no cost.,M4194XSrobertr,"Took the bus, with the grandkids, to visit a very busy Lincoln Park zoo.

Always a great time at this timeless zoo,davidcox101,"I still can't believe this zoo is free to the public, that's a wonderful touch from the city to it's citizens and visitors!

Polar Bear was my highlight ,getreal2me99,"For a free admission zoo, wow, giving this park a five star.  Even though the zoo itself may not have that many animals too see, it was a great experience to explore.  Polar Bear was here, so it was fantastic that I have the chance to see; it was my highlight.  We visited this place during Fall festival and Columbus Day holiday so it was crowded.  Lots of families roaming around which I didn’t care much.  They have added some kids rides and other things.  There is a few restaurant here to eat so it was not a problem.  I would definitely recommend this place and hopefully I will bring my family here to visit.  ",Lincoln Park Zoo,October 2019,50

Visit to Lakefront Trail Chicago,996markz,"We visit Chicago often, always stay in the Loop and typically are close to the Hancock Tower. In all the years i never took the short walk under Lakeshore Drive (close to the Drake) to Lakeshore Trail and the beachfront. It is beautiful. The trail goes along the lakeshore and if renting a bicycle provides a great cycling trail. The beach is perfect for a day outing. There are places to eat and drink along the trail.  I imagine native Chicago people may laugh at me for this, but if you haven't gone to this area you are missing a huge attraction literally across the street from the busy city.",Lakefront Trail,September 2019,50
Great place to run,LuvDaSun222,"This is an excellent trail which runs along the lake front. Hence the name, eh? It's pretty safe during daylight hours but the tunnels in the Gold Coast are kinda gross. ",Lakefront Trail,September 2019,50

I don't visit many zoos but found this to be the cleanest, friendliest one I've been to.  It appears to have been recently renovated.  The layout was easy and not too long to make a warm day miserable.  There were various places for food and adult beverages.  Some of the animals were not very active due to the heat.  All in all, a great way to spend the day.  Way to go Chicago!",Lincoln Park Zoo,August 2019,50

Terrific historic home with exciting comtemporary art program,ChrisHOhio,"We visited for the Yinka Shonibare show which didn't disappoint, but enjoyed this spectacular gilded age home top to bottom.  The staff was very friendly, didactic signs were informative and thorough, and the Shonibare installations (several of which we'd seen in other institutions) were sensational in such an unexpected setting. I hope we'll get a chance to see a future 'art intervention' in this house museum.",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,June 2019,50
Lovely Old Mansion,alicerabbit,"We took an unguided tour and we were just fine.  Info plaques and laminated cards provide enough info.  There is elevator access to the 3 floors, if you ask.  Great Tiffany lamps and glass.  The woodworking is wonderful.  The ladies restroom on the 2nd floor is pretty authentic.  But the ""Clapper"" toilet is a replica!.  Nice gift shop.  Hopefully, you qualify for a discount.  Military=free;; teachers $10;  Seniors $15;  Regular $20. Requires about an hour if you enjoy old houses.  Walking distance from the Embassy Suites hotel (5 min.) .",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,June 2019,50

"A little out of the way, but you need to walk after Deep Dish Pizza",836tomr,"I have seen this fountain in every movie or TV show filmed in Chicago since I was little.

Family,JuliaMarcuson,Fun day exploring the aquarium as a family with a teen and a tween in tow. They are hard to please but were really engaged for the whole visit.

It's also a good bit easier to get to, and right near the lake.  A lovely place to see with a variety of food options, if the little ones get hungry.  Or bring a picnic and enjoy it by the lake.  Also fairly close to Old Town for another food option.",Lincoln Park Zoo,September 2019,50

Worth it if you feel fit,Regina7534,"We wanted to go to the Museum of the Sciences, so we decided to go cycling with the Divvy bikes. If you pay 15 dollars, you can use as many times the bikes during 24 hours, but never longer than 3 hours at a time. The path is pretty flat but at one moment there's a stretch of it very near the freeway, which is never pleasant. It took us 1 hour and a half to get to the Museum. We managed to use the pedestrian path on the way back (no worries, it was mid-september, on a monday, we were the only ones there). Near the Museum, there's the famous Roby house, made by FL Wright. Luckily, the person at the entrance was kind enough as to let us join a group, though we hadn't made any revervation. Considering the fact that we were leaving the day after...

I was pleased that we were able to see a good deal of original furniture. Our guide did a good job of incorporating the modern art exhibit into her talk, tho we were disappointed that because of the exhibit we were not able to view the mansion's original table in the dining room. Workers and volunteers throughout the mansion were kind, courteous, and willing to answer questions we had. A worthwhile visit.",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,June 2019,50

a magical place,Friederike R,"The show with dolphins, sometimes beluga whales, penguin, sea lion is magical. Make sure you get your ticket at the kiosk for a seat in the show you want to attend. It costs about $40 per person. To avoid lanes get the ticket online. Parking at Soldier Field is the closest, $25. Also there are tons of amazing animals to watch, like sea horses. There are at least two places to eat open. On the highest level (the cafe) was a long line, on level 1 was no line. We spent 6 hours and it felt short. This place can hold thousands of people without feeling crowded. But it can be crowded, especially on free days. I have been there a number of times over several years and it does not get old. I am looking forward to the next time I can go.",Shedd Aquarium,October 2019,50
A place to reckon about our seas future,yorellana,"There is always mix of sadness and joy when I visit an aquarium. I hate to see animals in habitats that albeit caring, are not natural and care-free. It is sad because humans have not been able to live in balance with nature, and we are responsible for the extinction of these habits. The joy comes from seeing animals being so amazingly adaptable, and intelligently living and teaching us about their environment. The Shedd Aquarium is a great institution housed in a Beaux Arts building with loving touches of sea fauna throughout. But you came here to see the animals, not the décor. The layout is easy to navigate with the main floor occupied by the environment exhibits (rivers, lakes, tropical seas, deep seas, etc.) It is with awe that you slightly see a huge anaconda’s head submerged in water, just to discover around the corner it impressive, massive body. Or you find the tiniest multi-colored deadly frogs resting on leaves. Both adults and children are amused by the variety of the sea life, and the aquarium carefully explains why that little creature, be it a sea horse, a shrimp, or a hermit crab, is important to their shirking habitats. When you get to the lower floors, however, you discover the playfulness of cuddly otters, gigantic beluga whales, or the ever-ebullient dolphins. I was thankful for the care of the staff, and hopeful to think that some of us rethink our lives in order to affect them less. If we claim to love them when we visit them in captivity, imagine how it would be if we restore their free nature in the wild.",Shedd Aquarium,October 2019,40

The food, the fans, the atmosphere...everything was awesome! This is truly one of the most magical and memorable moments we’ve ever had at a baseball park! Getting around the stadium was a bit confusing but we finally figured it out! Be sure to get a Chicago style hotdog and Garret’s mix popcorn! Both were amazing! And do the Ivy Tour!! Even if you aren’t a Cubs’ fan, you will love the tour! Truly a special place!!! I hope they never tear it down so that generations to come can enjoy this amazing stadium!

Need more ramps/elevators and hand rails for older guests trying to walk up to their seats. Not very handicap accessible. Long lines for food. Food choices are not very diverse. Much more expensive than the White Sox park. Make sure you stand in the correct food lines as some only take cash, no credit.",Wrigley Field,September 2019,30

Best ballpark in the country!,ua1flyer,"As an avid baseball fan who has been to over 20 cities to watch Major League Baseball, There is no better place to watch a baseball game than Wrigley Field and that includes Fenway! Wrigley like Fenway are the only 2 “ballparks” left,everything else are stadiums. Wrigleyville ,the area surrounding the park are loaded with fun bars and restaurants. It’s a Must to go early before the game and maybe afterwards to experience the area. Inside it’s a great intimate ballpark. Box seats are my preference and on most days, you can get tickets at a reduced price on StubHub hours before the game starts. Plenty of tasty food options, The bleachers especially on a hot day is a less expensive but most times a more fun experience. If you are driving ,parking is not only expensive, but sometimes hard to find, so go online and buy a guaranteed parking spot in advance. I recommend the Toyota lot. Many people staying downtown take the train, easy to get there ,cheap and drops you off 1 block from the park! Safe neighborhood and family friendly. ",Wrigley Field,August 2019,50
Quick stop,NatSteveC,"We would have loved to have seen a game here but only had time for a quick stop for some pictures of the famous sign outside.

Our highlight were gorillas which were incredible, it was great to see them so close up, you could touch them if the glass wasn’t there!  There is a lovely gift shop too.

Actually relax with kids,Aldad447,"6 girls in knee but Lincoln Park makes it a very easy and relaxed experienced.

Staffed with many helpful docents and zookeepers, they are readily available to answer your questions, or tell you about the animals.

Fan Friendly and close to the action..........,Charles S,"I recently spent a fabulous weekend in Chicago and stayed at the Loews Hotel.  Upon our arrival, we decided at the last minute to go to Wrigley Field to see the Cubs vs. Pirates.  We asked the Hotel Concierge to see if she could find 4 excellent seats for the game on such late notice. Within minutes, she went on the Cubs website and secured 4 tickets to the game.  We took an Uber to Wrigley Field and arrived in time for the 1st inning.  So cool to say the least.  The fans were friendly and the Cubs announcer was extremely engaged with the fans.  Fun times for all.  My only complaint is that there are wide columns in Wrigley that hinder your views of the game if you are sitting near any of them.  Our tickets were behind home plate one section up and some 4-5 rows behind one of the columns and several of us kept moving our heads to the left and right just to see the field. No where on the tickets did it say ""partially obstructed view"".  I was extremely upset that the obstructed view was NOT on their website.  So, if you plan on attending a Cubs game at Wrigley Field, make sure you don't have an obstructed view of the playing field.  Enjoy!!!  Great time was had by all. ",Wrigley Field,September 2019,50

Game day ,BostonGary12,Recently attended a Cubs Pirates game and had a great time. First time at this ballpark and was very impressed with the park and surrounding area. Love the outside statues and the surrounding bars. Inside had great seats and after being verbally attacked by an usher for taking a picture of my brother in an open area in the park first base side which we shocked and disappointed. We found our seats and our usher Ray was phenomenal friendly and let us try on his Cubs Championship ring and take pictures with it Ray was the best. The game and the park was amazing we enjoyed the upgrades and cleanliness of Wrigley Field. Was a great way to end our vacation.,Wrigley Field,September 2019,40

( Yes the Reds loss )  Thanks Wrigley field. One of my bucket list is complete watching my Reds play in Wrigley..,Wrigley Field,September 2019,50
Great experience ,RandynKimmy,"Let me say I’m not a big baseball fan. If you are in Chicago... you have to go to a game. It’s just the experience of being at Wrigley Field. So much different than a game on tv. It’s the things that you don’t see on a televised game that make it an experience. The players tossing balls into the stands between innings,the crowd. You have to go at least once in your life.",Wrigley Field,September 2019,50

Fantastic Place For A Walk,Adrian D,The Lakefront Trail is excellent if you enjoy walking.

Full of History,jbree17,"My boyfriend and I checked out the Richard H. Driehaus museum on the last day of our vacation in Chicago. At this point we were pretty broke, so we decided to explore the museum without paying extra for a guided tour. Even without the tour it is still very easy to navigate the museum on your own and read the plaques provided in each room. The details in this place are incredible, and you can imagine yourself taken back in time while you're inside. Highly recommend!",Richard H. Driehaus Museum,August 2019,50

Gigantic,AlexB10499,"Everything about this historic 1927 fountain is gigantic. It was built for a huge sum of money in its time, the equivalent of about $11 million, by a private citizen as a memorial to her brother. It shoots a huge 150-foot-tall jet of water into the air during its water shows, which happen from April to October. Even its symbolic meaning is “huge” in the sense that ‪the fountain‬ is meant to represent nearby Lake Michigan itself. If you’re in Grant Park, especially during the warmer months, make it a point to see ‪the fountain‬ in action.",Buckingham Fountain,October 2019,50

November not the best time to view,Philippa P,We wandered down to have a look at the fountain without realising that the pipes that feed the fountain are drained in the winter months to prevent them freezing.

Disappointed after all these years!,2906charlie,This year the Shed was a disappointment. So much has changed and not for the better. The overall appearance seems run down and tired. Exhibits are average. The show now requires a special separate admission ticket that they do not clearly tell you is needed and do not clearly explain how to get it.  This caused a lot of unhappy families who didnt know to not get in to the show...including us. No one on staff cared.  Just an overall lack of excitement...cleanliness and management. Not sure what has happened...sad. We wont be back.,Shedd Aquarium,November 2019,20
Neat aquarium,awanderfulplan,"As part of the CitiPASS, I visited the aquarium. I only had a couple of hours but was able to see a lot of it! They have some neat 4D movies. My favorite was the Aquatic Presentation!!! You can see beluga whales, dolphins and sea lions performing right in front of you. Definitely a must see when you visit!!! Afterwards go to the level under and see them all swimming around, they're pretty active after the show! I really liked the central Caribbean Reef display of all the fish. They have some other interesting exhibits too. I was pretty bummed with the jellyfish and seahorse exhibits, they're my favorite but it was o.k. here. If you're visiting solo you should be able to fit it in within a couple of hours easily, if you have kids with you, probably 3-4 hours. They have some fun petting areas for the kiddos.",Shedd Aquarium,October 2019,30

"Just as I imagined, The Bean delivered",JeanTaveras,It was a great time being able to see this piece in the middle of Millennium Park! There is always a lot of people around it even in the winter so it is kind of tough getting a clear picture.,Cloud Gate,November 2019,50

Must do in Chicago,ChrisGriff2014,The bean has turned into a must do when visiting Chicago.  In the winter there is ice skating very close.  We also recommend heading over to Maggie Daley park if you have children it is wonderful.,Millennium Park,November 2019,50
Obviously a much admired attraction,Philippa P,Couldn't believe how many people were there even on a really cold day.  Not sure what time the tourist shots are taken with no people.  Was fun to take pictures showing us and others in the reflection.  Very central so easy to fit in other things around a visit there.,Millennium Park,November 2019,40
Amazing views,BagmanNZ,We came here as opposed to Willis Tower as it was a lot closer to our hotel. The advantage we got is that Willis Tower was in out view. Chicago is a pretty stunning city from this high up and is well worth the effort to get here. Loved it.,360 Chicago Observation Deck,May 2019,50
Unfriendliest staff ever ,sophiaxf,"but the staff is so so unfriendly (eating while talking to you, watching private videos on their phones,...) and the Tilt is so not worth it - you can’t take pictures and they charge u 25$ for one pic !?!?",360 Chicago Observation Deck,November 2019,10

Inspirational and experiential learning environment,T4466OUdanield,"I highly recommend taking the time to experience MSI. The U505 German U-Boat exhibit and tour are well worth the added cost. Our tour guide Leslie was friendly, welcoming, knowledgeable, and engaging. I want to thank her for sharing the story with such passion. I have been on this tour several times, and Leslie one of the best guides hands down. MSI has something for everyone.

Second different season going to the bean,518lauriek,"This is the second time we have visited the bean while visiting Chicago ....once in the summer when they had the water walls where kids play in the water around these huge facades then there was a rubber exhibit around the bean old tires made into picture frames and cool sculptures, we took pictures around the bean with the sunlight hitting different angles which was cool. This time it was November chilly and rainy plus the bean now had clouds above it giving it a different look in pictures, there is now an ice rink where the water wall was and there are mirrors replacing the tire exhibit. Plus the park had a huge Christmas tree lit up and other holiday decorations around the park, plus we noticed they were doing horse and buggy rides sort of mimicking Central Park in New York City. Was a whole different experience. Was a lot of fun both times we visited.",Millennium Park,November 2019,50

Millennium Park,kskkd,Very nice park in the middle of Chicago.  Ice skating in the winter.  Try the one on the ribbon around the rock climbing wall rather than the rink on Michigan.  It just seems less crowded.  Catch free concerts.  Fun playground for kids.,Millennium Park,November 2019,50

What a view,randymSF,"Worth the wait!  This venue provides amazing views of the Chicago area from Birdseye perspective.  Once up there, you can’t possibly believe just how vast the lake is and just how flat the surrounding landscape is.  People certainly found the attraction Tilt amusing.

"The new, indoor U505",Nathaniel B,"Lt. Albert David ordered all the men of the boarding party off the boat, and opened the door himself — and act of extraordinary leadership and devotion to duty. The German crew had been in such haste to abandon ship that they had not armed the charges in the compartment, and the American sailors were able to access the manual rudder controls (jammed by the bombardment from the destroyer) and free the rudder. U505 was taken in tow to Bermuda for examination, and in due course was brought to Chicago — and here she is today, an exhibit beyond value, and a monument to the bravery and leadership of American sailors.

Really Cool in Person!,stalsma66,"I'd seen plenty of pictures of the Bean and thought it was neat, but seeing it in person was awesome! It was much bigger than I was anticipating and is really interesting to look at. I went around 7 in the morning and it wasn't busy yet which was a bonus.

Lovely place to wander,lats12345,"This is a lovely and free place to wander. From the excitement of admiring and taking pictures of your family/friends in different perspectives off the mirrored BEAN (cloud gate), to wandering the rubber statues of art, to the meandering gardens, to popping in on free concerts in the Pritzker Pavillion, a jaunt to the Maggie Daley park complete with more meandering walks, water sprayers, trails, in the winter, the ribbon for ice skating, or in summer for rollerblading (all free if you bring your own), rock climbing (for a fee, I believe),  you can enjoy so much at minimal/ no cost.

Finally,mariana954,"I am from downstate Illinois originally, and moved in my young adulthood to California, so ""The Bean"" was way after my time.

Loved it,sarahmX8293SN,"Just go. Chill place to hang out and people watch,  ice skate, do the Bean. The founders of the park pillars are cool too",Millennium Park,November 2019,50
Beautiful!!!!,staajabuatravel,We visited during Christmas and the place was Awesome!!!! The ice rink was a highlight. If you don't have skating shoes you can simply just get them there for a very low price. Access to the rink was free. Be careful with the ice if its your first time because you can easily get injured at your own risk. The rink wasn't too crowed but children have to seriously be accompanied by an adult. I think there are no trainers on site just supervisors. Very good Christmas songs were playing loud speakers. The Bean is truly a landmark. Didn't see anything so special with the glass structure but its a good famous design. The park is so easy to access from downtown Chicago.,Millennium Park,December 2018,40

Amazing sights ,Neish111,"I was visiting my cousin in Chicago for a couple of days and since I had never been, one of the things on the itinerary was to walk around Millennium Park.  I visited in August and was fine with jeans and a t-shirt.  The weather was quite nice.  If you are ok with walking, there is a lot to see and experience on foot.  You have a view of the city, there are food stands; however, there are beautiful grassy/shaded areas to bring your own picnic lunch/snacks. There are different structures to see, one popular one is the “Bean”.  I will include a photo.  You will see most tourists like to take pictures of.  Really nice atmosphere for adults and kids to sight see, play, relax, and have fun. ",Millennium Park,August 2019,40

Just not good.,natalierP5834KB,"Exhibits were broken down and dirty. Cost to get in was outrageous, especially when you have to pay more money for additional exhibits. Overrun with kids.

It was really THAT BAD.",Museum of Science and Industry,October 2019,10
Great starting point,robertwfromthecoast,"We knew about this landmark and put in on our list of sites to see.

Plan ahead and visit when it’s less busy,AlexB10499,"Taking a photo in front of “The Bean” is an almost-obligatory part of a Chicago trip, now that Anish Kapoor’s stainless steel sculpture has become a city icon. Even if you don’t like being in photos, you owe it to yourself to check it out – the way it reflects and distorts the city skyline is very cool, and it creates a kaleidoscope-like effect when viewed from underneath. I will say this: timing is key if you want to view/photograph/enjoy Cloud Gate without big crowds getting in your way. I visited on a Friday morning and there were maybe thirty people in the plaza around it. I returned the same time the next day and there were hundreds of selfie-stick wielding tourists crowding around it.",Cloud Gate,October 2019,50

A MUST SEE,781willams,"This should be at the top of everyone's list when in Chicago.  Built over railroad tracks, it is right downtown Chicago and a place to spend an afternoon.  Nice quiet gardens to walk in and the view is absolutely fantastic--Lake Michigan on one side and Michigan Avenue ( the Magnificent Mile) on the other.  Nice concert area also and an extra bonus if you can catch one of the many free performances in the summer",Millennium Park,October 2019,50
Great Casual Date,Mary B,Great time with lots to do at various prices!! Amazing photo opportunities! We had an awesome lunch and stayed for dinner,Millennium Park,November 2019,50
A must go when visiting Chicago,JMac312,"I lived in the Chicago area most of my life. When ever friends or family come to Chicago, I have a list of places we must visit and Millennium Park is one of them. In the summer you can take cool pictures at the Bean and watch free concerts when eating lunch on the lawn. In the winter there is ice skating. Millennium Park is a great place year round.",Millennium Park,November 2019,50

it's something to see i guess not my cup of tea however,Cheryl C,"This sculpture is actually an engineering masterpiece in the grand scheme of things but its not for me.  It's always crowded... Take a few minutes to ponder and gaze, but leave plenty of time to walk through the beautiful garderns that surround the park an don't miss the Buckingham Fountain while you are there!",Cloud Gate,October 2019,30
A whole day experience ,mojoman79,"From a family who loves science, this was an amazing day spent. When we bring the kids to Chicago next time, this will be on top of the list to hit up. The U505 exhibit is very informative. ",Museum of Science and Industry,October 2019,50
Pay the Extra to Tour the Sub. It’s Worth It,Brooksje,Had a few hours to spend here and could have spent the day and then some. The highlight was the German Submarine and the on-board tour. Very informative. There is something here for everyone ,Museum of Science and Industry,September 2019,50

Magical emotions,brindlebites," This is a very magical place to be. Magical because it draws strangers together as a family  with similar emotions. Everyone is laughing, squealing with delight, running around for a different view of the Bean, or jumping in the air to get an action photo. People opening their hearts to others  and offering to take group pictures for each other even if they don't know that person! Everyone smiles!",Millennium Park,October 2019,50
Not a hidden gem,ElaineS184,"Plenty of people go to Millennium Park but it didn’t feel crowded. I paid tribute to my old favorites, and enjoyed a good walk on the elevated pathway.

Great Museum for any age,pavelsB3814EB,There are a lot of different exhibits inside the museum (extra cost) so plan for at least 4 hours of your time to spend there. Don't miss the submarine U-505 exhibit - it's just fantastic. Train model exhibition is also great. Pretty much everything is great there but never enough time to see it all. So we are coming back and back again.,Museum of Science and Industry,May 2019,50

A great place to stop,AdamB16,"This is a fun place to go, especially with kids, but also fin for adults. It has a variety of different exhibits, some of them are interactive. They have a giant domed movie theater that will show a changing selection of short documentaries, so check the museum's website for more information. ",Museum of Science and Industry,September 2019,50
Great view at night!,garykL2086KS,"Certainly the piece may cause you to wonder if it’s worth it, runs $25 a piece.  We decided to go at night and glad we did because the lines were nonexistent:) ",360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,40
Amazing sky high views,hotelmavin,"Pricey at 22 bucks for adults, but a truly magnificent view of Chicago from 94 floors up!  Lots of places to sit and stand, and plenty of windows to snoop on a busy city below from an eagle’s view. Once again, the architecture steals the show, although the lake, it’s boats and navy pier provided other pleasures. They also offer a TILT option, which allows you to lean on a glass bed which tilts forward (for $8). There is also a bar, and having a drink while enjoying the view really added to the fun. ",360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,40

Must do while in Chicago,berniek1949,"This is a lot of fun. You go up to the 95th floor for a view of the entire city. There is an observation deck that allows you to walk all the way around. Very cool during  the day, but spectacular at night.",360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,50

Once is enough,836tomr,"I did this years and years ago.  No need to go again, but if you have not done it and have done the Art Institute and many of the other must sees, well, then this may be for you.   But it is NOT the most important of places to go. ",360 Chicago Observation Deck,July 2019,50
Best museum!,GypsyMiki,I can spend hours here.  Love all the variety of exhibits.  Truly a gem.  Some of the special exhibits require an extra ticket.  This is a well thought out museum and a must see.,Museum of Science and Industry,September 2019,50

View of Chicago,RoyT797,This is the other tower in Chicago to get a 360 degree view of the city.  Also a tilt attraction where you stand in a glass booth and and it tilts forward as if you are falling. This costs an additional $8 if you want to do it. This attraction is included with the City Pass.,360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,50
Beautiful views ruined by horrible staff,Andrea60,"Visited on a quiet Friday morning.  The staff at the ticket counter were cold and dismissive.  But the real winner of the rude contest was the girl inspecting our bags. She stood behind a desk with ear phones on while TALKING ON HER PHONE. My girlfriend asked her ”are you supposed to check our bags”? She nodded but went right on with her phone conversation.  The rest of the staff, from the elevator operator, the tilt ticket lady and cashier, were not as rude as the bag lady, but made us feel like we were interruptions in their lives.   I will say the views from the top of the building were outstanding.  By the way the entire staff behaved I’m guessing management turns a blind eye to this. Such a shame. Tourist are so excited when entering an attraction and it’s sad to be treated this way.",360 Chicago Observation Deck,October 2019,20
Great overview of the city! ,amtmom,Fun way to see ALL of Chicago and the surrounding area. Amazing views and the interactive maps make it fun to identify landmarks and what you are looking at ,360 Chicago Observation Deck,October 2019,40

Extremely interesting,GJCloch,"The museum is super interesting, covers a lot of scientific disciplines, and is well adapted to any type of audience (from small children to science enthusiasts!).

U Boat,john a,"We went mainly to see U 505 which was a good visit, but we were not allowed enough time inside the boat. Unless you paid extra for the other main exhibits it seemed to be aimed at younger visitors, in fact young kids would love it.",Museum of Science and Industry,September 2019,40

Beautiful,aoneistheman,"Yeap.  Second time rising.  Absolutely beautiful.  I’ll be honest, I like this better than Willis, Empire State Building, and even Saint Louis Arch, and possibly the Seattle space needle .  Something about the lake side...I just may do it again!",360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,50
Even More Intriguing in Person,jmho3,It was great to see “the bean” in person. We saw it during clear skies and then again when it was raining. It was so cool to see both times. The clarity of the images is amazing!,Cloud Gate,October 2019,50
Awesome museum,cindyp_nola,The Museum of Science and Industry is full of interesting exhibits for kids of all ages.  The coal mine exhibit and the Tesla Coil demonstration were tops.,Museum of Science and Industry,October 2019,40
Best museum ever? Thumbs up!,HenryKopytka,"There’s endless reviews with all the must dos, so I’ll simply provide this pro tip: find all the Mold-a-Rama machines in the building and but the mold(s). That smell will lock into your kids memories, provide a unique keepsake, and make the drag their kids back there down the road....to hunt down all the machines!",Museum of Science and Industry,July 2019,50
Amazing view of the city in all directions,Josh C,On my trip to Chicago I went up to the 360 Chicago Observation Deck at the Hancock Center and the view was amazing. In fact I enjoyed it enough to return approx 8 hours later. The only thing I would not recommend was the Tilt. But I would highly recommend the observation deck.,360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,50
Tilt,Madkai1408,Awesome views of Chicago from the top. Do the tilt while you are there well worth it and you get great views from a different angle! ,360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,50
Sky Deck - Great 360 Views - 'Tilt' not as scary as I thought it would be,YorkClarets,Had visited the sky deck previously so went especially this time for the 'Tilt' experience. Was a bit disappointed that it wasn't as 'stomach churning' as I'd hoped. SkyDeck def worth a visit if you haven't been before - also try the Sunday Brunch and cocktails !,360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,40

Most fascinating museum--and we're both adults!,babybauer,"My husband and I stopped at the museum with the plan to stay 2-3 hours before driving home to Minnesota.  We stayed about 6 hours and only got through about 3 of the exhibits.  There are so many things to test, and read about, and compare.  It was amazing to see exhibits where adults were as excited (and in some cases, even more excited) as the kids to try some of the different interactive activities.  The ""Wired to Wear"" exhibit was easily one of the most interesting exhibits I've ever seen in a museum, and the Coal Mine was SO informative.  We are actually planning another trip to Chicago so we can spend a full weekend just exploring other exhibits!",Museum of Science and Industry,October 2019,50
"Great views, long wait ",MainelyCamp,"Don’t confuse with Willis tower.  Excellent views.  TVs with interactive view descriptions but not not operational.  Long wait with some videos provided to kill times.  Would have like more info about building, construction, elevator, fun facts like that.",360 Chicago Observation Deck,October 2019,40

Nice museum with very good interactive meteorology section,GrumpyAggie,Overall it was very good. Loved the u boat but could have had more details on the tour. The maker space was disappointing. Would love to see the train display updated with some more trains not just a model train setup. ,Museum of Science and Industry,November 2019,40
nice view,alexandriary,it took a bit for me to find the entrance but once we did they took our picture since it was a group my sister looks like a floating head lol and it was a bit crowded to get down other than that it was a amazing view try the tilt its scary if you dont like heights,360 Chicago Observation Deck,September 2019,50

What a thrill!,Dondra H,"The views of Chicago are amazing from the 94th floor.  You can take pictures from all directions and see forever!  The Tilt is a MUST DO!

A Chicago Must!,EF838SFO,"I grew up in Chicago and this museum was part of my childhood.  I brought my children and grandchildren.  We visited the coal mine (it was darker and louder when I was a kid), the U boat submarine (scarier when I was a kid), the fairy castle (which was twice as big and had three times the rooms when I was a kid) and the flight simulator (which probably wasn't there when I was a kid).  The grandkids loved it.  The grown up kids loved it and were amazed that all the Chicago cousins, of whatever age, had these same experiences.  The museum has been modernized.  There are FabLabs and 3d printers.  But a definite must and a good place to spend a cold, a rainy or a hot day.",Museum of Science and Industry,November 2019,50
Museum of Science and Industry,kskkd,"The Museum of Science and Industry was a disappointment.  I last went 3 years ago.  It was exactly the same on this recent trip.  They also nickel and dime you with extra cost to see anything that is actually new.  They need to include everything in their pricing or make major changes to the exhibits.  The farm, the bikes, the mine, the Christmas trees, the sub, the planes, the trains...seen it once don't need to see it again.",Museum of Science and Industry,November 2019,20
Favorite Chicago museum,779andreyr,"Awesome and interesting exhibits. The submarine and the space center were our favorites, but if highly recommend the science storms and the mirror maze too. Great place to bring your kids.",Museum of Science and Industry,December 2019,50

WOW! Incredible!,carolinesB4085IP,I felt we learned so much in one day.,Museum of Science and Industry,December 2019,50
Should you go to the extra exhibits?,Yessyhara,If you’re only here for one day you can easily fill several hours at this outstanding museum without ever purchasing more tickets. If you go early do the mirror maze first before it gets crowded and dirty (handprints destroy the illusion).  Kids and adults will find plenty to see and do. Easy to get here by transit. We rode our bikes and locked them up right in front. ,Museum of Science and Industry,September 2019,40
"Great view, very calm",LisaN3303,"We got the sun and stars ticket (you can visit twice within 48 hours). Both times we went up, we were almost alone (we visited in November), which provided us with the opportunity to make plenty of pictures and enjoy the amazing view. Definitely worth the money.",360 Chicago Observation Deck,November 2019,50
Best city views day and night,JM1651,Would defo pre book and go early well worth the visit. ,360 Chicago Observation Deck,October 2019,50
Impressive,scoutlee,"I took my 10yo son here.  We visited the Field Museum in the morning, and the MSI in the afternoon.  I was way more impressed with the MSI.  He said he enjoyed them both, but if he could only pick one, he’s choose the MSI.  He loves dinosaurs so obviously Sue was a hit (but that and the bug special exhibit were all that were impressive to him there).  He also is into all things transportation and weather so the MSI was a natural fit.  The German u boat was incredible (we didn’t pay for the inside tour), the 727 was great, and the model train display (and full size train engine you could go in) were fantastic.  The weather area was amazing, too.  Floor to ceiling tornado replica, ability to create a tsunami with different wave sizes and timing, sandstorm replica...A+!  There was so much we didn’t see, but everything we did see was truly above my expectations.",Museum of Science and Industry,November 2019,50
Nice Fall Visit,lmatheny46,"I would give the park a 5, but many of the vendors in the park were closed for the season and the bathrooms weren't really convenient.  I'd recommend allowing several hours, if not all day to visit.  The lake front is close by, if you're able to walk a little distance.",Millennium Park,October 2019,40
Stop at the museum,Juliem7607,We had a wonderful time at the Science and Industry museum. New and thought provoking exibits as well as old favorites. Will stop again soon,Museum of Science and Industry,December 2019,40
