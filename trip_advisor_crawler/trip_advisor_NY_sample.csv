NY Christmas 2019,"This is a must see show. We sat about 8 rows back from the stage, so the view was great. The show was magical and it combines Santa and the birth of Christ. I honestly can’t say enough good things about it.",Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes,50,December 2019,Safari471953
Worth the Money,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed their performance.   The Rockettes were fabulous, but it wasn’t just dancing by the Rockettes. There were other performances that were great too. Everything about the dancing, singing, and set production was awesome and put us in the Christmas spirit.  This show is good for every age!",Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes,50,December 2019,Mia416
Something a bit different!,"Very worthwhile going, lots of variety of food, drink, shopping or just to stop off at one of the cafe’s, there’s something for everyone. The prices vary between shops, but it’s a great place to pick up gifts. It can get quite busy and noisy, pretty much on any day so not for those who don’t like crowds! ",Chelsea Market,50,December 2019,SarcasticPingu
Chill out and Relax,"A nice place to chillax and restore the system after a nice amble on the High Line with plenty of cafes , bars and restaurants to choose from , plus many novelty shops.",Chelsea Market,40,November 2019,R G
Worth a jaunt ,One of the best neighborhoods we visited.,Greenwich Village,40,November 2019,DanTheGreat123
Well Worth a Visit,"This was at least my 5th visit to the museum but my first since they had their big reopening. I did think there were so great changes made but there are others I didn't care for. If you love art, this is definitely a must do for you on a visit to NYC.",The Museum of Modern Art,50,December 2019,Ashley28806
Beyond Architecture ,The Occulus is a giant mall and a subway hub that serves the Financial District.  There are many stores and even restaurants attaches to it.,The Oculus,50,December 2019,foodyholic
A magnificient architectural feat!,"The building is most unusual and very elegant, and highly symbolic. Inside it is less exciting, as it hosts... a shopping mall.",The Oculus,50,November 2019,Seasondtraveller
Beautiful Cathedral,"We arrived shortly before 1pm and after passing through security, we did get to partake in the final minutes of the Mass and then took some pictures before the next Mass started.  We skipped doing the $20 tour option and just explored the Cathedral on our own while enjoying the beauty of our spiritual surroundings.",St. Patrick's Cathedral,40,November 2019,Mary230C
Hard Hat Tour,We did the Hard Hat Tour. It was so cool. I highly recommend doing it. I would not have taken as much out of visiting without going on the tour. Seeing the hospital was so interesting. Our tour guide was very informative and knew the answer to every question anyone asked.  ,Ellis Island,50,December 2019,976paigef
Beautiful building,Main brunch is located in the middle of Manhattan in the beautiful Bryant Park.  Beaux Art style building . Free of charge to enter ,New York Public Library,50,December 2019,O6378WFannag
Moving,One of our goals when we came to New York was to visit ground zero and the 911 museum. The experience was both moving and inspiring. The worst of man kind being offset by the best. The ticketing could of been better with having to question up in one line even though we had purchased our explorer pass before we came. Overall a must for anyone coming to New York.,The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,50,December 2019,Matt C
Very interesting !,"In my opinion it is annoying that you have to pay extra for guided tours, and other experiences on board. Considering the entrance fee is already US$ 33.00. With kids it will be quite an expensive excursion, if you want to do all extra excursions.","Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum",40,December 2019,Geert_AQP
Unique museum,"This the most unique form of museum that we have visited. We chose to include it on our New York City Pass and we are so glad we did! From the moment you walk down the road or turn the corner it’s a very intimidating large spectacle. There was no queue at all because of the time of year so we were in within seconds, we were advised that tours of Concorde would cost extra and told of the times these tours were, we didn’t bother with this as I have been in many Concordes and just wanted to see this one to tick it off my list of visiting the remaining Concordes. The Intrepid itself was brilliant, lots to see and very informative... I could have easily spent the whole day here if it wasn’t for the pesky flight back to the UK! My fiancé really wanted to see the Enterprise as it was a boyhood dream of his and it was brilliant, much larger than we were expecting! But it was breathtaking. We had some loaded fries next which were very well priced and delicious! (Highly recommended). For the last part we went to the Growler submarine which was brilliant (watch your head...), we weren’t rushed or crowded, the only other people we saw in there at the same time were volunteers, and that were superb! A lovely gentleman explained how the showers and toilets worked, how much time the crew had to wash and how the effecting did this in the timeframe, he was so knowledgeable, passionate about the topic and friendly, he was like a breath of fresh air as so many people just know information but don’t have the passion. We felt our few hours here were brilliant and we would LOVE to go back, if we had to pay for the tickets we feel it would have been well worth the price for us. The only downside was the merchandise, we were hoping that they would have had statues of Concorde, the Enterprise of the Black Bird but they didn’t, that was a shame.","Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum",50,January 2019,Pr1nc31
"Lights, cameras, action","It's abuzz with energy and shopping. I love being there. If crowds make you nervous, avoid this area!",Times Square,50,November 2019,Latechgrad
The annex on the fantail of the Intrepid Holds the Enterprise,"It is very cool how they brought in the Shuttle Enterprise and house it on the intrepid. The Enterprise was going to be called The Constitution, BUT the Trekkies got seriously involved.   The Enterprise never went into space, It is the Prototype. The one by which others were built. It does not have Landing gear and a windshield, & tiles. I believe it was dropped from a special 747 at about 60,000 ft for glide tests. It made many glide and landing tests. It was built with no engines or radar.  It supplied the information needed for the Shuttles to go into space.  Very cool to see this Behemoth.

Must see,"There is something about seeing time square lit up at night!!  It’s quite busy, but so many things to see ",Times Square,40,December 2019,jlhatch31
"Shopping New York style, with a trip to the top of the world .. and wheelchair accessible","The Rockefeller Centre is a high-class shopping mall, wheelchair accessible; and we managed to spend hundreds of dollars at the Lego store and other shops there... we also took the opportunity to go up to the top if the skyscraper over the Rockefeller Centre - the Top of the Rock - to see all Manhatten from the sky.",Rockefeller Center,50,November 2019,ericatwell

Like Universeal Studio...ha ha ha,"Lively and easier walking path than 6th avenue to go across. Lots of stores and live charasters out and made me think of Universal Studio (but I suppose this one is the original...:) Lots of characters, I found out, were new form of business. They approach you, be friendly and take pictures, and ask for money afterwards. Just be aware before getting sucked in.",Broadway,40,December 2019,chieandover
Truly the city that never sleeps!,All these places are very easily accessible using the subway. $13 for 7 days unlimited ride in subway Good luck!,Broadway,50,December 2019,Nitha R
"A very long road, diagonal to the streets and avenues; and wheelchair-accessible","Of course we had to visit Broadway to see the lights and theatres around Times Square, and a show: - Disney's Aladdin  - but we didn't realize in advance that Broadway is actually a very long road, running diagonal to the New York grid of streets and avenues, and cutting across them. So it was in effect a short cut (on foot) from our hotel (Hotel @ New York, as we were visiting New York of course!) and Times Square ... with lots of other New York food outlets, and other shops.",Broadway,50,November 2019,ericatwell
Gotta go!,"Fun to see all the exceptional billboards and theatres where wonderful stories, music and dance are celebrated.",Broadway,50,November 2019,Michellechev
Hustle and Bustle is Part of the NYC Experience,Broadway runs north to south in Manhattan but when most people refer to Broadway they mean 42nd Street to 52 Street near the Theater District. Times Square is located here too along with various people-watching activities. Expect large crowds and activity at all hours. ,Broadway,40,December 2019,Christina M
Must go to the top!,"This can be visited as part of a NY multiple sites ticket, or by buying a stand alone one. Whatever you choose do go to them’ top of the rock’ for great views across the Hudson and over the rooftops of Manhattan. There are shops and food halls within the centre and at Christmas there is an ice rink outside, with a great Christmas tree.",Rockefeller Center,50,December 2019,Beverley B

Packed Park,If you go around the Christmas season to Bryant park its quite packed. We usually just stroll in and out limiting the time we spend here,Bryant Park,40,December 2019,Benzman79
A Chill Spot,"A great place to get your head together after fighting the crowds. Sit and listen to some music, eat an ice cream, or order a beautiful dinner from the Bryant Grill. There are tables for chess and other such interactions or just sit and read a book. A real gem.",Bryant Park,50,August 2019,TerryM1701

Husband wish list,"We visited this attraction whilst having a few days in New York as Hubble has a passion to see intrepid.  Both myself and Hubble enjoyed the visit.  Lots of variety both above and below deck, many different areas to look at and enjoy.  The shuttle was amazing to see so close up.  Lots to see and hubbies enjoyment was fab.

What a beautiful building with great architecture and painted ceilings. We absolutely loved it and very glad we found it even if by accident ,New York Public Library,50,November 2019,karenpeet
"One of the world's pre-eminent libraries in a sumptuous building with exhibition spaces, as well as research facilities","This year, I noticed more tourists than ever, probably because of the holidays, but perhaps people are searching for more from NY than the usual. This time I was doing research in their rare book room, but took the opportunity to see an exhibition they have up on the 3rd floor on people, especially authors and performers, who've been inspired by the Library and its many collections. Amazing--go see it, if you can. There's also an exhibition on JD Salinger on the 1st floor that I regret not having time to see. ",New York Public Library,50,December 2019,Jennifer H

I learnt so much,"I thought Ellis Island would just be a tourist trap with a few bits to keep you amused but it was honestly one of the most fascinating and beautiful museums I've ever been too. You could easily spend all day in there and learning so much. It really enlightened me with what was really happening and tells the story of these people in a beautiful way. We times things a little badly so only had an hour or so on the Island so next time I'll be back. I also recommend watching the little video they have set up in the theatres and you learn a lot through that. We also stopped & got chatting to a cleaner who was super knowledgable, friendly & helpful that really made the trip even better.",Ellis Island,50,February 2019,Keeksdeeks
Important Story,"I have wanted to visit Ellis Island for a long time and I certainly was not disappointed.  Ellis Island tells an important story about migration to American, and I definitely recommend a trip if you visit New York. The museum has a lot to look around and take in.  There is a free audio guide also included in your ticket price.  The Cafe food could definitely be improved, they only seemed to serve fast food.  I was there in the morning and there were no breakfast options.  More healthy options would also be nice. I would definitely advise booking an early security check.  I arrived at 8.30 am (my ticket time was 9 am) and there was no line.  By the time I returned from the island, just after lunchtime the queue was huge. Ellis Island tells an important story about migration to American, I definitely recommend a trip if you visit New York.",Ellis Island,50,December 2019,outandaboutwithliz
it was okay,"Times Square was not as impressive as what it seems on New Years eve.  If I compare it to London's Piccadilly Circle, Piccadilly would win out",Times Square,30,December 2019,Beth S
Excellent view and historical sights!,We went on a day trip to Ellis Island by Coach to see Ellis Island and how people from the past came here. They took us around and we got great views of the scenes; the luggage; and the time period.  It was great!  Our date was 6-28-16 on the bus trip.  It also gave us a chance to see the Statue of Liberty.,Ellis Island,50,January 2019,Laurie G
Historical gem,"I booked the Hard Hat tour for myself, my husband and 13 y/o. I am so happy I did. We spent 90 minutes learning the history that so many Americans experienced. The guide was extremely knowledgeable and very patient with us folks who wanted to take extra pictures. If you have a day to enjoy Ellis Island (it really took all day to fully enjoy and appreciate all of the artifacts in the museum in addition to the tour), this spot is a MUST DO! I highly recommend!!!",Ellis Island,50,November 2019,TexasRobyn
If you’ve seen the film.......,"This is an unique building and worth a visit.

Christmas show,"We came to New York last year during the Christmas season and did many wonderful things, but the Rockettes were what brought us back. It’s stunning, it’s joyous, it’s everything Christmas!  Come prepared for a long, poorly organized line to get in, and for a few rude audience members to ignore the cellphone rule, distracting other guests no matter how many times they have been asked not to do this. But do come to see this spectacular show!",Radio City Music Hall,50,December 2019,ILoveTexas

Lovely Christmas Show,"We attended the 11am November 26 performance of Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall.  The 1 1/2 hour show was wonderfully choreographed and even included a 3D segment.  During the nativity scene there were live animals as well.  A donkey, some camels, and some sheep.  A very enjoyable and memorable performance marking the holiday season.",Radio City Music Hall,50,November 2019,Mary230C

The tour included 8 tastings, 6 savory and 2 sweet.  It was a fun and filling experience!!! ",Greenwich Village,40,November 2019,dinak408
"New install and building is overrated. Betye Saar exhibition is a must see, on the other hand.","I may be biased, because I still recall and appreciate the original MoMA building with its stellar, smart, and human-scaled installation of the spectacular collection and the logical traffic flow, which I first saw in 1987. It was still vast but without the gargantuan proportions for MoMA II that we were all waiting for--many years in the making. Those spaces looked like a shopping mall on steroids. Now, we have, after 100s of millions of dollars, MoMA III, which is better than its previous incarnation. It still has a sense of soulessness, perhaps indicative of where we are in the USA and in the field of contemporary art. My review is about the new space, which rates a 1 or 2--collection quality is a 5.",The Museum of Modern Art,30,December 2019,Jennifer H
My Favorite NYC Large Museum,"MOMA just underwent a huge renovation and the results are fantastic.  There seems to be a never ending phalanx of galleries each with incredible exhibits.

Nice Ride,"A quick way to get to Staten Island, very windy, but understandable, also great views of the statue of liberty while on the joureny.",Staten Island Ferry,50,September 2019,Pablopelos
Worth the time and crowds to visit,"We signed up online for our visit, and even so we were in a queue at 9 am on a weekday near Thanksgiving.  The memorial is fantastic.  In fact it is almost overwhelming as it brings such emotions to the surface as we relived that day and the days following in 2001.  We visited NYC with our family in December, 2001 when ground zero was still smoldering.  Our kids remember that visit very well, and this visit to the memorial brought all of that home again.   We spent about 3-4 hours on this visit, and were physically and emotionally exhausted when we finished.  Extremely well done tribute to the many who perished that day in NYC and elsewhere from the terrorist attacks.

On the way you will have great views of the city and the statue. Once you arrive you can either spend time on the island or just come straight back on the next ferry.

Requested Visit,"My grand niece who is not your typical teenager only wanted to see 1 thing while on a stop over in NYC. The Museum of Natural History. She remembered it from a prior visit a few years ago, and wanted a return. I got the tickets online, but for some reason still had to wait in line to enter-however, that was the only glitch. We did everything from Dum Dum to the Planaterium, never walked so much in my life. But it was worth it, because she really enjoyed/loved it.

An extremely enriching experience ,"The name of this museum does not do it justice. It was more than just history. There is just so much to learn about, see and experience here. There were exhibits on all kinds of animals, mammals, insects and dinosaurs.. rich history of American history and other cultures. Spent about 3-4 hours, and we did not cover everything. I will set aside a full day here if time permits ",American Museum of Natural History,50,December 2019,Incredigal
Great place,When staying in New York a visit to Chelsea Market is recommended. The Market is indoors with a lot of different things to see or buy. A lot of different food experiences and several shops located in this old warehouse. We visited this place a rainy day and didn't regret that. ,Chelsea Market,50,December 2019,TomHarald
Something for everyone.,This is an amazing place. The exhibits range from Dinosaurs to the planets and there is usually a special exhibition on. When we visited there was a T. rex exhibition and a Butterfly house option. The tickets can be single entry or you can combine them with one or more exhibitions. If you are in NY and want to visit a number of the sights then look at the pass that covers them all since entry to each one separately will add up.,American Museum of Natural History,50,December 2019,Beverley B

"Great view point, easy cheap fun",It was a little out of the way.  Great little station (one tram was out of commission that day).  Few people.  Great view of the city while going across the river.  Price of one subway ride.  ,The Roosevelt Island Tramway,40,November 2019,1234kidsintow
"Arrived 40 minutes early in line, did not get in until 8:20pm and show started at 8pm",But certainly they wouldn't start the show before letting people in? Wrong. By the time we got through the doors the first act was ending and it was an act my mother had seen photos of and was looking forward to. It was the Rockettes dressed as reindeer. We should absolutely get a refund for this show as we missed part of it through no fault of our own and it made the experience very stressful instead of exciting and magical. I'm hardly new to Broadway shows in NYC and I have never seen such a disorganized mess getting into a theater. And to start the show before dozens and dozens of people had yet to be allowed into the theater is unacceptable. Very disappointing experience.,Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes,10,December 2019,cpolcaro

Skyline views.,Did the Roosevelt Island walk using the very cool tramway to access the island. My Metro card made it a free ride. The walk itself offered a ton of photo ops. The island needs way more info plaques about what I was seeing. Many of the buildings have fascinating histories. Great place for a picnic in the summer.,The Roosevelt Island Tramway,40,December 2019,alankO5582FU
Underwhelming!,"I have ridden on many aerial trams and this one is the shortest and least impressive. Been there, done that!",The Roosevelt Island Tramway,30,December 2019,Butch E
Hidden treasure of New York,Most tourists when think of going to New York never think to go visit medical cloisters. And one of the Rockefeller’s made sure that NYC has a world class attraction from that period as well . Beautiful location and amazing collection of artifacts. Just keep in mind that maps shows that there is a cafe but when we came we were told that there is no cafe in this museum. ,The Met Cloisters,50,December 2019,O6378WFannag
Admiring the Colmar Treasure,"We have enjoyed our visits to the Cloisters in the past, and this visit was no exception. Our specific purpose this time was to see the Colmar Treasure, on loan from the Musee de Cluny in Paris, but it would have been foolish to limit ourselves to that. Once again we admired the Unicorn tapestries and the bust by Tilman Riemenschneider, probably our favourite woodcarver of the later Middle Ages. These are highlights among among the other treasures. Highly recommended!",The Met Cloisters,50,November 2019,operalover939
Overlooked gem in upper Manhattan,"If you were a fan of the 90s animated classic ""Gargoyles,"" You might recall that Demona was hanging out here during the first season when she lures Goliath to cast a spell on him so he'll join her in her hatred of the human race... This might be a bit of a niche factoid for the average visitor, however. If you were terrified by the 80s animated classic ""The Last Unicorn"" as a child, as I was, you will also recognize the unicorn tapestry hanging here, from its brief appearance in that film. If you are not at all familiar with the works mentioned here, then you will still enjoy the scenery and history presented here for your enjoyment at the behest of wealthy industrialists. ",The Met Cloisters,50,January 2019,hehasbalrogsocks
Worth a visit,"Also, your ticket is good for 3 days to the different Met museums. So if you want to go to any of those, you can save some money by planning them around each other.",The Met Cloisters,40,November 2019,thismike
Marvelous Place,Silent contemplation will serve you well at this marvelous historic place. The grounds are beautiful,The Met Cloisters,50,January 2019,oDrJo
1st Trip to NYC,This was the first trip to NYC for my son (11) and daughter (9). We had a jammed packed two days and the One World Observatory was the finale. The views and the education of the city did not disappoint. I would highly recommend the experience to other families.,One World Observatory,50,December 2019,mulcahymw
Beautiful place!,Awesome building with breathtaking views. Nice experience. Great and attentive staff. Drinks kind of pricey ($17 for a beer) but great place overall. ,One World Observatory,50,December 2019,Ray C
So many sites to see it from!,"The usual place to view this from, is Brooklyn. The broad walk there offers a range of vistas depending on your choice of foreground. You also get a good view from the East river ferry, and from Manhattan bridge.",Manhattan Skyline,50,December 2019,Beverley B
Go Early,I live downtown and like to take visiting friends for a walk on the bridge. Just go early to avoid crowds and don't even think about taking a bike unless you use the Williamsburg Bridge which is another great thing to do to avoid crowds and to check out Wburg.,Brooklyn Bridge,50,October 2019,Rachel S
Go up even with bad visibility if you have to use tickets,"Enjoyed the visit even though visibility very poor(had no choice to use ticket as we were leaving). They did offer to us to use the tickets for another day, which was nice but we could not do. Still, had some cloud clearing and got to see decent amount and the coolest part is that we were virtually alone. Had a drink in the bar which is a super cool area, all in all very enjoyable!",One World Observatory,50,December 2019,Brigid C
Visit the Christmas Mkt at Grand Central,We always do a walk through of Grand Central Station on our way to the Christmas Market they have here in December.,Grand Central Terminal,50,December 2019,therealbrianr
Crown visit,"Booked well in advance to get crown tickets. Security is strict, went through two sets of scanners which can take time. Only attempt the crown if you can handle tight spaces. Lots of steps and coming down is worse.  Not a lot of space or time when you get to the top but worth it just to say you’ve got there.",Statue of Liberty,50,December 2019,Julie S
Go here ,A beautiful peaceful (ish) place in a busy city. A lovely walk with artists and stands along the way. Easy to navigate and interesting ,The High Line,50,December 2019,HappyfeetLeeds
Well worth the trip over to Liberty Island,"The new museum on the island is great too, as it has an insight into how the statue was made. To top of the experience the original torch is in the museum and it’s fantastic to see that up close too. ",Statue of Liberty,50,December 2019,adventurecouple101
Terrible customer service.  RUDE ,"In December 2019 we visited the top of the rock .  Of course the view is amazing.  Whoever the employees n manager on the top floor were unprofessional and very rude. After being treated like cattle our group was place in time out for not standing on each other.  Finally several guest demanded to speak to management as we were being held hostage and unable to board the down elevators.  The manager, without witnessing the events or inquiring as to what happened told the group he believes n supports his employee.  Trust me this guys was crazy.  Do yourself a favor and go to the Empire State Building.  Super nice staff there ",Top of the Rock,10,December 2019,477andrewg
"Amazing view, huge waiting lines","Sure, it is probably the best view in town. Sure, it is worth the money. Nevertheless, waiting in huge lines and again coming back at a later time for the visit is impossible for someone who is there on vacations and trying to see stuff. The VIP pass worked perfectly for me though! Got passed the line and visited the top with priority",Top of the Rock,40,December 2019,aktsar
Fantastic view,"Went at sunset, what a fabulous sight. Well organised if you buy tickets beforehand & go back at designated time.",Top of the Rock,50,December 2019,jeany1960

Empire State Building view and museum..,"The museum although having a fun King Kong room - is not what I would consider a museum about the building. There is some art work creations and videos, images from movies and pics of celebrities that have been there... I was expecting to see maybe bolts and tools used and lots of original photos...but was disappointed to have one room with lots of text on the walls and the rest more like an art and celebrity exhibit. King king room was cool but so over crowded I couldn’t get a photo without 20 people in the shot.",Empire State Building,30,December 2019,Carly H
One of the world's great museums.,"The Met is huge and has a world class collection of art and artifacts from many cultures and countries, from different historical periods. So you can see modern art, a great range of European art, as well as ancient Egypt, African, Middle Eastern, Asian and so on. There are always interesting special exhibitions. Don't forget the ""Met"" includes The Met Breuer for modern art and the Cloisters and a single ticket gets you all three for one day (which is nice but impossible). Also check out concerts, especially around the holidays. If you plan to visit more than once a year with a guest, check out the membership options. The museum has a number of restaurants. Don't bother with the Petrie Court or the American Court Cafés -- you might as well go to the Cafeteria. The 4th floor Dining Room is expensive and I haven't eaten there. Nor have I tried Great Hall Balcony Cafe. The Met is divided into sections. Plan your visit, or pick and area and just discover. For art lovers, it's must.",The Metropolitan Museum of Art,50,October 2019,Davis H
My favorite museum,"For many years I did not particularly like the Met.  How could it compare to the European greats?  And then I realized that is what makes it great.  Very few blockbusters.  No masses of crowds taking selfies, but never looking at the art.  The Met is a wonderful place to wander around, expose yourself to human culture, and learn.  I have come to love it.",The Metropolitan Museum of Art,50,December 2019,davidmoniz
Don't know if there is ever enough time here,"went to see the Marvels exhibit whihc was terrific. Went early so not too crowded on a Sunday am, very busy by the time we left. We go everytime we are in New York and love it.",The Metropolitan Museum of Art,50,December 2019,Steve S

Amazing place ,"What a lovely park. The whole experience was really great. Street entertainers, skating rink, the boat house for a coffee. My favourite place ",Central Park,50,December 2019,jeany1960
A slice of beauty in a world of steel,Biking through the park was a great way to see more of the beauty in less time.  Can be hilly though so be prepared!,Central Park,50,November 2019,SSJD8
My favorite museum in NY,"I have the pleasure of being able to visit this museum quite regularly and it’s one of my favorite ways to spend my day. There’s art that spans all genres and has great armory exhibit. There are a few meal options inside and some even serve alcohol. Also, don’t forget to go see the exhibits on the rooftop. There are really nice views of Central Park and Manhattan from there.",The Metropolitan Museum of Art,50,September 2019,lazyseoul
Tour of the North Woods,"This was a terrific and informative tour by one of the many volunteers of the Central Park Conservancy.  The tour began at the Discovery Center at 110th Street (which also features ongoing and changing exhibitions) and proceeded outdoors around the Harlem Meer and into the North Woods.  Information included elements of the history of the park and its design, as well as what can currently be seen and experienced and what is planned for the future.  The Conservancy offers no- and low-cost tours of many parts of the park.  A full calendar can be found on the park's website.",Central Park,50,December 2019,claudine97th

Sunday is the day to go...no lines or crowds,"I took my daughter and her best friend to the Empire State Building during our 16th birthday NYC trip, and it was awesome!  The new museum is really interesting, and the staff were all so friendly and helpful.  Tip - go on Sunday  morning instead of Saturday!  Lines were wrapped around the block on Saturday so we came back on Sunday and there were no lines at all.  ",Empire State Building,50,December 2019,NoelleS273

Amazing,A goal of ours was to go up to the top in the evening. Getting in was so easy no queuing for tickets we swiped our explorer pass and into the interactive area first reading how the building was put up in 14 months and then going into the king Kong area. The ride up is also an experience in itself.when you get to the first drop off area the views are great but on the viewing gallery outside after the second elevator ride they are excellent.

A must visit.,"This is an amazing place all year around. The walk now has many places where you can ‘get off’ along the way. If you like plants and gardens you will be impressed with the way this old railway like has been converted into a garden above the bustle of New York. There are many viewing points and seating along the way, and at weekends there are stalls u see the bridges selling trinkets, coffee etc.",The High Line,50,December 2019,Beverley B

Very interesting and historic building.,My husband and I did a walking tour of Grand Central Station with a group called Free Tours by Foot. We highly recommend this particular tour which is held on Sunday mornings at 10 am. The main hall has signs of the zodiac on the ceiling and a spectacular clock at the information desk. There is a very nice seafood restaurant and several other eateries. There is also a wonderful food market in the terminal. The tour also included information on the nearby Chrysler Building which is a fine example of Art Deco design. The tour is free and you can make a donation to the leader if you enjoyed the tour. ,Grand Central Terminal,50,June 2019,pubcrawlwer
Busy but very photogenic.,"This is a functional station and so has commuters as well as tourists. There is an extensive dining area in the basement and a really good market on the main floor. Be prepared to jostle with other people wanting ‘that view’ across the main thoroughfare, including wedding photo shoots. Be aware photographers, that tripods are not allowed to be used here, unless you have applied for permission beforehand.",Grand Central Terminal,50,December 2019,Beverley B

A great walk,This bridge is a great way to see the Manhattan Skyline both during the day and at night.  It’s about 2 miles across and you can’t beat the view ,Brooklyn Bridge,50,November 2019,Californiagirl
You don’t have to cross it to enjoy it!,"This is a very, very popular tourist site. Hundreds of people cross it in order to take photos...usually selfies...from the Manhattan side. Early morning or late evening avoids the main crowd. Be aware that you need to stick to one side of the bridge or incur the wrath of cyclists or worse!",Brooklyn Bridge,40,December 2019,Beverley B
Fantastic walk,We walked across the fabulous bridge from Dumbo to battery park on a beautiful day. Great scenery! Some great features such a worthwhile visit ,Brooklyn Bridge,50,December 2019,jeany1960
So sorry I waiting so long to do this!!!,"Even being a lifelong New Yorker this was the first time I walked across the bridge...what a mistake for waiting so long!  So amazing!!!   I think that these are the best views of NYC.  You can see all of downtown and good chunk of midtown as well.  We went on a magnificent day so the views are outstanding.  We started on the NYC side.  Don't be discouraged when you first start...its crazy crowded but the crowd thins out quickly.   It's a nice easy walk, with plenty of places to take great photos and benches to sit you want/need to.    If you are a tourist do this!! And if you are from the area don't wait as long as I did!!",Brooklyn Bridge,50,December 2019,petezippy
